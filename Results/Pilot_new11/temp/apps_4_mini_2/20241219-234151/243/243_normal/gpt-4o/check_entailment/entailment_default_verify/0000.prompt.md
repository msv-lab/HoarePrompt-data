You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the logic and implementation involved.

The problem requests a function that finds the count of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros. It also states that the function should output these integers in increasing order.

**Analysis of the Program:**

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function correctly computes the number of trailing zeros in \( n! \) by counting how many times the factors of 5 can be derived from the numbers up to \( n \) (since trailing zeros are created by pairs of factors 2 and 5, and there are typically more factors of 2 than 5).

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**: 
   - The binary search is set up correctly between `low` and `high`.
   - The output is properly initialized, and when the trailing zeroes calculated with `func_1(mid)` equals `m`, it looks for boundaries (the range of \( n \) for which the factorial has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros).
   - It effectively decreases to find the left boundary and increases to find the right boundary to gather all integers \( n \) for which \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros before returning them.

**Edge Cases:**
- Since the question indicates \( m \) can be as large as 100,000, it's worth checking whether the upper limit correctly handles large values. 
- One critical aspect is how `func_2(m)` behaves when there's no integer \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeros. The program should return a count of `0` and an empty list in this scenario, which seems to be accounted for.

**Testing Various Cases:**
- For \( m = 0 \) (though not allowed in the constraints), typical behavior must return multiple integers since trailing zeros would be created by all \( n \geq 5 \).
- For \( m = 1 \), we should get an output of \( [5] \) instead of the expected \( [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \).
- Testing other values like \( m = 5 \) which is cleverly constructed around edge cases can provide insight too.

By evaluating the behavior of the provided Python program along with the outlined examples, it becomes evident that there might be a crucial misunderstanding regarding how many integers would fulfill the requirement based on the counting boundary.

**Conclusion:**
Upon re-evaluating the case when \( m = 1 \):
The expected output states 5 integers whereas \( 5! \) generates \( 1 \) trailing zero.

Thus, this program does not behave correctly for inputs and does not strictly follow the problem description's requirement.

Correctness: **False**. 

We have identified a mismatched scenario for values \( m = 1 \), where the actual expected output does not align with the program's behavior leading to an incorrect verdict.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000) and searches for all integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It utilizes a binary search strategy with a helper function `func_1` to count the trailing zeroes of `n!`. If it finds a range of integers that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it collects those integers into a list named `result`. If no such integers are found, the function returns an empty list. It is important to note that if `func_1` has not been adequately designed to handle the calculation of trailing zeroes for all potential `n`, this could lead to incomplete or incorrect results. Finally, the function returns the list of integers which reflect the extent of `m` trailing zeroes corresponding to their factorials.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
