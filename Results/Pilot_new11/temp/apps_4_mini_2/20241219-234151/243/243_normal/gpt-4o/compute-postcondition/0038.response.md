The variable `result` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables retain their previous states and are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list**.
