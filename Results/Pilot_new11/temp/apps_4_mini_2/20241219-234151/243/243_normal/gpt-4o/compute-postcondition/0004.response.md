The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, we can express `mid` as `(0 + 5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`.**
