After executing the code `result = []`, the variable `result` is assigned an empty list. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `result` while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the output of `func_1(mid)`; and `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m.**
