According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute since its condition is always true. There are no conditions that need to be modified for the loop to execute; it is guaranteed to run at least once. Hence, we can keep the given state the same without any adjustments.

State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1**
