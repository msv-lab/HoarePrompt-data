Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `m` from user input within the range of 1 to 100,000. It calculates the maximum integer `count` such that `n // 5 ** count` is still greater than or equal to `m` for `n` initialized to 1. Next, it constructs a list `ans` that contains all integers starting from 1 up to the maximum `n_final` where `n // 5 ** count` is still greater than or equal to `m`. Finally, it outputs the length of the list `ans` and prints the elements of `ans`. The function does not handle any case where `m` is less than or equal to 0, although the precondition states that `m` will be a positive integer. Additionally, if `m` exceeds 100,000, the behavior is not defined by the function logic, despite the input constraints.**
