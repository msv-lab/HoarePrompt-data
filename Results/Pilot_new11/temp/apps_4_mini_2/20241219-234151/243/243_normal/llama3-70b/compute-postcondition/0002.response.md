`n` is assigned the value of 1. The previous values of the affected variables (`m` and `count`) are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1.

Output State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 0; `n` is 1**
