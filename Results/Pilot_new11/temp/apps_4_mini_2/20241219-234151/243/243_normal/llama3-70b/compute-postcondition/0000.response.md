The value of `m` is re-assigned with the value obtained from `int(input())`, which changes the previous state of `m`. The initial condition states that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`. After executing the code, `m` can take any positive integer value that is input by the user within the same range. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000.**
