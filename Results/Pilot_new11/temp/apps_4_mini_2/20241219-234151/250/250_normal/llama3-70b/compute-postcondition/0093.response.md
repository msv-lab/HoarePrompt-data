According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. For the loop to execute, the `additional_marks` list must contain at least one element, as the loop iterates over it. The current state requires that `j` represents each element of `additional_marks` during the iterations.

Since the goal is to start the loop, I also need to account for the state of `i`, even though `i` is not directly used within the loop body, it is part of the overall state that could affect the loop's context.

Hereâ€™s how to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
1. `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element for the loop to execute.
2. `j` should be set to the first element of `additional_marks` during the first iteration.
3. The condition regarding `i` is already satisfied implicitly, as it must be less than `n` and defined as "the next index in the marks list," which does not interfere with the loop.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect these requirements:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `i` is less than `n`, `marks` contains at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`**.
