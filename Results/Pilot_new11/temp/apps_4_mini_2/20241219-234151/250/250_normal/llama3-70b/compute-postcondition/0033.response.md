The variable `need_y` is explicitly assigned the value `True`, but no logical conditions are affected or altered. The initial states of `n`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions regarding `marks[j] - marks[i]` relate to variables `x` and `y` are unchanged. Thus, no calculations occur as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [2, 100000]; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`; `need_x` is True; `need_y` is True.**
