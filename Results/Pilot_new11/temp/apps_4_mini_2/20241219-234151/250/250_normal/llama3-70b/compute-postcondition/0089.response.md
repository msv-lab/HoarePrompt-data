The code appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. Since `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`, its specific value is known, and `i` is the next index after the current `i`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Thus, the output state reflects the new value appended to the `additional_marks` list, without altering the other initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `i` is the next index after the current `i`; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `additional_marks` contains at least 4 elements with the new element being `i + j`; `j` is the third element in `additional_marks`.**
