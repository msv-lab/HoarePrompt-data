Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `i` is the next index after the current `i`, `marks` must contain at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. The current value of `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and `i + j` is not an element of `marks`.***
