Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the marks on the ruler with `a[0]` being 0 and `a[n-1]` being `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `need_x` is set to True, while `need_y` is set to True, `i` remains 0, and `j` remains 0. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `y`, then `need_y` is updated to True and the condition `marks[j] - marks[i]` holds true also showing that it equals `x`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
