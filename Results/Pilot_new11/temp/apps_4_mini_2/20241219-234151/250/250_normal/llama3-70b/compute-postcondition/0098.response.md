The `additional_marks` list is modified by appending a new value, which is calculated as `i + j`. Since `i` is less than `n` and both `i` and `j` are positive integers, the appended value will also be a positive integer. The preconditions remain valid since no constraint on `n`, `l`, `marks`, or the second element of `additional_marks` is violated by this operation. 

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `i` is less than `n`, `marks` contains at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` now contains at least `n + 1` elements where the last element added is `i + j`.**
