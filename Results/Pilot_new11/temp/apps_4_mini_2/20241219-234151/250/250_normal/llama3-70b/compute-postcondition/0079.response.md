To analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the impact of the loop code and the initial variable conditions.

The loop checks integers in `additional_marks`, starting with `x` and `y`, and attempts to append `i + j` to `additional_marks` if certain conditions are met (i.e., whether `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`).

1. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - If `additional_marks` initially contains `x` and `y`, it will execute at least once for the first value of `j` (which would be either `x` or `y`).
   - For subsequent additions, `i + j` needs to continually satisfy the two conditions: being â‰¤ `l` and not present in `marks`.

2. **Final State Determination:**
   - If the loop executes multiple times, `additional_marks` will have increased by the values `i + j` that satisfy the conditions set forth.
   - If the conditions are met each time for different iterations over `j`, `additional_marks` can grow significantly until no more valid additions can be made.

3. **Confirmed Values After All Iterations:**
   - Given the constraints that `x`, `y`, `l`, and other variables are bound within the provided limits, we will conclude that:
   - `additional_marks` may contain multiple entries based on valid additions of `i + j`.
   - If expansion of `additional_marks` stops (a situation where none of the additions meet the criteria), the final state of key variables will have to reflect this stopping point.

Thus, based on the above reasoning, the final output state after all iterations of the loop executes will depend on the original values but will reflect potential additions made during those iterations.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `i` is the original value of `n-1`; `additional_marks` contains the original integers `x`, `y`, and all valid integers of the form `i + j` that are <= `l` and not in `marks`. If no further integers can be added, the final size of `additional_marks` has reached its maximum.**
