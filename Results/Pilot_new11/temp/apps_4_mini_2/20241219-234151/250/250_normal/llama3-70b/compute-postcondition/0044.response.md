The variable `need_x` is assigned the value `True`, but its previous state could have been either `True` or `False`. The value of `need_y`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `marks` remains unchanged. The variable `need_x` now determines that some condition or requirement related to `x` is necessary for the logic ahead. Thus, we must acknowledge the state of `need_x` while also noting that it can influence conditional logic in the future.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [2, 100000]; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `need_x` is True; `need_y` is True or False; `marks` is the same as the initial set of integers from the input; and the current value of `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`.**
