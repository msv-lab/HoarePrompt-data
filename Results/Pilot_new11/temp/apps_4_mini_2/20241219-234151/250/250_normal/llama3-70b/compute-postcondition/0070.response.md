Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `additional_marks` contains at least the integers `x` and `y`, and the current values of `i` and `j` satisfy `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.***
