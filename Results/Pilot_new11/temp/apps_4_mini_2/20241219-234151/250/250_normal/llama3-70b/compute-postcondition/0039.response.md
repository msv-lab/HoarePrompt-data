Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range [3, 100000]; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`; `marks[j] - marks[i]` is not equal to `y`; `need_x` is True; and `need_y` is True. In this case, since `marks[j] - marks[i]` is not equal to `y`, the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is false and no changes occur in the state of the program.***
