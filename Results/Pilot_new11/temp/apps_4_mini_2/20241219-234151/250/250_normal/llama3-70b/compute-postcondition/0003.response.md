According to the code, the execution of the loop is primarily determined by the variable `n`, which is already stated to be a positive integer within the range of 2 to 100,000. Therefore, it guarantees that the loop will execute for the values of `i` starting from 0 to `n-1`. 

The states that would need to be recognized or implied to track the loop's execution are:
- The variable `i` should start at 0 when the loop begins its first execution.
- `a` must be an appropriately initialized list of length `n` containing integers, with `a[0]` guaranteed to be 0 and `a[n-1]` guaranteed to be `l`. Thus the list satisfies the conditions stated.
- The variables `need_x` and `need_y` do not affect the execution of the loop directly since they are just boolean flags without impact on the loop's mechanics.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= l <= 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < y <= l, `a` is a list of n integers representing the marks on the ruler with `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `i` is 0**.
