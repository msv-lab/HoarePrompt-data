The code appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. Since the conditions state that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, and all involved variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged other than `additional_marks`, which will contain an additional integer, the output state reflects these updates.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `additional_marks` contains at least the integers `x`, `y`, and now also contains `i + j`, and the current values of `i` and `j` satisfy `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.**
