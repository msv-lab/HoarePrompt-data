Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (number of marks), l (length of the ruler), x, and y (both are distances between marks). It reads a set of n marks from input, checks if there are pairs of these marks with differences equal to x and y, and tracks whether additional marks are needed. If neither difference is found, it includes x and y in a list of additional marks. It then computes all unique sums of existing marks with these additional marks, ensuring they do not surpass the length l and aren't already in the initial marks. The function concludes by printing the count of these additional marks and the marks themselves. Missing logic includes the necessity to ensure that the additional marks always remain unique, and whether the final list should retain order or specific limit checks. Overall, the function helps to determine notable distances between available marks and potentially expand the range of notable positions on the ruler.**
