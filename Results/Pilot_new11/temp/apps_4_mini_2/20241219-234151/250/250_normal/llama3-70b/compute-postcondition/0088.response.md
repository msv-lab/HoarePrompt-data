According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` has at least 3 elements, then the loop will execute again for the third element, and `j` will be updated to the next element in `additional_marks`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements, and since `j` is the next element, the current value of `j` must be the second element in `additional_marks`. To execute the loop one more time, `additional_marks` must now contain at least 3 elements, and `j` will be updated to the third element in `additional_marks`. The state of `i` should also be adjusted according to the loop logic.

Therefore, considering the loop execution, the next values would be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `i` is the next index after the current `i`, `marks` contains at least `n` elements, and `additional_marks` must contain at least 3 elements with `j` being the third element in `additional_marks`.**
