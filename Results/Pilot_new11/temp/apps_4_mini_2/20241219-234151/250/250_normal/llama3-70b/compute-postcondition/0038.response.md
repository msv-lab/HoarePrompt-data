The statement `need_y = True` does not change the value of `need_y` since it is already `True`. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [3, 100000]; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `x`; `marks[j] - marks[i]` is not equal to `y`; `need_x` is True; `need_y` is True.**
