Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers satisfying 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `i` is less than `n`; `marks` remains unchanged and contains at least `n` elements; `additional_marks` contains all elements that are the result of `i + j` for each `j` in `additional_marks` where `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not present in `marks`. The final state of `additional_marks` may contain an arbitrary number of additional elements as per the above conditions.**
