The `marks` variable is assigned a set created from a list of integers taken from input. The contents of this list are not given, but it is assumed to be valid integers that represent additional marks on the ruler. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= l <= 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < y <= l; `a` is a list of n integers representing the marks on the ruler, where a[0] = 0 and a[n-1] = l; `marks` is a set of integers from the input.**
