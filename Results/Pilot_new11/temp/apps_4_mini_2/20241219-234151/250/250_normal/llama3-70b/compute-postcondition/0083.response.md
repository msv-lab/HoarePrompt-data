The operation `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. Given the constraints, `i + j` is less than or equal to `l`, and it's confirmed that `i + j` is not an element of `marks`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `i` is the next index after the current `i`, `marks` must contain at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` now contains one more element which is `i + j`, and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`.**
