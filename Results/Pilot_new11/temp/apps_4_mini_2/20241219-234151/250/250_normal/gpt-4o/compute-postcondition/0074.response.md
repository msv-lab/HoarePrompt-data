Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`. If `not y_found` is true and `not x_found`, then if `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` exists in `marks_set`, `new_marks` includes `mark + y`. Otherwise, if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is present in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes the value `mark - y`. If `not y_found` is true and `x_found` is true, then `new_marks` remains unchanged. If `not y_found` is false, there are no changes made to `new_marks`.***
