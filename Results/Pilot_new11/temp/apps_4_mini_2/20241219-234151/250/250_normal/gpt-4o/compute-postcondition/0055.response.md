The variable `new_marks` is a set that will include the value `mark - x`, where `mark` is iterating over `marks_set`. The previous state of `marks_set` is not changed, and `mark` is being processed in `marks_set` during this iteration. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `new_marks` has included the value calculated from the current `mark` being processed minus `x`. All other variables remain unchanged unless indicated otherwise.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; if `y_found` is False and for some `mark` in `marks_set`, either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark + y`. Otherwise, if either `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` includes `mark - y; currently processing mark is the next mark in `marks`; `new_marks` has included `mark - x`.**
