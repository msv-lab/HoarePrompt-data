The code `new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. The variables `mark` and `x` are known, but `new_marks` is being updated by including this new calculated value.

Before executing this line, we know the following:
- `mark` is an integer (the current mark being processed).
- `x` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`.
- `new_marks` is a set that already contains certain values based on previously established conditions.

The preconditions remain valid, and since `mark` is updated for each iteration of processing in `marks_set`, we don't know its specific value at this point. The value of `new_marks` expands by including `mark + x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l; `y` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; `new_marks` is updated to include `mark + x`.**
