According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the `marks` list. Given that `marks` is a non-empty list, for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to proceed to the next element in the `marks` list. At the end of the last iteration, `mark` is the current element in `marks`. 

To determine the next state, we must consider the following:
1. The variable `marks` has at least one element left to iterate over.
2. `mark` should be updated to the next element in `marks`.

Since `marks` is non-empty, after finishing processing the current `mark`, we can deduce that `mark` will take the value of the next element in the list. If we denote `current_index` as the index of the current `mark`, then at the start of the next iteration, it would be `current_index + 1`. 

As we do not know the exact values or length of the `marks` list from the provided details, we can summarize that `mark` needs to be the next element in the `marks` list and `current_index` should also update accordingly. 

Putting all of this together, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`; mark is the next element in the `marks` list.**
