To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop statement. The loop iterates over `marks`, which is a list of integers.

1. **Check the loop dependency**: For the loop to run, `marks` should contain at least one element. Therefore, the list `marks` must not be empty.

2. **Current State**: The initial state indicates that `marks` is a list of integers, and it may or may not have elements in it. We need to enforce that it contains at least one integer for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjustments needed**: We will specify that `marks` must have at least one integer. The loop variable `mark` is assigned to the first element of the list during its first iteration.

4. **Implications of the execution**: If the loop starts executing, `mark` will refer to the first element of `marks`. 

Thus, to summarize the adjustments needed for the loop to be executable:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; `mark` is the first element of `marks` during the first iteration.**
