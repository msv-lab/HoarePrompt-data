Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, the output printed is 0. Otherwise, if `new_marks` is not empty, it contains elements based on valid conditions checked for each `mark` in `marks`, and the last element of `new_marks` is printed and removed from the list, while both `x_found` and `y_found` flags remain unchanged. If `new_marks` is empty, then `x_found` is False, `y_found` is False, and `result` includes the values of `x` and `y.***
