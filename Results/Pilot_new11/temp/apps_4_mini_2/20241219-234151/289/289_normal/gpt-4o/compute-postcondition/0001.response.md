The value of `max_games` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`, which calculates the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, and then subtracts 1 from that. Since `n` is an input integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \), `n.bit_length()` will yield values that correspond to the binary representation of `n`. The possible range for `max_games` will be from 1 (for n=2, representing binary "10") up to 59 for \( n = 10^{18} \) (which in binary is approximately "110111100000101101101011001110101101111011001110010"). Thus, the output state includes updates for `max_games`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `max_games` is an integer between 1 and 58 inclusive, calculated as `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
