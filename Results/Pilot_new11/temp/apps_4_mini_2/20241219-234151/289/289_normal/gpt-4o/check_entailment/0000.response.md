Correctness: **False**.

The program intends to calculate the maximum number of games a player can play in the tournament based on the provided problem description. However, the logic used (`n.bit_length() - 1`) does not correctly yield the number of games the winner can participate in according to the knockout tournament rules.

To demonstrate this, consider the input `n = 5`. Based on the rules, player 1 can play against players 2, 3, and 4, but can't play against player 5 after defeating two players due to the game count rules. Thus, player 1 would only play 3 games.

However, `n.bit_length()` for `n = 5` is `3`, so `n.bit_length() - 1` equals `2`, which is incorrect for this case.

Therefore, this case (n = 5) shows that the program does not work as intended, confirming that the correctness is **False**.
