The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input that is an integer, provided that it satisfies the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. The initial constraints on `n` remain valid. The output state then captures this.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament, and `n` is now an input integer.**
