You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Famous Brazil city Rio de Janeiro holds a tennis tournament and Ostap Bender doesn't want to miss this event. There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.

Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.

Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
3

Output
2

Input
4

Output
2

Input
10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.

In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.

In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. 

In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the program and the requirements of the task.

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given `n` players. 

Here are the detailed requirements:
1. Two players can play against each other only if the difference in the number of games played by each player is at most 1.
2. We need to calculate how many games the winner can participate in.

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)
```

The key function here is `n.bit_length()`, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary. This effectively calculates the maximum power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. 

### Analysis of correctness

1. **Understanding `bit_length`:**
   - The expression `n.bit_length()` gives the position of the highest bit that is set. For instance:
     - For `n = 2` (binary `10`), `bit_length()` is 2, leading to `2 - 1 = 1`.
     - For `n = 3` (binary `11`), `bit_length()` is 2, leading to `2 - 1 = 1`.
     - For `n = 4` (binary `100`), `bit_length()` is 3, resulting in `3 - 1 = 2`.
     - This is indeed the correct maximum number of games for the players.

2. **Checking edge cases:**
   - For `n = 5`, `bit_length()` returns 3, resulting in `3 - 1 = 2`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 6`, `bit_length()` also returns 3, and for `n = 7`, it returns 3, both leading to a maximum of 2 games.
   - For `n = 8`, `bit_length()` returns 4, resulting in `4 - 1 = 3`, which is correct.
   - Continuing with higher numbers (up to the maximum limit of \(10^{18}\)), we find that the pattern holds. This represents the rounds of the knockout tournament correctly.

Considering all of the inputs available within the input constraints, we can see that the implementation correctly calculates the maximum number of games played by the winner following the rules of player pairing in a knockout format.

### Conclusion

The program consistently returns correct outputs for all potential cases of `n` falling in the specified range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Therefore, based on our evaluation, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all possible edge cases within the defined range.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input `n`, which represents the number of players in a tournament with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It then computes and prints the integer value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. This operation effectively calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, minus one. The function does not take any parameters and also does not handle any edge cases, such as invalid input or values of `n` outside the specified range. After execution, the program does not return any value; it only prints the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
