The variable `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The conditions regarding `num` remain the same; it still must be greater than or equal to `i * i + 2 * i + 1` after the increment of `i`. 

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to `i * i + 2 * i + 1` after the increment of `i`, `count` is increased by 1**.
