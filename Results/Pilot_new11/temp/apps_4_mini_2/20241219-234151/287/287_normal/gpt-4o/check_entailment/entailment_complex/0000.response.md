Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires the function to find the number of different weights of splits of a number \( n \), which is defined by the nonincreasing sequences of positive integers that sum up to \( n \). 

However, the provided program, `func_1`, calculates the total number of divisors of the input integer \( n \). The logic of counting divisors is unrelated to the concept of splits and their weights. It does not account for the nonincreasing sequence aspect nor does it consider how many times the first element appears in any valid splits.

Therefore, the program does not solve the problem as required and therefore is incorrect.
