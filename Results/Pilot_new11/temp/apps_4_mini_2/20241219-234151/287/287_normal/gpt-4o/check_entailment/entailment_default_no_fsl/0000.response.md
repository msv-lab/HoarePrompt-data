Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The objective is to find the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \), which is defined as nonincreasing sequences of positive integers that sum to \( n \). 

However, the function `func_1` computes the total number of divisors of \( n \) instead of the number of different weights of splits. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem's requirements. The output hints confirm this, as they explain that the function counts divisors and not weights of splits.

For instance, for an input of \( n = 8 \), the expected counts of different weights for splits are 5, but the program will output the number of divisors of 8, which is 4 (the divisors are 1, 2, 4, and 8). Therefore, multiple cases exist where the program does not function as required in the description. Hence, the program is incorrect.
