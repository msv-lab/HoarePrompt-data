To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation.

The problem is to find the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The program defines a function `func_1(num)` which calculates a count based on the divisors of `num`. This approach is not aligned with the requirement to count the number of different weights of the splits.

### Potential Issue
The weight of a split is defined by the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element of the split, and to solve the problem, we need to be concerned with how many such weights can be formed, depending on the integer partitions of `n`.

The program counts the number of divisors of `n` instead, which does not correspond to the split weights as described. For example:
- For `n = 7`, valid splits include:
  - [7] -> weight 1
  - [3, 3, 1] -> weight 2
  - [2, 2, 2, 1] -> weight 3
  - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> weight 7
Thus, the weights collected should be {1, 2, 3, 7} which means there are 4 different weights.

However, running the given program will not yield the correct result as it counts the number of divisors, not the distinct weights determined by the valid splits. 

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the count of different weights of splits of `n`, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.

This is evident because, for any number `n`, the outputs based on counting divisors will not provide the correct weights as illustrated by the discrepancies given in the problem statement.
