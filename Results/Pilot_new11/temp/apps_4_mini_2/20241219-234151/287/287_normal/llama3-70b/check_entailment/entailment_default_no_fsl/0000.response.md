Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to calculate the number of different weights of the splits of a positive integer \( n \). However, the code is incorrectly counting the number of divisors of \( n \) instead of finding the different weights of its splits.

The program logic does not align with the problem statement, which explicitly asks for the number of different weights corresponding to valid splits of \( n \). It simply calculates the number of divisors, which is irrelevant to the problem described. The outputs from the given examples do not correlate with the logic implemented in the code.

For instance:
- For \( n = 7 \), the expected output according to the problem description is `4` (weights corresponding to splits of \( 7 \)). However, running the program will produce the total count of divisors of \( 7 \), which is `2`.
- For \( n = 8 \), the expected output is `5`, but again, if you run the program, it will output the number of divisors of \( 8 \), which is `4`.

This discrepancy indicates that the program fails to deliver the correct output according to the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.
