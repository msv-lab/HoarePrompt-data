Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of different weights of splits for a given integer \( n \). 

The algorithm in the code attempts to count divisors of \( n \), returning a count that is not related to the weights of splits as defined in the problem description. It simply adds 2 for each divisor found and subtracts 1 if \( n \) is a perfect square, which does not correspond to the number of different weights of the splits of \( n \).

For example, consider \( n = 8 \). The correct weights should include:
- Weight 1: [8]
- Weight 2: [4, 4]
- Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
- Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
- Weight 5: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 

These yield a total of 5 different weights. However, the program will produce an incorrect count for \( n = 8 \) because its logic focuses on the number of divisors rather than actually investigating the properties of the splits of \( n \).

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
