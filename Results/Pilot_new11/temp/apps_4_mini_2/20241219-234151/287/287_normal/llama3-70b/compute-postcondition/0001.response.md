The variable `res` is initialized to 0, and the value of `n` remains unchanged. There are no changes to `n` or any other variables, so the output state reflects the current state of the variables after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9; `res` is 0.**
