The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n` and `k` are not altered by the print statement. Therefore, the state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged, and the program has simply printed a message.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `k` is a positive integer equal to the input value, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`, and 'No' has been printed.**
