Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. 

1. **Checking the sum condition**: The program only checks if `n < k` at the beginning and prints "No" if true. However, this check is not sufficient. The core requirement is that the sum of the sequence needs to equal `n`. For example, if `n = 13` and `k = 2`, the output should be "No", which the program handles correctly. Nevertheless, there are other configurations where the program could falsely determine that a solution exists or it could fail to find the necessary combinations of powers that sum up to `n`.

2. **Not addressing `k` in the decomposition**: The algorithm constructs the list `a` by continually subtracting the largest power of 2 until `n` is zero or cannot subtract anymore, and then it simply trims the list to initial `k` elements. This approach does not ensure that the sequence can be completed exactly to length `k` while adhering to the sum condition. For example, the basic condition for forming the list based on having enough distinct powers of two to fill the list of length `k` with unique elements is not accounted for.

3. **Sorting**: While the program sorts the result in descending order, it does not ensure that it constructs the "lexicographically largest" sequence properly, especially when all elements could be the same or need to be split to achieve the desired length while maintaining the correct sum.

4. **Negative Powers**: The issue of negative powers is not handled properly. The code does not consider the requirement that elements may be less than zero while generating the sequence, especially to satisfy cases where `n` is small (like `n=1` and `k=2` leading to a valid output of -1, -1).

Because of these issues, there are cases where the program will either output "Yes" when it should not or fail to produce the correct and expected output according to the problem's requirements.
