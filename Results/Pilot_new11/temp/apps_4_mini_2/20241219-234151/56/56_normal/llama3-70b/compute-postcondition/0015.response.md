`x` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`, which represents the number of bits required to represent the positive integer `n` in binary, minus one. Given that `n` is a positive integer and must be less than its previous value, this operation will yield a non-negative integer value for `x` (since `n` is at least 1). The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer less than its previous value and must be greater than 0; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer less than its previous value and must be greater than 0; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1.**
