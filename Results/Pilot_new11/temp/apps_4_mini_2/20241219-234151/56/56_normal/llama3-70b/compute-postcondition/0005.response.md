The value of `i` is initialized to 0. Since this is a simple assignment and there were no previous values of `i`, this does not affect the other variables, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `k` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**.
