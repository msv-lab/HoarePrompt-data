Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `bits` is a list containing the value [60]. If `n` has the 59th bit set (i.e., `n >> 59 & 1` evaluates to true), then `bits` is updated to contain the values [60, 59].***
