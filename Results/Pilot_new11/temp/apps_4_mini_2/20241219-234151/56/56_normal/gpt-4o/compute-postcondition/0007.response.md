Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the value [60], and `i` is 60. If the condition `n >> i & 1` is true, then `bits` will contain the value [60]. There is no else part in the code.***
