The code appends the value of `i` (which is 58) to the list `bits`. Initially, `bits` contains the value [60]. After the execution of `bits.append(i)`, `bits` will now also contain the value of `i`, thus making it [60, 58]. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is [60, 58], `i` is 58**
