The value of `n` is halved using integer division. The initial state mentions that `n` is greater than 1. After executing the given code, the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50 and `n` is now `n // 2`. If `n` is originally even, then `ans` is equal to `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is originally odd, then `ans` is equal to `0 + (n // 2).**
