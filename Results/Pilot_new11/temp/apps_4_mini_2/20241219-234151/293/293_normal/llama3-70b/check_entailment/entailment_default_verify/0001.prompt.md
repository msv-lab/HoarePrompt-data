You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
def func():
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        n //= 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of nodes Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit based on the provided rules of the game. 

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the case where the input is `h = 2` and `n = 3`. According to the problem statement, Amr starting from the root (1), will attempt to move to leaf node 3 via the following path:

1. From 1, the first command is 'L', moving to node 2.
2. The next command is 'R', moving to node 3 (the exit).

According to the description, he visits the nodes 1 (the root) and 2 before reaching node 3 (the exit). Therefore, the number of visited nodes should be 2.

However, according to the provided function's logic:

- Start with `n = 3`.
- Since `n` is odd, the code executed `ans += n // 2`, which computes `3 // 2` giving `1` for `ans`.
- Then `n` becomes `1` (as `n //= 2`).
- Since `n` is now `1`, the loop terminates.

The final output is `1`, which does not match the expected output of `2`. This discrepancy shows that the program fails to account for the correct number of nodes Amr visits before he reaches the exit. Other test cases can be derived similarly to reinforce that the logic is flawed and does not adhere to the rules defined in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two positive integers `h` and `n`, where `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. It computes a value `ans` based on the value of `n` while halving `n` until it reaches 1. In each iteration of the loop, it accumulates either `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2` if `n` is odd into `ans`. The function then prints the final value of `ans`. It inherently assumes that `n` starts from a valid positive integer within the specified range and does not handle cases where input may violate the stated constraints, nor does it account for invalid or negative values for `h` or `n`. Therefore, `h` remains unchanged during execution while `n` will be reduced to 1 after the loop. In summary, the function summarizes a computed result based on the evolution of `n` and outputs that result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
