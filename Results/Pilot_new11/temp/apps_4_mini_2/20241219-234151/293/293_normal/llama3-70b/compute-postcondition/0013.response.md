The value of `n` is halved using integer division (`//= 2`). Since `n` is greater than 2, the new value of `n` will be at least 1 (given `n` must also be an integer). The states of the other variables, including `h`, `ans`, and conditions regarding their previous states, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is updated based on the previous value of `n`.**
