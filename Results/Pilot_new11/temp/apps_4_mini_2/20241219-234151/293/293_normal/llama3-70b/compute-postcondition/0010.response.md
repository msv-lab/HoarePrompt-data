The expression `ans += n // 2 - 1` means that `ans` is incremented by the result of the integer division of `n` by 2, subtracted by 1. Since `n` must be greater than 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1 (specifically, 1 for `n` equal to 3, and it will be greater as `n` increases). The output state will reflect the change in `ans`.

- The variables `h` remains unaffected as it is not involved in the computation.
- The resulting value of `ans` will be updated based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is greater than 2; `ans` is updated by adding `(n // 2 - 1)` to its previous value.**
