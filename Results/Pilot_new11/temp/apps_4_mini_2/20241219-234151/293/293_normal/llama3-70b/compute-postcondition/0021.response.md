The function `func` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h. The function does not have an explicit return statement provided in the output description. However, based on the constraints given, it can be inferred that the function is designed for some processing or operation based on the values of `h` and `n`, possibly returning a computed result or value derived from these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is a positive integer (1 ≤ h ≤ 50) and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h).**
