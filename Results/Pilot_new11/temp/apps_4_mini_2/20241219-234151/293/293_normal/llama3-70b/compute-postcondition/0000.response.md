The values of `h` and `n` are updated as they are assigned values through `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input and converts them to integers. The specific values for `h` and `n` are determined by the input given, but we know that `h` remains a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and \(2^h\). Therefore, after the execution of this code, the output state updates the values for `h` and `n` based on user input, while keeping their constraints in mind.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`**.
