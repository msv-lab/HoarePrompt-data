The value of `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `n` by 2. Given that `n` is greater than 1, `n // 2` will yield a positive integer, resulting in an increase in the value of `ans`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged based on the provided conditions. 

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2`.**
