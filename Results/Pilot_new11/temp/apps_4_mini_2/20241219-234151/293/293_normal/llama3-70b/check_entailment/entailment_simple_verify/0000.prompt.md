You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
def func():
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        n //= 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the code thoroughly.

### Problem Analysis
We need to count the number of nodes Amr visits before reaching the exit node in a binary tree of height `h`, indexed such that:
- Leaf nodes are indexed from 1 to \(2^h\).
- Amr follows a path dictated by an infinite sequence of alternating movements ('L' for left and 'R' for right).
- He skips commands when visiting a node already visited and has to move back up the tree if he skips two consecutive commands.

### Program Analysis
Here is the provided program:

```python
def func():
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        n //= 2
    print(ans)
```

1. **Variable Initialization**: 
   - Reads `h` (height) and `n` (exit node index).
   - Initializes `ans` to count the number of visited nodes.

2. **While Loop Condition**: 
   - Continues until `n` is greater than 1, which means it won't process the root node itself (node 1).

3. **Node Counting Logic**: 
   - For an even indexed node, it adds \(n // 2 - 1\) to `ans`.
   - For an odd indexed node, it adds \(n // 2\).

4. **Node Index Update**: 
   - `n` is divided by 2 in each iteration, effectively moving up to the parent of the current node.

### Potential Case Analysis
Let’s evaluate whether this program correctly counts the nodes visited:

- **Traversal Observation**:
  - The program seems to add nodes in a peculiar way. Let's manually analyze a few cases.

- **Example with h=1, n=2**:
  - Expected output is 2:
    - Visits the root (1) and then goes to leaf (2).
    - Nodes visited: [1]. Total visited before exit: 1 (not counting 2).
  
- **Example with h=2, n=3**:
  - Expected output is 5:
    - Visits nodes [1, 2, 3], meaning it visits root (1), left child (2), and right child (3).
    - Total without 3 is 2 (should be 5 but here it returns 2).

- **Example with larger input** (`h=3, n=6`):
  - Processor logic gives: Visits nodes [1] (then 3), leading to 10 which does match. However, root (1) is counted incorrectly in each case.

- **Finding a Faulty Case**:
  - For case where `h=1, n=2`, and also `h=2, n=3`. The answer should count all nodes effectively while respecting the conditions validated through skipping.

The problems with counting nodes accurately mean the program does not return expected results according to the game’s rules within the problem description. 

Given the above observations, where the program fails to accurately account for every traversal possible from root to exit, we can establish:

Correctness: **False**.  

The program miscalculates the number of visited nodes, specifically how nodes are indexed and counted up through levels of the tree.

### Conclusion
The approach taken in the code does not align with the traversal logic described and ultimately does not handle edge cases or accidental revisit correctly, leading to inaccuracies in the number of nodes visited before finding the exit.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: h is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.
def func():
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        
        n //= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 1, `ans` is the total accumulation from the original value of `n` through the loop's iterations, which adds either `n // 2 - 1` if `n` was even or `n // 2` if `n` was odd for each iteration before `n` became 1. `h` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50.
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
