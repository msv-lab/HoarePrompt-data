The variable `n` is halved using the integer division operator (`//=`). The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 1, meaning it will take a value of at least 2. The nature of the division will change the value of `n`, but does not affect `h`, `ans`, or any other variables.

After the operation `n //= 2`, the possible values of `n` will now be determined by its previous value, reducing it to half. 

Thus, if `n` was an even number greater than 1, `n` will take on values like 2, 4, 6, ... up to 50, which results in new possible values of `n` being 1 (if `n` was 2 initially) or any integer up to 25 (if it was initially 50).

Since `n` is updated but not calculated directly in the output state—the only thing that changes is the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is reduced to n // 2 which is in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 25**.
