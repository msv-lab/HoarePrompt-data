The variable `current_node` is updated with the expression `2 * current_node + 1`. The previous value of `current_node` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `direction`. Hence, if `current_node` was 1, the new value would be `2 * 1 + 1 = 3`. If `current_node` was 2, the new value would be `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`. 

Since the specific previous value of `current_node` is not known, the output state can account for both possibilities:

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and `2^h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` (must have at least 2 characters), `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is either 3 or 5.**
