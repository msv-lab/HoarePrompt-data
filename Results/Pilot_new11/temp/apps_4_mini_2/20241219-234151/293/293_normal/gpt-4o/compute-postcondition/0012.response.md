The variable `current_node` is updated according to the expression `2 * current_node + 2`. The previous value of `current_node` is 0, so the new value becomes `2 * 0 + 2`, which equals 2. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and `2^h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length `h` representing `n - 1`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2, and `direction` is not '0'.**
