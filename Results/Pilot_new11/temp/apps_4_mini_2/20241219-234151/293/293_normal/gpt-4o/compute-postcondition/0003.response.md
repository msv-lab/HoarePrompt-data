`visited_count` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so we retain their previous conditions. The valid range for `h`, `n`, and `total_leaves` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is between 1 and `2^h`; `total_leaves` is equal to `2`; `visited_count` is 0**
