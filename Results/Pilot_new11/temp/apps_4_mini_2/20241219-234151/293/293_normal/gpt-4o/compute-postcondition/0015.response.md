The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` was 2, so the new value is 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and their states still hold true. 

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and `2^h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` (must have at least 2 characters), `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is updated to either 1 or 2 based on the value of `direction`.**
