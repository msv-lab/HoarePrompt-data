To determine the correctness of the program against the provided problem description, let's analyze the implementation and logic of the function in the context of the requirements.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to modify the sides of an equilateral triangle from a length of `x` to a length of `y` with the least number of modifications. Each side must remain a positive integer, and the sides must continue to form a non-degenerate triangle throughout the process.

2. **Input Constraints**: The inputs `x` and `y` are guaranteed to satisfy `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. 

3. **Desired Output**: We need to print the minimum number of seconds (modifications) required to change the triangle from side length `x` to `y`.

4. **Examining the Program**:
   ```python
   def func():
       x, y = map(int, input().split())
       print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
   ```
   - The line `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates how many modifications are needed.
   - When `x - y` is an even number, `(x - y) // 2` gives the required number of modifications directly, as we can reduce the side length by 2 each time.
   - When `x - y` is odd, we reduce by 2 for `(x - y) // 2` modifications and need an additional +1 modification to make the final adjustment.
   
5. **Logic Verification**:
   - The maximum side length reduction in each operation can be from `x` to `y` as long as the current sides form a valid triangle. The program ensures that the triangle remains valid since it will only modify the sides downward.
   - With each modification, the triangle continues to satisfy the condition `side length > 0`.
   - The formula provides the correct calculations of seconds needed, as derived from integer division and the properties of odd vs. even differences.

6. **Conclusion**: 
   - The implementation follows the logic defined in the problem description correctly.
   - The calculated minimum number of seconds to modify the triangle meets the non-degeneration criteria while adjusting to ensure integer side lengths.

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
