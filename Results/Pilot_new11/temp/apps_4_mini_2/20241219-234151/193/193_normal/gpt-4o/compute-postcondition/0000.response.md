`x` and `y` are assigned the values from `input()`, which accepts two integers. The previous constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. After the code is executed, `x` and `y` will take the values provided by the user through input, but the constraints still apply, meaning the relationship between `x` and `y` remains valid.

Output State: **`y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ y < `input integer` (previous value of y); `x` is an integer equal to `input integer` (previous value of x) and `x` > `y`.**
