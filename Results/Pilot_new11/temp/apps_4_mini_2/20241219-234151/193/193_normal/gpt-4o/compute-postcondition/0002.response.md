The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that there are two integers, `x` and `y`, such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. The specifics regarding the output of the function based on these integers were not provided. Therefore, without further details on what the function outputs when considering these parameters, we cannot ascertain its full functionality. 

Functionality: **The function does not directly accept parameters but operates with two integers, x and y, under the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function's specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
