The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of lists, where 2 <= n <= 50. The parameter `m` is an integer representing the number of integers in each list, where 2 <= m <= 50. The parameter `A` is a list containing `n` lists, where each inner list consists of `m` integers, and each integer is either 0 or 1. 

The function has multiple cases that can all result in the same output. In all cases, if specific conditions are met, the function returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n` and `m`, and a list `A`, and return -1 based on predefined conditions that do not depend on the values of `n`, `m`, or the content of the list `A`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and A, and returns -1 under multiple conditions.**
