According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `m` is greater than 0, it also guarantees that `m` must be greater than 1 for the next iteration to proceed.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the elements A[i][j] and B[i][j] are equal.**
