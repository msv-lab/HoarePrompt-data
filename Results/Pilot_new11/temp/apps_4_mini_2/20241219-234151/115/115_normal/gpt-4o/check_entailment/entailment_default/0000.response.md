The program implements a method to transform a zero matrix `B` into matrix `A` by performing a series of operations that fill specific submatrices of `B` with ones. The operations aim to match matrix `A` exactly.

### Evaluation of the Code
1. **Main Loop Logic**: The function iterates through possible coordinates to identify 2x2 blocks of ones in matrix `A`, and whenever it finds such a block, it marks the corresponding positions in matrix `B` and records the operation.

2. **Matching Check**: After attempting to fill matrix `B`, the function checks if all elements in `A` match those in `B`. If there is any mismatch, it returns `-1`.

### Critical Examination
- The function only fills `B` in cases where it finds a complete 2x2 block of ones in `A`. If there are single 1s in `A` that aren't part of any 2x2 block, those will not be filled in `B`.
- For example, consider a case where `A` has a `1` at a boundary position (e.g., `A[1][0]` = 1, `A[0][1]` = 1), but doesn't have a full 2x2 block that includes it. The resulting matrix `B` would remain `0` at those positions, leading to a mismatch. 
- Thus, the program fails in cases where the matrix `A` requires filling `1`s that cannot form a complete 2x2 block.

### Conclusion
Based on this analysis, we can derive that the code does not handle all possible cases required by the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for isolated `1`s in matrix `A` that are not part of any complete 2x2, causing incorrect evaluations in those scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
