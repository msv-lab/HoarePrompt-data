Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged; `A` is unchanged; `B` will have elements `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` set to 1 wherever the corresponding elements in `A` satisfy the condition of being all equal to 1 for the indices accessed in the loop; `operations` contains tuples representing the 1-based indices of those updates; if no updates occur, then `B` remains unchanged for those positions and `operations` is still an empty list if no such conditions were ever met.**
