According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the elements A[i][j] and B[i][j] are equal**.
