According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `m`. Since `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, meaning that the loop executed for the first time (for `j = 0`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented. After the last iteration, `j` will be 1. In order for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the values at A[i][j] and B[i][j] are equal.**
