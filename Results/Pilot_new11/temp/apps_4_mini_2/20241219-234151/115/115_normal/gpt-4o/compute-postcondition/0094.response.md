Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `m` (an integer), and `A` (a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m integers that are either 0 or 1). It processes the input matrix `A` to create a new matrix `B` of the same dimensions, initially filled with zeros. The function searches for 2x2 blocks of ones in `A` and marks the corresponding positions in `B` as ones. It accumulates the positions of each successful block found in a list called `operations`. The function then verifies if all elements of `A` match with those in `B`. If they do not match, it immediately returns -1.

If all elements match, it prints the number of operations performed and the 1-based indices of each block found. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` are less than 2 explicitly; thus, if either is less than 2, it won't process any blocks but will still check for element equality between `A` and `B`. The final state after the program concludes is: If no blocks are found, `B` remains a zero matrix and `operations` is empty; if blocks are found, `B` will contain ones where the blocks are identified, and the operation indices will be printed accordingly, but it will still return -1 if there is any mismatch. The function effectively only returns -1 and does not return any other value, regardless of successful operations or matches.**
