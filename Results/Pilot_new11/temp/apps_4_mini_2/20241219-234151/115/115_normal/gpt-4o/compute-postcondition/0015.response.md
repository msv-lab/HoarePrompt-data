Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1, `A` is unchanged, and `operations` now includes `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `B` remains unchanged, and `A` and `operations` remain unchanged as well.***
