The code assigns the value of 1 to four specific positions in matrix `B`. The given positions are determined by the variables `i` and `j`, where `i` is equal to `n - 2` and `j` is equal to 0. The original state of `B` at these positions is not specified, but after executing the code, all four positions will be equal to 1. The states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, `A` is unchanged, `B` now has `B[n - 2][0] = 1`, `B[n - 2][1] = 1`, `B[n - 1][0] = 1`, `B[n - 1][1] = 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is 0.**
