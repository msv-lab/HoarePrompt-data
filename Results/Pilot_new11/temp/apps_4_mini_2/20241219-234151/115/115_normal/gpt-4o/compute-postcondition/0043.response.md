The statement assigns the value of `1` to four positions in a 2-dimensional list `B`. The previous values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are not specified, but they will all be updated to `1`. The initial states of `n`, `m`, and `A` are unchanged, and `j` is `2` which dictates the columns being updated in the list `B`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 3, `A` is unchanged, `j` is 2; `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1**.
