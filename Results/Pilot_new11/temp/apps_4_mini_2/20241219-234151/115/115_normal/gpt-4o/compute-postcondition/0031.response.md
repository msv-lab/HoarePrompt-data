Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, `A` is unchanged; `B` will have `B[n - 2][0]` through `B[n - 2][m - 2]` set to 1, `B[n - 1][0]` through `B[n - 1][m - 2]` set to 1 if the conditions for each relevant j across the iterations are satisfied, otherwise they remain unchanged; `i` is `n - 2`; `operations` contains tuples `(n - 1, j + 1)` for every j where the conditions have been satisfied, and is unchanged otherwise.**
