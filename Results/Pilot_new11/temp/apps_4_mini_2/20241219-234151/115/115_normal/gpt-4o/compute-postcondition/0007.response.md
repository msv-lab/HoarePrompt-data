Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a list of `n` lists each containing `m` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `operations` is updated to [(1, 1)], `B` is updated such that `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `operations` or `B`.***
