Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, and `A` is unchanged. If `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `B[n - 2][0]` through `B[n - 2][m - 2]` and `B[n - 1][0]` through `B[n - 1][m - 2]` are set to 1, `operations` now includes the tuple `(n, 1)`, and `j` remains 0. Otherwise, there are no changes to `B`, `operations`, or the values of `A` and `j`.***
