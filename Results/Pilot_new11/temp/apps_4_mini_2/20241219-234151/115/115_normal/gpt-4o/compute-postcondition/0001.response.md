The variable `B` is assigned a new list that consists of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers, all initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged and are within the specified range of 2 to 50. The list `A` remains unchanged, and `operations` also remains an empty list. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a list of `n` lists each containing `m` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a list containing `n` lists each with `m` integers equal to 0.**
