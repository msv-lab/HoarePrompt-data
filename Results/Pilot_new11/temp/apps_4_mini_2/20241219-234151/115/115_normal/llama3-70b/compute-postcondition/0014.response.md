Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. If `A[0][1]` and `A[1][1]` are both 1, and `A[0][2]` and `A[1][2]` are also both 1, then the specified conditions regarding the elements of `A` are satisfied. Otherwise, no changes are made.
```
ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
```

Now, please think step by step: If the conditions for changing `ops` are met, we will append the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, this results in adding the tuple `(1, 2)` to `ops`. The states of `n`, `m`, `A`, and the conditions remain unchanged unless they were met.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains the tuples (1, 1) and (1, 2), `i` is 0, `j` is 1** if the conditions on `A` are satisfied; otherwise, **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1**.
