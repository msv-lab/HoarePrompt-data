According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and we know that `m` is between 2 and 50, which means `m - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again. 

After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1. For the loop to execute one more time, it re-evaluates the condition `j < m - 1`, so in this case, `m` must still be at least 2, allowing `j` to be less than `m - 1`, which is still valid.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, j is 1**
