According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its last value, which is `m - 2` (since the loop goes up to `m - 1`). Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 to `m - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, A is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, j is `m - 1`, and `ops` contains the last tuple (i + 1, j + 1)**
