To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute, we must analyze the context of the `ops` list. The loop will iterate over each tuple in `ops`, and therefore `ops` needs to be non-empty for the loop to execute.

Given the provided state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`.
- `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for positions where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one valid tuple. This means that there should be at least one coordinate `(i, j)` in the 2D array `A` that satisfies the condition about the values being at least 1 as mentioned above. Given that `ops` is built from the elements of `A`, the condition for at least one operation to be valid implies that we need integers in `A` at the respective positions.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we conclude the following:
1. `ops` must not be empty.
2. There must be at least one position `(i, j)` in the 2D list `A` meeting the previously defined condition.

According to these requirements, we can summarize the necessary state adjustments as:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` must not be empty and must contain at least one valid tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
