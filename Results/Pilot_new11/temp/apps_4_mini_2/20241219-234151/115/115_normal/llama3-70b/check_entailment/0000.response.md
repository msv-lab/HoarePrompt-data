Correctness: **False**.

The program has logical flaws that make it incorrect in certain cases. For example, consider the following input case:

```
3 3
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

In this case, it is impossible to make matrix B equal to matrix A using the allowed operations, as the submatrix where B can be altered (that is, the 2x2 submatrices) cannot cover the entire area of 1s in A due to the presence of a zero at the location A[0][2] (which leaves an isolated 1 at location A[0][1]). 

However, the program would not return -1 in this situation; instead, it would proceed to add operations to transform part of B to match the 1s in A where possible, leading to an incorrect answer.

Overall, the conditions to determine whether it's possible to replicate matrix A in B based on the operations are not fully considered, thus resulting in incorrect outputs for specific scenarios.
