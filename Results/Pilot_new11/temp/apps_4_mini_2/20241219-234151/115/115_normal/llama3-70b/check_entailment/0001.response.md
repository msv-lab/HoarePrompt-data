To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Restatement:
You need to transform matrix `B`, initialized with all zeros, into matrix `A` using specific operations that involve turning a `2x2` submatrix of `B` into all `1`s. You need to make sure that the operations are feasible and cover all `1`s in `A`.

### Code Review:
Let's look at the provided code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Logic for Selecting Operations**:
   - The code only adds operations to `ops` when at least one of the positions of the current cell or its adjacent cells contains a `1`.
   - If a `2x2` block exists with all ones, it ignores this situation entirely because it uses the `continue` statement.

2. **Determination of Validity**:
   - The program generates a list of operations based on the orientation of ones in matrix `A`.
   - However, it only checks for `1`s in local groups of four cells without performing any validation on whether the operations collectively result in all `1`s in matrix `A`.

3. **Potential Failure Case**:
   - Consider the matrix `A` as follows:
     ```
     1 1
     1 0
     ```
   - The matrix is such that it is impossible to cover the bottom right position (which must remain `0`) while satisfying the other positions being `1`. However, since one of the cells (at `(1, 1)` in zero-indexing, or `(2, 2)` in one-indexing) would not trigger any additions to `ops`, the program would output that transformation is possible (`k` operations) when in reality, it is impossible.
   - In this case, the program would fail to return `-1` but would return the number of operations that do not cover the whole matrix properly.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the program incorrectly concludes that it's possible to create the desired matrix based on local checks without considering overall feasibility. As such, the correctness of the program fails with specific configurations of the matrix `A`.

Hence, the output for the correctness of the program based on its potential failure case is:

Correctness: **False**
