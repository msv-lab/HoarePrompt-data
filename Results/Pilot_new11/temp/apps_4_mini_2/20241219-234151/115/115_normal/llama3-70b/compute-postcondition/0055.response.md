The `continue` statement does not affect the values of variables directly; instead, it immediately ends the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since the current values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, the states of these variables are retained, but we note that we will continue to the next iteration of the loop they might be in. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
