The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed with the next iteration. Based on the initial state provided, there are no changes to the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `j`, and `ops` as a result of executing this code. The execution would simply move on to the next iteration of the loop without affecting any variables or their states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `j` is `m - 1`, and `ops` contains the last tuple (i + 1, j + 1)**
