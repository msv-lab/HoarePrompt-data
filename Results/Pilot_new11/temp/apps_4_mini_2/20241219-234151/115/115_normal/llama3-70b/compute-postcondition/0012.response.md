The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop (if there were one) and proceeds to the next iteration. However, since no loop context has been provided, the code effectively does nothing in the current state. 

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.**
