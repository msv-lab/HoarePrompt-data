The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The existing values for `i` and `j` are not provided in the initial state but are integers. The conditions mention that `A` has specific values, but the direct state of `i` and `j` is unknown. As such, we can conclude that after this code executes, the `ops` list will have added a new tuple that consists of incremented values of `i` and `j`. 

We know that `A` has certain integer values at specific positions and that the conditions regarding `A` are satisfied, but there are no updates to `A`, `n`, or `m`, and since the values of `i` and `j` are not defined in the state, we cannot specify their values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
