Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if matrix `B` can be made equal to matrix `A`. The criteria for selecting submatrices are flawed. The mistakes include:

1. The program considers adding a submatrix operation if any element in the 2x2 region contains a `1`, which does not ensure that the necessary 2x2 block of `1s` exists in `A` where the operation can be applied. Thus, there could be scenarios where it prematurely calls for an operation without ensuring that all four required elements are `1`.

2. The logic fails to account for situations where `A` might not be fully covered by operations. For instance, if there are isolated `1s` in `A` that cannot be addressed by any 2x2 operations, it will incorrectly assume those can be transformed into `1s` by merely attempting to form any operations based on partial `1s`.

To illustrate this with a specific example: 

For the input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The expectation is the output should be `-1` because it is impossible to cover all necessary positions with the available operations, yet the current implementation would not handle such cases correctly.

Therefore, since the program does not handle cases where the operations cannot adequately transform `B` into `A` after applying the given operations, the overall correctness of the implementation is `False`.
