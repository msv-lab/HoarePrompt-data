The code snippet prints the values contained in the tuple `op`, specifically accessing its first and second elements. Since `op` is defined as the second tuple in the list `ops`, the values printed will be those specific to `op`.

The initial variables remain unaffected, except for the printed output, which represents the first two elements of `op`. 

Therefore, the Output State will include all the information from the initial state while specifically mentioning the printed values derived from the tuple `op`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, `ops` contains at least one more valid tuple, and the printed output is `op[0], op[1]`.**
