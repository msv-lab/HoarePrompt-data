To determine whether the `while` loop will execute one more time, we need to analyze the relationship between the variables `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `i * i <= x`. 

1. Currently, `i` is 11. Therefore, \( i * i = 11 * 11 = 121 \).
2. The condition for the loop to execute is that \( 121 \leq x \).
3. We know that `x` must be at least 25, but currently, we need `x` to be at least 121 for the loop to execute again.
4. Thus, we need to adjust `x` to be at least 121.

No other states need to be adjusted since `i` remains unchanged and all other conditions on `x` (not being divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7) do not affect the loop iteration condition.

State: **`x` must be at least 121 and `x` must be at least 25 and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3 and `x` is not divisible by 5 and is not divisible by 7; `i` is 11**
