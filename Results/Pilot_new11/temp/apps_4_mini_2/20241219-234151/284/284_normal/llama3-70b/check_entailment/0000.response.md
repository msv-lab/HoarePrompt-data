To analyze the provided program, we need to check if it properly finds a counterexample `m` such that `n * m + 1` results in a non-prime number for the input `n`.

### Examination of the Code:

1. The first part of the program reads an integer input `n`.
2. It then runs a loop for `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1`.
4. It calls `func_1()` to check if this computed value is not a prime number.
5. If it finds a non-prime, it prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

### Observation of the Prime Checking Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the prime-checking algorithm. It returns `False` for any number less than 2, and for numbers greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of `num`, which is sufficient to determine if `num` is prime.

### Analysis of Problem Requirements:
1. The problem states that a proper input value `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) must lead to finding at least one valid `m` such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`.
2. The code is structured to loop through possible values of `m` and would logically find an `m` for which `n * m + 1` is non-prime before reaching `m = 1000`.

### Potential Issues:
1. The prime-checking function will effectively find any non-prime value, but since the problem guarantees that there exists such an `m`, it is crucial that:
   - The loop must find at least one non-prime within the range of `m` as specified.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program code is structured correctly to find a valid `m`, which satisfies the problem's requirements. There are no apparent edge cases that the code does not handle because:
- The loop begins at `m = 1` and efficiently checks all possible values up to 1000.
- The prime-checking function is comprehensive and correctly identifies non-prime values.

Therefore, we conclude that the program functions as intended.

Correctness: **True**.
