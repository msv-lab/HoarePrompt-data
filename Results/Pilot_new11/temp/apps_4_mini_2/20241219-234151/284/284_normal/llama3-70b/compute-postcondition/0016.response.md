Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range of 1 to 1000. It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, as these values are not considered prime. Additionally, the function checks divisibility of `num` by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is found to be divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not prime. If `num` passes all checks, the function returns `True`, confirming that `num` is a prime number. However, the function lacks explicit handling for even numbers greater than 2, which are automatically not prime, meaning the returned value for such cases is left unspecified. In summary, the function effectively identifies if `num` is a prime number but does not account for all even numbers greater than 2 distinctly.**
