#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000.
def func_1(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False since the current value of `num` is less than 2, which does not satisfy the condition for being a positive integer in the specified range.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *num is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000, and num is greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, and `num` is a prime number, meaning it is not divisible by any integer `i` where 2 ≤ `i` ≤ √`num`. If `num` is less than 4, it is not prime.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that `num` is a prime number within the range of 2 to 1000, and it meets the criteria of not being divisible by any integer `i` where 2 ≤ `i` ≤ √`num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range of 1 to 1000. It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, as these values are not considered prime. Additionally, the function checks divisibility of `num` by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is found to be divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not prime. If `num` passes all checks, the function returns `True`, confirming that `num` is a prime number. However, the function lacks explicit handling for even numbers greater than 2, which are automatically not prime, meaning the returned value for such cases is left unspecified. In summary, the function effectively identifies if `num` is a prime number but does not account for all even numbers greater than 2 distinctly.
