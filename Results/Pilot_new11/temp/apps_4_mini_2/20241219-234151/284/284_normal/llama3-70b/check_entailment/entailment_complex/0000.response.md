The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality based on the provided annotations and the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a positive integer `n` which lies within the range of 1 to 1000, as guaranteed by the input constraints.

2. **Main Logic**: The program iterates through integers `m` from 1 to 1000:
   - It calculates the expression `n * m + 1`.
   - It checks if this result is a prime number by calling the function `func_1`.

3. **Prime Checking**: The function `func_1` determines if a number is prime:
   - It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 (correctly ignoring them as they are not prime).
   - It checks the divisibility of the number by all integers from 2 up to the square root of that number, returning `False` if it finds a divisor, confirming that the number is not prime.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.

4. **Counterexample Search**: The program is guaranteed to find at least one integer `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not prime, as stated in the problem description. This means it will print an integer `m` before breaking the loop as soon as it finds the first non-prime result.

### Example Execution Breakdown
- For an input of `n = 4`, when `m = 2`, the calculation becomes `4 * 2 + 1 = 9`, which is indeed not prime (divisible by 3). The program will output `2`.
- For an input of `n = 3`, when `m = 1`, the calculation becomes `3 * 1 + 1 = 4`, which is also not prime (divisible by 2). The program will output `1`.

### Correctness Verification
The program adheres to the specified behavior of outputting an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime by:
- Validating if `n*m + 1` results in a non-prime number through a rigorous prime-checking method.
- Ensuring at least one counterexample will exist within the bounds specified (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

### Conclusion
Since the program consistently meets the problem requirements and there are no paths where it fails to find a suitable `m`, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
