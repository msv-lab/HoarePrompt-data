Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `current_lcm` is updated to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is set to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate` with `new_a` being `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `new_b` being `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.***
