The variable `min_lcm` is initialized to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). The values of `a`, `b`, and `diff` remain unchanged as this line only reassigns the value of `min_lcm`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is equal to positive infinity (float('inf')).**
