Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`, `k` is greater than int(math.sqrt(diff)), `diff` is the positive integer calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b). The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
