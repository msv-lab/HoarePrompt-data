Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is greater than 0, `int(math.sqrt(diff))` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, indicating that `current_lcm` now holds this new calculated value.**
