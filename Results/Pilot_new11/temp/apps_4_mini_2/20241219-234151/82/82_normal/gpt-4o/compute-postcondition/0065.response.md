Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers and not equal to each other. `diff` is greater than 0, and `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, where `k` is a positive integer. The `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, while `new_a` and `new_b` are the nearest multiples of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. After executing the program fragment, if the `current_lcm` calculated by `func_2(new_a, new_b)` is less than `min_lcm`, or equal to `min_lcm` with `candidate` being less than `min_k`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
