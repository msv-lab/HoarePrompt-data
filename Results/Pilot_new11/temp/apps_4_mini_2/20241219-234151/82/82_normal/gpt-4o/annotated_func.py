#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y <= 10^9) and computes their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After the termination of the loop, `y` will be 0, and the function returns `x`, which will be the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function will effectively handle all cases where `y` is greater than zero and will return accurate results for the given constraints. It should be noted that the function does not explicitly handle incorrect inputs (like non-positive integers), but this is implicitly covered by the problem's constraints.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^9 and 1 <= y <= 10^9.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of x multiplied by y divided by the return value of func_1(x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, x and y, within the range of 1 to 1 billion. It calculates the product of x and y and then divides this product by the result of another function, func_1(x, y). The function ultimately returns this computed value. Note that the behavior of the function is dependent on the implementation of func_1, which is not provided, and that there are no checks for the specific value that func_1 returns (including cases where func_1(x, y) may equal zero), which could lead to a division by zero error. Therefore, while the function is designed to perform the division operation as stated, the lack of safeguards related to the output of func_1 could manifest as potential edge cases in real usage scenarios.

def func_3(a, b):

        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate

                    min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`. `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`. `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found among the generated candidates from the divisors of `diff`, and `min_k` is the candidate that produced this minimum least common multiple. If no valid candidates were found, `min_lcm` remains positive infinity and `min_k` is 0.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k which is the candidate that produced the minimum least common multiple found among the generated candidates from the divisors of diff, where diff is equal to abs(a - b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). If `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns `0`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`, and identifies candidates from the divisors of `diff`. It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of modified versions of `a` and `b` based on these candidates. The function returns `min_k`, which represents the candidate divisor that resulted in the minimum LCM among all evaluated candidates. If no valid candidates were found, `min_k` remains `0` (the initial value), as the logic does not explicitly handle scenarios where no valid candidates yield a defined LCM. Thus, the function efficiently finds a divisor that minimizes the LCM of the adjusted values of `a` and `b` based on their difference.
