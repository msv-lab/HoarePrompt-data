The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The other variables, including `a`, `b`, `diff`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and `candidate`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the relevant information about the variables is still valid after executing the code.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer; `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
