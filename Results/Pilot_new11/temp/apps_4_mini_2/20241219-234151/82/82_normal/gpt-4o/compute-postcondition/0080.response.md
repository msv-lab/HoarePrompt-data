To assess the overall output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the following aspects based on the structure of the loop:

1. **Initial Variables**: We know `a` and `b` are positive integers, and they are not equal. Since `diff` must be greater than 0 and the square root condition holds, we start with a valid configuration for the loop execution.
2. **Loop Candidates**: The loop iterates over two candidates: `k` and `diff // k`. The calculations for `new_a` and `new_b` yield the nearest multiples of the current candidate, ensuring they are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively.
3. **LCM Calculation**: The `current_lcm` is determined by the results of the function `func_2` applied to `new_a` and `new_b`. The loop updates `min_lcm` and `min_k` based on the computed `current_lcm`.

After all iterations of the loop:
- Both candidates have been evaluated.
- The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are based on the largest candidate chosen during the loop iterations.
- The minimum LCM observed during these evaluations is stored in `min_lcm`, and the corresponding candidate that produced this LCM is stored in `min_k`.

If the loop executes a minimum of one time, we conclude:
- `min_lcm` is the smallest least common multiple of the computed multiples of `new_a` and `new_b`.
- `min_k` reflects the candidate that resulted in this minimum LCM.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` based on the evaluated candidates; `min_k` is the candidate corresponding to `min_lcm`.**
