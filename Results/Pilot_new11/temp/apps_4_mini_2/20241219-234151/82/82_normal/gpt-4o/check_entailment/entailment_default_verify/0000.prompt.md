You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the program against the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it accounts for all potential cases for finding the smallest non-negative integer \(k\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a+k\) and \(b+k\) is minimized.

### Review of the Provided Code:
1. **Helper Function `func_1`:** This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Helper Function `func_2`:** This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the relation \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. **Main Function `func_3`:** 
   - It checks if \(a\) is equal to \(b\). In this case, it returns \(0\) since the LCM of the same number with itself is the number itself.
   - It calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
   - It searches for factors \(k\) from \(1\) to \(\sqrt{\text{diff}}\).
   - For each factor, it computes the potential values of \(a+k\) and \(b+k\), and finds the minimal LCM for those transformed numbers.
   - The goal is to find the optimal value of \(k\) that minimizes the LCM.

### Potential Case for Failure:
While reviewing the conditions in the main function, it only considers values of \(k\) starting from \(1\) to \(\sqrt{\text{diff}}\). However, there may be cases where \(k=0\) yields the optimal LCM but is not being checked.

**Example Case to Consider:**
- Let \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\).
- For \(k = 0\):
  - LCM(2+0, 4+0) = LCM(2, 4) = 4.
- For \(k = 1\):
  - LCM(2+1, 4+1) = LCM(3, 5) = 15.
- For \(k = 2\):
  - LCM(2+2, 4+2) = LCM(4, 6) = 12.
- For \(k = 3\):
  - LCM(2+3, 4+3) = LCM(5, 7) = 35.

From these evaluations, we can see that when \(k = 0\), the minimum LCM is achieved. Hence, the program misses the case where \(k = 0\) is optimal.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to consider the possibility of the optimal value being \(k = 0\) for any values \(a\) and \(b\) where their immediate LCM when \(k = 0\) is less than or equal to any LCM calculated for \(k \ge 1\).

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). If `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns `0`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`, and identifies candidates from the divisors of `diff`. It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of modified versions of `a` and `b` based on these candidates. The function returns `min_k`, which represents the candidate divisor that resulted in the minimum LCM among all evaluated candidates. If no valid candidates were found, `min_k` remains `0` (the initial value), as the logic does not explicitly handle scenarios where no valid candidates yield a defined LCM. Thus, the function efficiently finds a divisor that minimizes the LCM of the adjusted values of `a` and `b` based on their difference.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
