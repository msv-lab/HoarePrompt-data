According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the relationship between `k` and `diff`. The loop will run for each integer `k` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. After executing the last iteration, `k` would be equal to the largest integer within this range, which is `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, thus it would become `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`. However, we must ensure that this value is still within the range of valid values for `k`. Since the loop condition is `k` being less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, for the loop to execute again, `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1` must still satisfy `k <= int(math.sqrt(diff))`. 

Therefore, it is impossible for `k` to exceed `int(math.sqrt(diff))` in order for the loop to run again. This means that the next state must acknowledge that the loop can no longer continue. 

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, and k is greater than int(math.sqrt(diff))**.
