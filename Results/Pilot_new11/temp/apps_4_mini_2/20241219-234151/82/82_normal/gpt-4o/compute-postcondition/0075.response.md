In the provided code snippet, the variable `new_b` is assigned a new value based on the calculation involving `b` and `candidate`. The existing condition indicates that `candidate` is `diff // k`, which is a positive integer since `diff` is greater than 0 and `k` is positive. Consequently, `new_b` will be recalculated and its new value will be determined based on the formula provided:

```
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

Since `b` is a positive integer and `candidate` is also positive, the expression `(b + candidate - 1)` is definitely positive, and the result of the integer division followed by multiplying by `candidate` will yield a new value for `new_b`, but since the exact values of `b` and `candidate` are not provided, we will express `new_b` as dependent on `b` and `candidate`.

After executing the code, the updated variable is as follows:

- `new_b` is now equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

All other variables retain their previous values.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b`.**
