The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y <= 10^9) and computes their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After the termination of the loop, `y` will be 0, and the function returns `x`, which will be the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function will effectively handle all cases where `y` is greater than zero and will return accurate results for the given constraints. It should be noted that the function does not explicitly handle incorrect inputs (like non-positive integers), but this is implicitly covered by the problem's constraints.
