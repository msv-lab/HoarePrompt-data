The code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. As `candidate` is already defined as `diff // k`, the value of `min_k` will match that of `candidate`. There are no changes to the other variables (`a`, `b`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`). 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`**.
