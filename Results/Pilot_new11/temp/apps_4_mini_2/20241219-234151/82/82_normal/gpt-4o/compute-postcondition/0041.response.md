According to the code, the loop iterates over a list containing the values `[k, diff // k]`. The variable `candidate` takes on the values of this list in sequence, which means the loop will execute for both `k` and `diff // k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` would have taken on the first value from the list, which is `k`. To execute the loop one more time, `candidate` needs to take the second value, which is `diff // k`. 

The loop will continue if there are still values in the list to iterate over. The conditions mentioned about updating `min_lcm` and `min_k` are based on the state of `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `candidate`, but since these involve comparisons that do not affect the loop iteration itself, we simply need to adjust the value of `candidate` for the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `candidate` must be `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers with `a` not equal to `b`, candidate is `diff // k`**
