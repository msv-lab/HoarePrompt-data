The value of `new_b` is assigned the result of the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Here, `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`, and `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`. The value of `new_b` is calculated based on the existing value of `b` and `candidate`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
