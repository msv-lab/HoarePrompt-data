Correctness: **False**.

The provided program only includes functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) but does not include the logic needed to determine the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). Without implementing this crucial part of the solution, the program fails to solve the problem as described. For example, if \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \), the program does not calculate \( k = 2 \) correctly, as required by the problem. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
