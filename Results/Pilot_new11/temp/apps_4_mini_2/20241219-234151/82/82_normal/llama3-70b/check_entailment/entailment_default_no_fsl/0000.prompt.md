You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Functions with output description for each function:
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, representing two numbers in the range [1, 10^9]. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function utilizes a loop that repeatedly assigns the values of `b` and `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. After the loop, it returns `a`, which by that point holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is 0 (though constraints specify they are at least 1), the function would still handle it correctly since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. There are no additional checks for edge cases beyond the given constraints, but the function assumes valid input as specified.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are constrained by the condition that they must be at least 1 and at most 10^9. It returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b`, then dividing that product by the result of another function, `func_1`, applied to the same parameters `a` and `b`. It is assumed that `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero integer to avoid division by zero; however, the code does not explicitly handle the case where `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, which could lead to a runtime error. Therefore, the function may encounter an error in such a scenario, indicating that the final state of the program could be an error state if `func_1` returns zero. If `func_1` does not return zero, the function performs the multiplication and division as described and returns the resultant value.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
