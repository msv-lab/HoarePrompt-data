To evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze what the program is intended to do.

The task requires finding a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The program defines two functions: `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and `func_2` to compute the LCM using these two values.

However, the current implementation does not include the necessary logic to iterate over possible values of \( k \) in order to find the optimal one that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). The functions for GCD and LCM are useful, but without calling them in a loop that checks all values of \( k \), the program will not fulfill the problem requirements as stated.

### Examination:
1. The program lacks a main function or procedural logic to search through potential values of \( k \).
2. It does not return or print any value that indicates the minimal \( k \) found.
3. There is no mechanism to compare multiple values of \( k \) to find the smallest one that yields the minimum LCM.

### Example Case Analysis:
Let's consider the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \):
- The expected output is \( k = 2 \) because:
    \( \text{LCM}(6 + 2, 10 + 2) = \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \)

Let's test this:
- If we use \( k = 0 \): \( \text{LCM}(6, 10) = 30 \)
- If we use \( k = 1 \): \( \text{LCM}(7, 11) = 77 \)
- If we use \( k = 2 \): \( \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \) (minimum)
- Continuing to \( k = 3 \), \( k = 4 \), and so on will yield larger values.

Thus the minimal k and LCM is found when \( k = 2 \).

However, since the program does not have the logic to perform this search:
- It will not output anything.
- It will not find the optimal \( k \).
- Therefore, it will not meet specifications given in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to fulfill the task because it does not incorporate the mechanism to evaluate \( k \) increments and compute LCMs. Hence, even though the individual functions work fine, without a driver for these functions to achieve the final result requested, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
