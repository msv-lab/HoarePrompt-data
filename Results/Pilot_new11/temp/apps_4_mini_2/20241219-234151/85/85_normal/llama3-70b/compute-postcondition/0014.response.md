The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. Therefore, there are no input parameters to describe. However, based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function operates under the condition where `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^9. 

Since the function does not have an output specified in the information provided, we cannot determine the return value based solely on the details given.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, but it operates under the constraint that n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The specific return value is not provided.**
