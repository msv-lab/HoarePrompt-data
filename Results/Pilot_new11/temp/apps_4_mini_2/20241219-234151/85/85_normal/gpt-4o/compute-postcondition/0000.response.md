The value of `n` is reassigned from an integer within the range of 2 to 10^9 to a new integer value based on `input()`, which means `n` can now take any integer value specified by user input within the same range. The previous conditions on `n` still hold true, but its specific value is now unknown. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(input())` with 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.**
