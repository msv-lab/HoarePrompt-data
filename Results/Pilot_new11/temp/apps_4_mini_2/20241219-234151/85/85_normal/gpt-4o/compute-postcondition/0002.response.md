According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. For this condition to be true, `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10, which means that `n` must be such that `(n + 1)` ends with a 0. Thus, this condition simplifies to `n` being equal to 9, or any number ending in 9 (e.g., 19, 29, etc.) up to 10^9. 

Given the constraints, `n` is an integer with values ranging from 2 to 10^9. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 9 to satisfy the condition for the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be 9 or greater, `max_9s` is 0**
