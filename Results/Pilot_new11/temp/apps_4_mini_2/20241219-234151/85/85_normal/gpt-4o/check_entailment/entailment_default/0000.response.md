The provided program aims to compute the total number of pairs of shovels such that their combined cost ends with the maximum number of trailing nines. 

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)
```

### Output Hints Analysis:
According to the output hints, the function calculates the number of trailing 9s in `n`. It updates `max_9s` based on how many times `n + 1` can be cleanly divided by `10` (which would count the zeros from the perspective of trailing nines). The issue arises because the while loop effectively transforms `n` to `0`, which then results in a final output of `0` since the product `(n + 1) * max_9s` evaluates to `0` when `n` is `0` (regardless of `max_9s`).

### Problem Description Review:
The problem description specifies a need to count pairs of shovels such that the sum of their costs ends with the maximum number of trailing 9s. The current logic in the code does not directly correlate to calculating the correct number of valid pairs as required by the problem description.

### Example Cases:
- If `n = 7`, the expected output is `3` (as there are pairs with sums that end in one 9).
- If `n = 14`, the expected output is `9`.
- If `n = 50`, the expected output is `1`.

From our examination:
- The function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the count of pairs leading to sums that have trailing nines. The method being used will always yield `0` when the pairs' calculations are performed after the loop, as the manipulation of `n` effectively renders it useless after the computation of `max_9s`.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and fails to provide correct outputs given various values of `n`. Since there exists a case (i.e., any value of `n` that does not result in cycling the counts of nines) that leads to it outputting `0`, we conclude the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
