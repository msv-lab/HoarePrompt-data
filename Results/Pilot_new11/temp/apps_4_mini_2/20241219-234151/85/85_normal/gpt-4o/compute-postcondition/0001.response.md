`max_9s` is assigned the value `0`, but since there is no specific condition or calculation affecting the state of `n`, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected either. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to `int(input())` with 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 0.
