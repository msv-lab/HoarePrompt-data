Correctness: **False**

The provided code logic does not correctly calculate `f(i)` for all potential cases. A specific counterexample to illustrate this is the case where `m = 6`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`. 

According to the problem description:

- The frog begins at position 0 and can jump by `a` or subtract `b`.
- Specifically for this case, the frog can jump to positions:

  - From `0`: can jump to `4` (0 + 4) 
  - Cannot backtrack since 0 - b (5) is negative, jumps are limited in this regard.
  - Thus from `4`: it cannot jump to `9` but can reach `0, 4`.

- Eventually, `f(0) = 1; f(1) = 1; f(2) = 1; f(3) = 1; f(4) = 2; f(5) = 2; f(6) = 2`, but the function claims there are more reachable integers, resulting in incorrect output for this case.
  
The output hint for the second function also indicates summation over positions resulting from `k` which appears to have improper bounds and incorrect assumptions about jumps. Since for `m = 6`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`, the output should be 10, indicating there is a problem with summation and reachable calculations.

Thus, the implementation does not meet all the requirements of the problem, leading to the conclusion that the functionality is not correct for all inputs and ranges.
