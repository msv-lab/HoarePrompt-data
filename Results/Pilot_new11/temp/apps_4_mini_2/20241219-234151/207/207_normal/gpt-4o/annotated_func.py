#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer and y is a positive integer.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the initial values of `x` (which is the GCD of itself and `y` being 0) and `y` (0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The calculation is performed using the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeatedly replacing `x` and `y` with `y` and `x % y`, respectively, until `y` becomes 0. The final returned value of `x` is effectively the GCD of the initial inputs. The function does not handle the scenario where either `x` or `y` is zero or negative, which could lead to undefined behavior or exceptions if such inputs are provided. Therefore, it is assumed that valid positive integers are always supplied.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 called with arguments m // g, a // g, and b // g, multiplied by g, where g is the value returned by func_1(a, b) and is not equal to 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`, and `g` is equal to 1.
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the sum of the first m positive integers, which is calculated as (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2 based on the given condition that the current value of m is less than k, where k is equal to a + b - 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^9; `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^5; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^5; `g` is equal to 1; `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`; and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns the sum of sum_k and sum_m, where sum_k is equal to (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 and sum_m is equal to m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a positive integer, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers. It performs the following operations based on the relations between these inputs: 

1. It first computes the value `g` as the output of `func_1(a, b)`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with new parameters `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, returning the product of this recursive call and `g`.

2. If `g` equals 1, it sets `k` as `a + b - 1`. The function then checks if `m` is less than `k`. If `m` is less than `k`, it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers computed using the formula `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`.

3. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates `sum_k` and `sum_m`, where `sum_k` is the sum of the first `k` integers and `sum_m` is the sum of integers from `k` to `m`. It returns the sum of these two calculated values.

This function effectively computes specific summations based on the integer inputs while also handling a recursion case based on the output from `func_1`, which is crucial for deriving `g`. Edge cases such as when `m` is less than `k` are explicitly handled, and the recursive nature of the function ensures it can deal with larger values of `m`, `a`, and `b` in inputs while ultimately returning numerical sums tailored to the given conditions.
