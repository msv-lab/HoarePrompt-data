The provided program attempts to calculate the total number of distinct positions the frog can reach on a number line using the jump operation defined in the problem description. While the intent of the program is clear, there are significant issues with the implementation.

1. **Memory Issues**: The program initializes a list `dp` of size `m + 1`. Given the constraints, if `m` is close to \(10^9\), this results in a memory allocation that can exceed the available memory for typical execution environments. This alone makes the program impractical for large input values.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The program is designed to keep track of the number of ways to reach each position in `dp`, but the logic does not correctly calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach. It seems to mix up counting reachable ways versus reachable positions. The program should calculate how many distinct positions can be reached, rather than how many ways to reach each position.

3. **Failure to Handle Edge Cases**: For certain inputs like when `m` is much smaller than `a` or `b`, or when `b` is greater than `m`, the program may yield incorrect results because the updates to `dp` are reliant on complex interactions of addition and subtraction, without proper checks on the range of `m`.

4. **Assumption Misalignment**: The program does not take into account that the sum must be derived solely from reachable integers in the defined interval. The cumulative sum of `dp` does not reflect `f(i)` accurately due to a flawed approach in building the `dp` list.

5. **Example Verification**: For example, consider the inputs `7 5 3`. The correct expected outputs were demonstrated in the problem statement (f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, ..., f(7) = 8 leading to a sum of 19). However, the logic in the program does not guarantee it will produce this output given the reasoning behind how it constructs `dp`.

Thus, due to the flawed logic, high memory requirement, and failure to handle all potential edge cases properly, the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements in every case.

Correctness: **False**.
