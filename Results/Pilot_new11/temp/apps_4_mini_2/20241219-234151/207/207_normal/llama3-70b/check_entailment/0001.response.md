To assess the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to understand how the function `func` computes the values based on the frog's jumping capabilities.

### Review of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `dp` of size `m + 1` to store intermediate results, where `dp[i]` presumably counts the possible states the frog can reach (this is unclear since it's iterated differently in the looping).
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - The first loop goes through `0` to `m`.
   - It attempts to mark positions reachable by the frog if it jumps forward `a` steps, by adding `dp[i]` to `dp[i + a]`.
   - It also attempts to mark positions reachable by jumping backward `b` steps, but the backward jump logic appears to be incorrectly implemented. Specifically, it adds `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]`, which does not align with how jump counts should propagate.

3. **Summation**: Finally, it sums all reachable positions counted in `dp`. 

### Flaws in Implementation:
- **Backward Jump Logic**: The expression `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` does not seem logical. If we're at position `i`, then jumping backward `b` should count towards positions already known, rather than incrementing `dp[i]` itself, which could lead to erroneous counts.
  
- **Boundary Cases**: There might be boundary cases where if `m` is large and `b` is small or large where this dynamic propagation fails to count the correct jump combinations effectively.

### Example Test Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Letâ€™s consider a simple test case where we apply `m = 5`, `a = 1`, and `b = 5`. 

1. For `f(0)`, the frog can only be at `0`, which is count `1`.
2. For `f(1)`, the frog can move to `1` (count `2`).
3. Up to `f(5)`, due to the incorrect calculation of positional jumps based on `b` and the way states are updated in `dp`, we won't reach some integers correctly.

From this example, we can see how the counts do not adhere to the defined operation based on the jumps in the problem, especially for small values where the backward jump would actually encapsulate additional states within the boundary `0` to `m`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of correctness in dynamic updates within the program and potential mishandling of the backward jump propagation, we can infer that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement effectively. 

Thus, the verdict on this program's correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
