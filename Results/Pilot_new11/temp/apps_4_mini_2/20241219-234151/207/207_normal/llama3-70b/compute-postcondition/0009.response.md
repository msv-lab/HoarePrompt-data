Postcondition: ***`m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), and \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\). If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + dp[i - b]` where `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`. If `i - b` is less than 0, no modifications are made to the list `dp`.***
