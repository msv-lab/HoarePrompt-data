The variable `s` is assigned a new value from `input()`, which is a string that the user provides. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The output state needs to indicate that `s` now holds the user-provided string, while `n` and `k` retain their previous integer values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of user input.**
