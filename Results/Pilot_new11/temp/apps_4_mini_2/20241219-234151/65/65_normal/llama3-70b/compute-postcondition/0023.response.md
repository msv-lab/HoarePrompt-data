Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique characters in `s` and values represent their counts in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum value of the counts in `color_count`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if `max_color_count` is greater than `k`, 'NO' has been printed.***
