#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters from the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique characters in `s` and values represent their counts in `s`. If `s` is empty, `color_count` remains an empty dictionary.
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if (max_color_count <= k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique characters in `s` and values represent their counts in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum value of the counts in `color_count`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if `max_color_count` is greater than `k`, 'NO' has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, n and k, followed by a string s of length n, which represents colors of balloons. It counts the occurrences of each unique color in the string using a dictionary. After processing, it determines the maximum count of any balloon color. If this maximum count is less than or equal to k, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Note that if the string s is empty (although this case beyond given constraints of n ≥ 1), the function would still execute, leading to a potential problem when trying to retrieve the maximum value from the empty dictionary, resulting in a runtime error. Thus, while the function aims to check balloon color constraints against k, it lacks handling for cases where the input string might not meet the expected length.
