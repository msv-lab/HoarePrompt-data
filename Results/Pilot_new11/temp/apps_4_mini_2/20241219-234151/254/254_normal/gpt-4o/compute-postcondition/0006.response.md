The code does not change any variable values as it merely executes a print statement. It outputs the string 'NO'. The states of the variables `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `gcd_k1_k2`, and `gcd_all` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`; `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`; `gcd_all` is greater than 1. The output is 'NO'.**
