The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. 

**Reasoning:**

1. The problem specifically asks us to determine if it is possible to switch on the three garlands at moments `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of these moments. 

2. The only restriction is that the lit times of the garlands depend on their respective intervals, `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. The program uses the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these intervals as a way to determine if it's possible to cover all times after a certain point. 

3. However, the logic used in the program is flawed:
   - The GCD of the intervals signifies the largest time unit where all intervals will align (i.e., at multiples of the GCD). If the GCD is greater than 1, there will be gaps every GCD seconds where no garland is lit, which means there will be seconds after the maximum switch-on time that are not covered by the garlands.
   - Conversely, if the GCD is 1, it implies that all integers can be generated by combinations of these intervals. However, this doesn't consider specific arrangements of when the garlands should be switched on. The program's check for GCD being 1 does not guarantee coverage of every second as required by the problem.

4. Specific Counterexample: 
   - For input `4 2 3`, the GCD would yield 1. While the program would print "YES", we can find out there are still seconds (like in the case of seconds 1 and 2 right after switching on) where no garland would be lit. 

In conclusion, because the program checks only the GCD and doesn't correctly implement the needed logic to ensure that every second after the maximum switch-on time has at least one garland lit, it fails to satisfy the requirements of the problem. 

Correctness: **False**
