Functionality: **The function reads three integers (k1, k2, k3) from input, each ranging from 1 to 1500. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of k1 and k2, and then calculates the GCD of that result with k3. If the final GCD (gcd_all) is equal to 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that the three numbers are coprime. If gcd_all is greater than 1, it prints 'NO', indicating that there exists a common divisor greater than 1 among the three numbers. The function does not return any values directly. The program effectively checks for coprimality of the three input integers.**
