The given program is designed to determine whether it's possible for Mishka to switch on three garlands in such a way that at least one garland is lit during each second after the maximum time of switching.

Explanation of the program:
1. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals (k1, k2, k3).
2. If the GCD is equal to 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that the three time intervals can cover all seconds after a certain point. If the GCD is greater than 1, it prints 'NO', indicating there will be some seconds when no garland is lit.

Let's analyze against the problem description and check if it handles all potential cases correctly:

- The program essentially checks if the three intervals k1, k2, and k3 are coprime. If they are coprime, it ensures that there will be a time when every second is covered by at least one garland. 
- The provided examples in the problem support this interpretation. For example:
  - With input `2 2 3`, these garland intervals can effectively cover all seconds after the 2nd second as demonstrated, leading to output 'YES'.
  - With input `4 2 3`, the GCD is not 1 (GCD=1 is false for numbers 4 and 2), which means they can't cover every second, leading to output 'NO'.

However, there is an error in the logic for determining if it's possible to have each second lit. The GCD check might give the wrong impression:
- For intervals like `2 2 3` outputting 'YES' means that at least one interval will be lit at each second, but this is obtained without clearly ensuring all gaps can be filled appropriately with various intervals.

Case to consider:
- If all garlands have the same interval and one of them is non-coprime with the others (like `2 2 2`), the GCD will be 2, leading to 'NO', incorrectly suggesting there will be blank seconds. But in this case, every second can still only be lit with the same period.

Thus, the use of GCD in this way doesn't accurately match the problem requirement for overall coverage ensuring every second is touched.

Given this reasoning, despite many cases working correctly, the reliance on the GCD leads to situations where the condition of the problem is not met universally.

Correctness: **False**.
