The variable `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The value of `prev_pos` was previously updated to 2, so it remains 2 after the assignment. The states of the other variables are not affected, so they remain the same. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `prev_pos` equals `i`, both equal to 2, while the other variables stay unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is 2, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum value between `max_jump` and 0.**
