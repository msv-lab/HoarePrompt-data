In this code snippet, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the distance from the last found vowel (at index `prev_pos`) to the end of the string `s` (which is `len(s)`). Therefore, it will become the greater value between `max_jump` and the calculated distance. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `max_jump` is the maximum distance between consecutive vowels or 1 if no vowels are present.
- `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found or -1 if no vowels exist.

The calculation updates `max_jump` as follows:
- `len(s) - prev_pos` computes the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
- If no vowels exist, `prev_pos` is -1, and thus `len(s) - prev_pos` becomes `len(s) + 1`, which will definitely be a larger value than a maximum possible `max_jump`. 
- If one or more vowels exist, `prev_pos` gives the index position of the last found vowel and allows `max_jump` to either keep its previous value or update based on the distance to the end.

The overall impact involves calculating the new maximum jump distance based on the vowels found in the string.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`, `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found or -1 if no vowels exist.**
