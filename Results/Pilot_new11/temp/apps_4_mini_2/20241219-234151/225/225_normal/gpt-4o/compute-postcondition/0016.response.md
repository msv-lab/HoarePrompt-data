To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the details provided in the initial and subsequent states. 

**Initial State:** 
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100. 
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is initialized to 1.
- `prev_pos` is initialized to -1.

The loop iterates over each character of the string `s`. For every character that is found to be a vowel, `max_jump` is updated based on the position of the last found vowel (`prev_pos`), which is also updated to the current index of the vowel.

1. If there are no vowels in the string `s`, `prev_pos` remains -1, and `max_jump` will not be updated beyond its initial value of 1. Consequently, the indices will go from 0 to the length of `s` minus one, but no updates to `max_jump` or `prev_pos` will have occurred.
2. If one or more vowels are found, then `prev_pos` will be updated to the last index where a vowel was found, and `max_jump` will reflect the distance between the current index and the previous vowel index at all times. 

Thus, the output after all iterations would depend on the number of vowels:

- If there are vowels, `max_jump` would represent the maximum distance between consecutive vowels, and `prev_pos` would be the index of the last vowel found. 
- If no vowels exist in `s`, `prev_pos` remains -1, and `max_jump` remains 1.

Using the key points to construct the output state:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `max_jump` is the maximum distance between consecutive vowels or 1 if no vowels are present, `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel found or -1 if no vowels exist.**
