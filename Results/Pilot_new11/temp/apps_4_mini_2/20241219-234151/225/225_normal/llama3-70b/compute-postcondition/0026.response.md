The loop processes each character in the string `s` to determine the maximum "jump" between vowels. The final output state depends on how many times the loop executed and the content of the string.

If the loop executes:

Output State after the loop executes N times (where N is the number of vowels in `s`):
1. `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters.
2. `n` is the length of `s`.
3. `max_jump` is the maximum distance (in terms of index) between two consecutive vowels divided by 2, rounded up, plus 1 (considering the jump from the start to the first vowel if applicable).
4. `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s`, which would be the position of the last vowel in the string when the loop has completed execution.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `n` is 0), the state will be:
1. `s` could be an empty string.
2. `n` is 0 and both `last_vowel` and `max_jump` will remain unchanged as initialized.

Final Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters; `n` is the length of `s`; `max_jump` is the maximum jump length calculated based on the positions of vowels; `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string.**
