In the given code snippet, `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the calculation of `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. The preconditions state that `i` is 0, implying the current index in the string `s`, and that `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, indicating the last index of a vowel previously encountered.

1. Since `i = 0` and the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel, we can infer that `last_vowel` must have a defined positive index that is less than `i`, leading to a possible jump calculation.
2. The expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` computes the jump distance from `last_vowel` to the current position `i`.
3. The outcome of `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` will depend on the value of `last_vowel`.

The actual value of `max_jump` will depend on its prior value, which is not specified, so we cannot calculate a definitive output for it.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, and `max_jump` is updated to either its current value or `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, (0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)**
