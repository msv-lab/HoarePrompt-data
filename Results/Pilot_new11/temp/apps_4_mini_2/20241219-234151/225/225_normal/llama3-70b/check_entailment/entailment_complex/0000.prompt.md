You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of the string does not exceed 100.
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters; `n` is the length of `s`; `max_jump` is the maximum jump length calculated based on the positions of vowels; `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string.
    if (last_vowel != n - 1) :
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `max_jump` is updated to `new_max_jump`, which is calculated as the maximum of `old_max_jump` and half of the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string plus one.
    print(max_jump)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 characters. It calculates the maximum jump length based on the positions of the vowels (A, E, I, O, U, Y) in the string. If the last vowel is not the last character in the string, it also considers the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. The maximum jump length is then printed. The function does not handle cases where the string might contain no vowels, but it correctly handles scenarios where vowels are present and the last vowel occurs at various positions in the string. The final state of the program includes the printed maximum jump length that reflects the calculated jump based on the input string.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
