The variable `max_jump` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Since `i` is currently `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`. Therefore, `max_jump` will be updated to be the greater of its current value and `1`. The values of other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `last_vowel`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 1)**.
