According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` regarding `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute one more time. In this case, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will be 2. 

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2.**
