The variable `max_jump` is assigned the value of the maximum between its current value and the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. The impact of this code depends on the value of `last_vowel`, which is not provided explicitly in the initial state.

Since `i` is equal to 1 and if `last_vowel` is known, the result of `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` can be calculated accordingly. For the purpose of defining the output state, let's denote `j` as `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, where `j` can take different values depending on the actual `last_vowel`.

Given this information, we can state that `max_jump` will be adjusted based on the comparison involving `j` and its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the expression `((1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`**.
