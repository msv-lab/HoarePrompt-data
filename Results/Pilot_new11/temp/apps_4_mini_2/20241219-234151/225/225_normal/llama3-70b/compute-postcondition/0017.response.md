Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of `max_jump` and 2. Otherwise, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the expression `((1 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`.***
