To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the components involved:

1. The loop iterates `i` from `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`.

2. The input string `s` consists of capital English letters. Therefore, it is necessary for `s` to be a non-empty string.

3. Since the loop index `i` starts at `0`, before the first execution, `i` is initialized to `0`.

4. Other variables such as `vowels`, `max_jump`, and `last_vowel` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they may be used within the loop body.

Taking these considerations into account, the state must indicate that `n` is greater than `0` and highlight that `i` is initialized to `0`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments can be summarized as follows:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
