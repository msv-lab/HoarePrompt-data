To analyze the code snippet:

1. `max_jump` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.
2. The calculation `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` indicates a jump based on the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, adjusted by dividing by 2 and adding 1.

Let's break it down with the provided initial conditions:

- `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s` (which is at least 1).
- `max_jump` is a value that is not specified but is updated based on the new calculation.
- `last_vowel` is some index of the last vowel found in `s`, and since the last character of `s` is not a vowel, it follows that `last_vowel` < `n - 1`.

After running the code, we determine:

- `max_jump` is updated based on the comparison of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

Letâ€™s denote:
- Old `max_jump`: `old_max_jump`
- The new value of `max_jump`: `new_max_jump` which equals to `max(old_max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`.

Thus, the output state summarizing the changes is as follows:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string, and `max_jump` is updated to `new_max_jump`, which is equal to `max(old_max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`**.
