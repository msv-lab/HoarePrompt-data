The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 characters. It calculates the maximum jump length based on the positions of the vowels (A, E, I, O, U, Y) in the string. If the last vowel is not the last character in the string, it also considers the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. The maximum jump length is then printed. The function does not handle cases where the string might contain no vowels, but it correctly handles scenarios where vowels are present and the last vowel occurs at various positions in the string. The final state of the program includes the printed maximum jump length that reflects the calculated jump based on the input string.
