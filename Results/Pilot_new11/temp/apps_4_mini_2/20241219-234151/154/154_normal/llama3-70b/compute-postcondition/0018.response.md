Initial State: `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2·10^9, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user, `dp` is a list of lists with dimensions (k + 1) x (M + 1) initialized to 0, `i` is 1.

After all iterations of the loop:

- `n` is between 1 and 45.
- `k` is between 1 and 45.
- `M` is up to 2·10^9.
- `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user.
- `dp[1][j]` reflects values based on the algorithm executed over the range from `1` to `M` with the calculations dependent on the contents of `t` and previous values of `dp`.
- Specifically, `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0, and for each `j` from `1` to `M`, `dp[1][j]` remains 0 if `j` is less than `t[0]` (the first element of `t`). If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[0]`, then `dp[1][j]` would equal 1 reflecting the opportunity to select the first element of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2·10^9; `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp[1][j]` is either 0 or 1; if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[0]`, then `dp[1][j]` is equal to 1, otherwise `dp[1][j]` is 0.**
