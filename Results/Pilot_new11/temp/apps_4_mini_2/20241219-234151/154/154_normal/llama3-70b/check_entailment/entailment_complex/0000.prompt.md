You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 45, k is an integer between 1 and 45, M is a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2·10^9; `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp[k][j]` contains the maximum number of times the items can be used to reach each value from 0 to `M`, reflecting all combinations of the first `k` items.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 1 and 45), k (an integer between 1 and 45), M (a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9), and t (a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000). It computes the maximum number of combinations of the elements in the list t that can sum to different values up to M, using dynamic programming to account for all possible ways to select the items. After executing, the function outputs an integer representing the total number of ways to achieve exactly M using the elements of t, along with an additional count of how many times these combinations include all available items. Since the input to t is sorted, the function efficiently utilizes this property while determining its output. The function does not return a value but directly prints the computed result. Edge cases such as when k or M are zero would need explicit handling to avoid erroneous calculations, but as per the code, there is no explicit check for such scenarios.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
