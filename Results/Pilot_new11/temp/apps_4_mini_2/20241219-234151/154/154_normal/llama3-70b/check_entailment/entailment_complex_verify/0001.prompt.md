You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn based on the problem description, but it contains logical flaws that would lead to incorrect outputs.

One critical issue arises in its dynamic programming (DP) approach:

1. The program tries to calculate how many subtasks can be completed given the time limit `M`, but it does not properly account for the concept of earning extra points for completing entire tasks (k subtasks). 

2. The line:
   `sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i))` is intended to calculate the extra points for completely solving tasks, but it is incorrect because it checks if `dp[i][M] == i`, which does not accurately measure if an entire task was completed in the context of the number of tasks `n` available. 

For an example to illustrate this flaw:

Consider the input:
```
1 1 1
1
```
For this case, Polycarp has only one task which contains one subtask that takes 1 minute. He has exactly 1 minute available. Following the problem description, he should solve this subtask and gain 2 points (1 point for completing the subtask + 1 point for completing the full task). However, the program would calculate this incorrectly as it fails to reflect the points gained from completing the entire task.

Overall, the program incorrectly implements the point system and calculations for multiple tasks versus subtasks, leading to inaccuracies in potential outputs. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 45, k is an integer between 1 and 45, M is a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2·10^9; `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp[k][j]` contains the maximum number of times the items can be used to reach each value from 0 to `M`, reflecting all combinations of the first `k` items.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 1 and 45), k (an integer between 1 and 45), M (a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9), and t (a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000). It computes the maximum number of combinations of the elements in the list t that can sum to different values up to M, using dynamic programming to account for all possible ways to select the items. After executing, the function outputs an integer representing the total number of ways to achieve exactly M using the elements of t, along with an additional count of how many times these combinations include all available items. Since the input to t is sorted, the function efficiently utilizes this property while determining its output. The function does not return a value but directly prints the computed result. Edge cases such as when k or M are zero would need explicit handling to avoid erroneous calculations, but as per the code, there is no explicit check for such scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
