The assignment `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. The variables `i` and `j` are known (where `i` is 2 and `j` is 1), which means this assignment references `dp[2][0]`, given that `j - 1` equals 0. 

Assuming that `dp` is a 2D list or array and that the values of `dp[i][j]` for indices are initialized, the value of `dp[2][1]` will be updated to be equal to the value of `dp[2][0]`. The variables `n`, `k`, `M`, `i`, and `j` are not altered by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged for `n`, `k`, and `M`. The only variable that has changed is `dp[2][1]`, which is now equal to `dp[2][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `dp[2][1]` is equal to `dp[2][0]**
