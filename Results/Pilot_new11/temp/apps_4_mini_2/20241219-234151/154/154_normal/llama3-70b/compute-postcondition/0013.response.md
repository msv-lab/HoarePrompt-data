Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is up to 2Â·10^9 (must be greater than or equal to 2); `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0; `dp[i][2]` is equal to 0; if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is either unchanged or has increased based on the maximum value between `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.***
