To evaluate the impact of the code snippet, we need to analyze the assignment operation and the values of the involved variables.

Initially, we have:
- `n` is between 1 and 45
- `k` is between 1 and 45
- `M` is at least 3
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 3
- `dp[2][3]` is set to `dp[2][2]`

The code being executed is:
```python
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
```
Here, we can see that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, thus:
- `dp[i][j]` refers to `dp[2][3]`
- `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` translates to `dp[1][3 - t[1]]`

The overall effect of this operation will depend on the values of `dp[2][3]`, `dp[1][3 - t[1]]`, and `t[1]`, but we know `dp[2][3]` will be updated to the maximum of itself or the result of the expression `dp[1][3 - t[1]] + 1`.

Since we don't have specific values for `dp` or `t`, we can only describe the new state in a generalized way. We can infer that `dp[2][3]` will be greater than or equal to its previous value.

Thus, the output state will emphasize what hasn't changed and include the new relation for `dp[2][3]`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `dp[2][3]` is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1][3 - t[1]] + 1`.**
