According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. We are given that at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `M` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 3. We also need to ensure that `j` does not exceed `M` for the loop to run. Hence, `M` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and `dp[i][2]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`.**
