Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn based on the problem description, but it contains logical flaws that would lead to incorrect outputs.

One critical issue arises in its dynamic programming (DP) approach:

1. The program tries to calculate how many subtasks can be completed given the time limit `M`, but it does not properly account for the concept of earning extra points for completing entire tasks (k subtasks). 

2. The line:
   `sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i))` is intended to calculate the extra points for completely solving tasks, but it is incorrect because it checks if `dp[i][M] == i`, which does not accurately measure if an entire task was completed in the context of the number of tasks `n` available. 

For an example to illustrate this flaw:

Consider the input:
```
1 1 1
1
```
For this case, Polycarp has only one task which contains one subtask that takes 1 minute. He has exactly 1 minute available. Following the problem description, he should solve this subtask and gain 2 points (1 point for completing the subtask + 1 point for completing the full task). However, the program would calculate this incorrectly as it fails to reflect the points gained from completing the entire task.

Overall, the program incorrectly implements the point system and calculations for multiple tasks versus subtasks, leading to inaccuracies in potential outputs. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
