The code assigns the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i][j - 1]`. Since `j` is currently 3, this means `dp[i][3]` will take on the value of `dp[i][2]`. The precondition states that `dp[i][2]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`, but no specific values for `dp` are provided, so we cannot define those values explicitly.

Thus the relevant changes are that `dp[i][3]` will now hold the same value as `dp[i][2]`, which is itself equal to `dp[i][1]`. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `dp[i][2]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`, and `dp[i][3]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`.**
