According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `M`. The loop will iterate while `j` is in the range from 1 to `M`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` was equal to 1, and `M` is up to 2·10^9 (which is greater than 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, we need to ensure that `j` is at least 2 for the next iteration. The updated values after the next iteration would imply that `j` is now 2, while `M` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2·10^9 (must be greater than or equal to 2), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user, and `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0. Now for `j`, it is equal to 2.**
