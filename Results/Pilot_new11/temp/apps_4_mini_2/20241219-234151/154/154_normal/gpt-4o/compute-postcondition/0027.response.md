The expression `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)` updates the value of `subtasks_solved`. 

- `subtasks_solved` will take the minimum value between its previous value and the value of `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. 
- Given the initial state, `subtasks_solved` is defined as the total number of subtasks that could be solved given the initial `remaining_time` with respect to all subtask times in `t`. 
- The expression `(n - complete_tasks) * k` calculates the maximum possible subtasks that can still be completed based on the remaining subtasks (`n - complete_tasks`) multiplied by the number of subtasks per task (`k`).

The values of `n`, `k`, `complete_tasks`, and the initial value of `subtasks_solved` will determine the new value of `subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.**
