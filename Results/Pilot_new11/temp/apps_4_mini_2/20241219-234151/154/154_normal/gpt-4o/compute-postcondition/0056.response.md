The variable `time_used` is reassigned the value of `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. Given that `complete_tasks` is 2 and `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the list `t`, the new value of `time_used` will be calculated as 2 times the sum of the elements in `t`. The constraints state `remaining_time` is less than 0, indicating that `M - total_time_per_task` is negative, but this constraint does not impact the calculation of `time_used`.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values and valid preconditions are:

- `n` is such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 45
- `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45
- `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9
- `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`
- `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`
- `complete_tasks` is 2
- `points` is equal to `k + 1`
- `remaining_time` is less than 0
- `subtasks_solved` remains 0
- `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`

Output State: **`n` is such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is less than 0, `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
