Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here’s a detailed explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the values for `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t` of subtask times. It maintains the constraints specified: `1 ≤ n ≤ 45`, `1 ≤ k ≤ 45`, `0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9`, and `1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000`.

2. **Correct Logic for Points Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `total_time_per_task`, which is the total time required to complete all subtasks for a single task by summing the elements of `t`.
   - It correctly iterates through all possible numbers of complete tasks that Polycarp can complete within the available time `M`. The outer loop iterates from `0` to `n`, allowing us to evaluate every possible number of task completions.

3. **Tracking Time and Points:**
   - For each possible number of complete tasks:
     - It calculates `time_used` to see if it exceeds `M`. If it does, the loop breaks, preventing further unnecessary calculations.
     - The points for completed tasks are correctly computed as `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
     - The program then calculates `remaining_time` correctly based on how much time has already been used after completing a specific number of tasks.

4. **Subtask Calculation Logic:**
   - The nested loop calculates how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time. It checks each subtask time in `t` and updates the number of subtasks solved `subtasks_solved` accordingly.
   - The line `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)` ensures that it does not count more subtasks than feasible given the remaining number of tasks that are yet to be completed.

5. **Final Calculation of Maximum Points:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum points that can be achieved through the line `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)`. This ensures that the highest possible score across all scenarios is returned.

6. **Return Value:** The function returns `max_points`, which corresponds exactly to the requirements of the problem: the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn based on the tasks and subtasks he can complete within the allowed time.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic necessary to solve the problem as outlined, handling all the edge cases described in the problem statement. Thus, it is evaluated as correct.
