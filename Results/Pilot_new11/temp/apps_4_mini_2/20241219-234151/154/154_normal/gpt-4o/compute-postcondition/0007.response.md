The code assigns a new value to the variable `points` based on the value of `complete_tasks` and `k`. Given that `complete_tasks` is currently `0` (as stated in the initial conditions), the formula `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)` simplifies to `points = 0 * (k + 1)`, which results in `points` being `0`. The values of other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers in the range 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in the list `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
