Postcondition: ***`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9; `t` is a list of at least 3 integers; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `complete_tasks` is 0; `time_used` is greater than `M`; `points` is 0; and `remaining_time` has increased by `subtask_time` and `subtasks_solved` is -2 if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`. Otherwise, if `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, the program does not update any variables, maintaining the initial state.***
