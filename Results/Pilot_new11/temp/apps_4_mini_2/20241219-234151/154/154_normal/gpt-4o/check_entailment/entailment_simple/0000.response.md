To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze if the program accurately calculates the maximum points that Polycarp can earn given the constraints and requirements detailed in the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Polycarp has `n` tasks, each consisting of `k` subtasks.
2. Each subtask takes a certain amount of time (`t_j` for the j-th subtask).
3. Points are earned as follows:
   - 1 point for each solved subtask.
   - An additional point for completely solving one task (i.e., solving all `k` subtasks).
4. There is a time limit (`M` minutes) within which Polycarp must work.

### Program Review:
- The program correctly reads `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, the times for solving each subtask.
- The `func_1` function calculates the maximum number of points that can be earned:
  - It iteratively determines how many complete tasks (`complete_tasks`) Polycarp can perform without exceeding `M` minutes.
  - For each potential number of complete tasks:
    - It calculates the remaining time (`remaining_time`) after completing those tasks.
    - It counts the number of additional subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time, considering the time taken for each subtask.
    - Finally, it keeps track of the maximum points earned by summing the points from complete tasks and the solved subtasks.
  
The logic encapsulated within the `func_1` function adheres strictly to the requirements as follows:
- The loop for `complete_tasks` runs from 0 to `n`, ensuring every possible combination of complete tasks is considered.
- For each count of complete tasks, the calculation of `points` and `remaining_time` is handled correctly, as is the counting of potential additional subtasks that could be solved.
- The conditions for updating `max_points` ensure that the maximum possible score is tracked throughout the iteration over the number of complete tasks.

### Conclusion:
The program effectively follows the problem description:
- It correctly calculates both the points from completely solving tasks and additional points from the subtasks that can be completed with the remaining time.
- The edge cases (like not having enough time for even the simplest subtasks) are inherently handled by limiting `remaining_time`.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
