Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 45, `k` is at least 1, `M` is greater than or equal to `time_used`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of a valid `t`, `remaining_time` is non-negative (if the loop executed), `subtasks_solved` is equal to the total number of subtasks solved across all valid calls to the loop, `t` remains unchanged, and `remaining_time` is adjusted based on the total time spent solving subtasks using values from `t`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if no `subtask_time` in `t` allows for sufficient `remaining_time`), then `remaining_time` remains less than or equal to `M - time_used` and `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
