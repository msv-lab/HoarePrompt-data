According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `complete_tasks` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `complete_tasks` is 1, and `n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45. For the loop to execute one more time, `complete_tasks` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `complete_tasks` will be 2. 

Since `n` can be up to 45 and `complete_tasks` is now 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - total_time_per_task` (and is less than 0), and `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
