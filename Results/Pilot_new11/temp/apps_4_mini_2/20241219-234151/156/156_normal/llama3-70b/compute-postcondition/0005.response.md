Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer entered from input, which is even and within the range of `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`; `m` is an integer entered from input within the same range; `k` is now `k % (n * 2 - 2)` where `0 ≤ k < n · m`; `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2.***
