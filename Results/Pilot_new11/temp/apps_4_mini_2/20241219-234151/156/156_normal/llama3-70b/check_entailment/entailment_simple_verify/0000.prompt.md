You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program given the problem description, let's analyze the logic and flow of the code.

### Problem Specification
Lara starts at (1, 1) in a rectangular matrix and moves as specified in a snake fashion. The movements can be broken down as follows:
1. Move down the first column from (1, 1) to (n, 1).
2. Move to the right across the last row, then move up one cell, and continue in this zigzag pattern until she runs out of non-visited cells.

### Review of the Program
```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)
```

1. **First column movement**: The first `if` checks if `k` is less than `n-1`, which means she is still in the first column. In this case, it prints the current row as `k + 1`, and the column as `1`. This part works correctly for initial movements.

2. **Snake pattern movement**: The second `elif` branch handles the snake movements. The calculation involves figuring out where she would be based on her zigzag traversal. The formula used to determine her current position is crucial.

3. **Final Check**: The last `else` handles a wrap-around and goes to (1, 2) when `k` is exactly `n * 2 - 2`, which means she has finished all possible movements.

### Testing Edge Cases
1. **Case with maximum columns**: Let's test a large `k` value close to the maximum:
   - If `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 11`:
     - The expected output is (1, 2), which is indeed handled correctly.
   
2. **Out of bounds on zigzag**: A critical area to assess is around calculating the zigzag movements. We are given that `k` can be much larger than the field because `0 ≤ k < n*m`.

3. **Transitioning from moves in first column to zigzag**: Check the transition from the first column to the snake pattern:
   - If `k = n - 1`, output should still yield (n, 1).
   - If `k = n`, it should now compute the position in the zigzag path correctly. 

### Failure Point
When analyzing the calculations:
- The condition inside the second `elif` might not correctly handle negative indices or wrap around scenarios prevalent when moving through constants in calculations with the zigzag.
  
After careful consideration, while most of the implementation appears sound, the complex index manipulation could potentially miscalculate for many edge cases, particularly very large `k` values iterating over the full range of `n` and `m`. 

### Conclusion
The program can miscalculate positions during the zigzag movement and does not seem to account for all potential cell accesses properly consistently across the boundaries. Thus, I find a clearly indicating failure point upon close observation.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is even; k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer within the range of `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `m` is an integer within the same range, and `k` is an integer such that `0 ≤ k < n · m` and `k ≥ n - 1`. If `k < n * 2 - 2`, the first output is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and the second output is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. Otherwise, the outputs are 1 and 2.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer within the range of `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, and `m` is an integer within the same range. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then 'k + 1' has been printed alongside '1'. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, the first output will be `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and the second output will be `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the outputs will be 1 and 2.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
