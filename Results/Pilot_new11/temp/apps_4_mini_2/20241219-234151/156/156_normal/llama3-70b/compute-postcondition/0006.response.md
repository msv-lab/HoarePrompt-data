The output of the provided code calculates two values based on the input integers `n` and `k`. Here are the steps taken based on the initial conditions:

1. **Calculate the first value**: 
   - The expression is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`.
   - Simplifying inside the parentheses: `k - n + 1` is computed first, whose value can vary based on `k`.
   - The `%` operator with `(n - 1)` means we are looking for the remainder when `(k - n + 1)` is divided by `(n - 1)`.
   - Thus, this evaluates to a value less than `n - 1`, as it is the remainder operation.

2. **Calculate the second value**: 
   - The expression is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`.
   - This division gives us how many whole `(n - 1)`s fit into `(k - n + 1)`, and then we add `1`.

These calculations do not change any of the initial conditions described, so we will retain them while also specifying the output from the computations. 

The result of the computations as a formula in terms of `n` and `k`, without loss of generality, will retain the range for the output values, which includes:

- First output: `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`
- Second output: `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`

Since there's no specific numerical input provided for `n` and `k`, the exact numeric results cannot be specified. 

Therefore, the final Output State is formulated accordingly, capturing the variables involved:

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered from input, which is even and within the range of `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`; `m` is an integer entered from input within the same range; `k` is now `k % (n * 2 - 2)` where `0 ≤ k < n · m`; `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2; First output is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`; Second output is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`.**
