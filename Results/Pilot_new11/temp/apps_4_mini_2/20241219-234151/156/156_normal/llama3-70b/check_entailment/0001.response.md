Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, consider the following test case:

**Input:**  
`4 3 9`  

According to the problem description, after 9 moves, Lara should be at cell (3, 1) based on the defined movement pattern. However, the program calculates her position as follows:

1. The `k` value after modulus operation will yield `9 % (4 * 2 - 2) = 9 % 6 = 3`.
2. The code then checks which range `k` falls into. Since `k (3)` is less than `n - 1 (3)`, it mistakenly calculates the position as:
   ```python
   print(k + 1, 1)  # This outputs (4, 1)
   ``` 
   This is incorrect, as it should output (3, 1).

This discrepancy demonstrates that the logic handling the snake-like movement is flawed, resulting in an incorrect output for at least this input case. Thus, the program is not correct as per the problem requirements.
