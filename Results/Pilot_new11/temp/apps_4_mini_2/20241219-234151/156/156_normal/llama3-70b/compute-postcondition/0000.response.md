The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated by reading from the input, where `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold integers. The preconditions that `n` and `m` are integers such that `2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9`, `n` is even, and `k` is a non-negative integer satisfying `0 ≤ k < n·m` remain valid. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer entered from input, `m` is an integer entered from input, `k` is a non-negative integer entered from input such that 0 ≤ k < n·m, and 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and n is even.**
