`full_rows` is assigned the value of `k` divided by `(m - 1)`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer and `m` is between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive), the division will yield a non-negative integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, but `full_rows` will be updated based on the formula provided.  

The values of `n` and `m` do not directly impact the calculation of `full_rows`, but we note that `(m - 1)` will always be at least 1 because `m` is at least 2. Thus, the calculation for `full_rows` will result in a non-negative integer reflecting how many full rows can be formed given `k` and the width defined by `m - 1`. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`; `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`**.
