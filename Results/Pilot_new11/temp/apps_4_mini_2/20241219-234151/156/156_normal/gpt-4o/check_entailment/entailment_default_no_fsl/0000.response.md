To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in accordance with the specified problem description, let's analyze the program step by step along with the examples given.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the number of rows, columns, and the number of steps Lara has moved, respectively.

2. **Movement Logic**:
    - If `k` is less than `n - 1` (the number of steps to reach the bottom of the first column), it prints Lara's position directly in the first column.
    - If `k` is `>= n - 1`, the program calculates how many full rows of movement Lara has completed and how many additional steps remain once full rows are accounted for.

3. **Row and Column Calculation**:
    - The movement alternates rows when completing a full horizontal row, depending on whether the number of complete rows (of horizontal movement) is even or odd.
    - The row and column indices are updated based on these calculations.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The program ensures that `n` is always even and properly handles the input bounds.
- Since the output hints and reasoning describe valid behaviors regarding all specified inputs, the program seems to cover the expected behavior as outlined.

### Key Observations:
- The movement path visually corresponds with how Lara would traverse an `n x m` matrix; therefore, the computation for even rows and odd rows remains logical.
  
### Testing with Examples:
1. **Example 1**: Input `(4, 3, 0)` expects output `(1, 1)`.
2. **Example 2**: Input `(4, 3, 11)` expects output `(1, 2)`.
3. **Example 3**: Input `(4, 3, 7)` expects output `(3, 2)`.

The program works correctly according to these examples as it computes the respective positions after `k` moves.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the code and its behavior in the described setup, it meets the requirements and correctly handles all potential cases defined in the problem.

**Correctness: True**. 

The program accurately determines Lara's position based on her defined movement pattern for all valid inputs specified in the problem statement.
