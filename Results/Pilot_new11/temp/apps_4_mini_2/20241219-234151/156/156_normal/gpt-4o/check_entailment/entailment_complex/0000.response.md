To determine if the given program meets the requirements of the problem description, we will analyze the logic and the flow of the code in relation to the task that needs to be performed.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads three integers: `n`, `m`, and `k`. According to the problem description, `n` is even and within the range of 2 to 10^9, `m` is also within the range of 2 to 10^9, and `k` is non-negative and less than `n * m`. 

2. **Path of Movement**:
   - Lara starts at (1, 1) and moves down to (n, 1), which accounts for `n-1` moves. This is handled by checking if `k < n - 1`. If true, it correctly prints `(k + 1, 1)`.

3. **Snake-like Movement**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program correctly adjusts `k` by subtracting the number of downward moves made, which is `n - 1`. The subsequent calculations utilize the modified value of `k`:
     - It calculates the number of full rows crossed: `full_rows = k // (m - 1)`.
     - It then identifies how many remaining steps are made in the current row: `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`.

4. **Row and Column Calculation**:
   - The row number `row` is derived from `full_rows`. Given `n - full_rows`, if `full_rows` is even, Lara's column moves to `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, it adjusts the column to `m - remaining_steps`. This effectively captures the snake-like movement where she alternates directions in different rows.

### Evaluation of the Correctness:
- The program implements all required conditions specified in the problem description.
- It accurately translates the movement pattern of Lara into its logic:
  - It handles both cases when `k` is less than `n - 1` and when it is greater than or equal.
  - It calculates final coordinates based on the described movement strategy without losing validity under the constraints.

The edge cases are well-covered, including maximum allowed values for `k`, as it uses integer division and modulus operations effectively, ensuring that it stays within defined bounds.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program reliably carries out the requirements of the problem statement for all given constraints and scenarios. Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
