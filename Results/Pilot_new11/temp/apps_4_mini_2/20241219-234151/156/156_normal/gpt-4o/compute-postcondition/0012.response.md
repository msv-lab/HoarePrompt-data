Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`. If `full_rows` is an even non-negative integer, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is even, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is an odd integer, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is odd, and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.***
