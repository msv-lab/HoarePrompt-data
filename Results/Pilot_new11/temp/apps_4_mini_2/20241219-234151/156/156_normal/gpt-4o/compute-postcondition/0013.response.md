The code provided is a print statement, which outputs the current values of `row` and `col`. Given the initial state, we know that:

- If `full_rows` is even, then `row = n - full_rows` (which will also be even) and `col = 2 + remaining_steps`.
- If `full_rows` is odd, then `row = n - full_rows` (which will be odd) and `col = m - remaining_steps`.

However, the specific values of `full_rows`, `remaining_steps`, `row`, and `col` are not given or defined. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact output values for `row` and `col` because they depend on the specific values of `full_rows` and `remaining_steps`.

Thus, the Output State is dictated by the variables that remain unchanged but inform us of their relationships. The output just specifies that the current values of `row` and `col` will be printed based on the condition of `full_rows`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`; `row` and `col` will be printed based on the evenness of `full_rows` as `row` = `n - full_rows` and `col` will depend on `remaining_steps`.**
