To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the logic described in the problem and compare it with what the program attempts to do.

The problem specifies that:
1. At time t = 1 to k, the number of standing spectators increases from 1 to k.
2. At time t = k + 1, the first spectator sits, while the (k + 1)-th spectator stands. This continues until all spectators have either stood or sat down as described.
3. At time t = n + 1 to n + k, the last standing spectators begin to sit down until nobody is standing by t = n + k.

### Analyzing the Program:

The provided program code is:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

**Breakdown of the code logic:**
1. `min(t, k) if t <= n`: This correctly calculates how many spectators are standing if `t` is within the first `n` time units. For times from 1 to k, this returns `t` (the count of spectators standing).
2. If `t` exceeds `n`, the formula `k - (t - n) % k` is used. This implies that there are standing spectators that are continuously decreasing after `t` surpasses `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
We should consider if the calculation for `t` being greater than `n` appropriately accounts for all scenarios described. Specifically:
1. **Case 1:** Let's examine what happens at `t = n + 1`. If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 11`. According to the wave pattern:
   - At time `11`: The number of spectators should be `4` (since the first has sat and the last remains standing).
   - The program would compute `k - (t - n) % k = 5 - (11 - 10) % 5` which results in `5 - 1 = 4`, which is correct.
   
2. **Case 2:** Now consider `t = n + k = 15`. In this case:
   - At time `15`, all spectators should be sitting, which means the number of standing spectators should be `0`.
   - The program would compute `k - (15 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 5 % 5 = 5 - 0 = 5`, which is incorrect.

Since at this particular case, when `t` is equal to `n + k`, the program does not return the correct number of standing spectators (it incorrectly returns 5 instead of 0), we can conclude that the logic for handling times beyond `n` is flawed.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
