You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the logic described in the problem and compare it with what the program attempts to do.

The problem specifies that:
1. At time t = 1 to k, the number of standing spectators increases from 1 to k.
2. At time t = k + 1, the first spectator sits, while the (k + 1)-th spectator stands. This continues until all spectators have either stood or sat down as described.
3. At time t = n + 1 to n + k, the last standing spectators begin to sit down until nobody is standing by t = n + k.

### Analyzing the Program:

The provided program code is:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

**Breakdown of the code logic:**
1. `min(t, k) if t <= n`: This correctly calculates how many spectators are standing if `t` is within the first `n` time units. For times from 1 to k, this returns `t` (the count of spectators standing).
2. If `t` exceeds `n`, the formula `k - (t - n) % k` is used. This implies that there are standing spectators that are continuously decreasing after `t` surpasses `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
We should consider if the calculation for `t` being greater than `n` appropriately accounts for all scenarios described. Specifically:
1. **Case 1:** Let's examine what happens at `t = n + 1`. If `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 11`. According to the wave pattern:
   - At time `11`: The number of spectators should be `4` (since the first has sat and the last remains standing).
   - The program would compute `k - (t - n) % k = 5 - (11 - 10) % 5` which results in `5 - 1 = 4`, which is correct.
   
2. **Case 2:** Now consider `t = n + k = 15`. In this case:
   - At time `15`, all spectators should be sitting, which means the number of standing spectators should be `0`.
   - The program would compute `k - (15 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 5 % 5 = 5 - 0 = 5`, which is incorrect.

Since at this particular case, when `t` is equal to `n + k`, the program does not return the correct number of standing spectators (it incorrectly returns 5 instead of 0), we can conclude that the logic for handling times beyond `n` is flawed.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases as expected.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers, `n`, `k`, and `t`, where the constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. It calculates a result based on the value of `t` in relation to `n` and `k`. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, it returns the minimum of `t` and `k`. If `t` is greater than `n`, it computes `k - (t - n) % k`, which determines a cyclical offset based on how far `t` exceeds `n`. The function prints this result and does not return any values. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `t` is exactly `n`, less than `n`, or significantly greater than `n`, which inform how the function resolves inputs to outputs. Moreover, the function does not handle invalid inputs or exceptions, which could lead to issues in production scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
