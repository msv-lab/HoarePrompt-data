The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. All these parameters are non-negative integers constrained such that \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). However, the output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without specific output details, we cannot describe the functionality regarding returns. 

In conclusion, since no further output logic is available, the functionality can only be partially described based on the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: x, y, and z, which are non-negative integers satisfying the condition \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\).**
