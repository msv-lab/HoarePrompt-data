Functionality: **The function accepts three non-negative integer inputs: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which should lie within the range of 0 to 100. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs. The function then evaluates and prints the result based on certain conditions: if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it outputs a negative sign ('-'); if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it outputs a positive sign ('+'); if neither of these conditions hold, it outputs a question mark ('?'). The output thus indicates the relationship between possible upvote and downvote counts considering the influence of `z`, but it does not return any value or modify the input parameters. No edge cases for invalid input handling are present, and the function lacks the ability to handle inputs or output results beyond printing to the console.**
