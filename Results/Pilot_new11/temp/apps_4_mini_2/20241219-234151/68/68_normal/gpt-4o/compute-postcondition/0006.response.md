The execution of the code simply prints a string `'-'`. It does not affect the values of any of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the variables in the initial state. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`.**
