To determine the states needed for the loop to execute, let’s analyze the provided state and the loop.

1. The variable `n` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once since n will be at least 1.

2. The variable `i` is initialized and increments with each iteration of the loop, starting from 0 and going up to n-1. Thus, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the starting value of 0, as that is where the loop begins.

The loop is guaranteed to start since `n` is a positive integer, thus ensuring that the loop executes from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop will include that `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `i` is 0**
