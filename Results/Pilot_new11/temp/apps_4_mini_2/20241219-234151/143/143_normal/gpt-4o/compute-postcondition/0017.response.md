The variable `answer` is assigned the value of `max_cost`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `dp[i]`) remain unchanged, as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is the minimum value calculated through the loop for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, retaining the updated minimums based on prior values, original values for `dp[i]` for `i < n`, and `dp[i]` above `n` has retained its value or the minimum from `c` for those indices; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`.
