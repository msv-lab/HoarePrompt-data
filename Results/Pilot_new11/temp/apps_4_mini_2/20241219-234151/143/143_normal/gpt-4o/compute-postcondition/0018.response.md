The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value of 0. The other variables maintain their previous values, and there are no other changes to the state of the initial variables provided. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is the minimum value calculated through the loop for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, retaining the updated minimums based on prior values, original values for `dp[i]` for `i < n`, and `dp[i]` above `n` has retained its value or the minimum from `c` for those indices; `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is 0.**
