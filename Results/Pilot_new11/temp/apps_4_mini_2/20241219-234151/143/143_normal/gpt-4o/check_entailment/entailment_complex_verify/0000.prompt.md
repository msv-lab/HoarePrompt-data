You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the given program against the problem description, we need to consider if it correctly computes the smallest number of roubles needed to buy at least L liters of lemonade using the available bottle types.

### Let's analyze the provided program:

1. The program first reads the input values: the number of bottle types `n`, the required volume `L`, and an array `costs` representing the costs of each type of bottle.
   
2. It defines a function `func_1(n, L, costs)` which is meant to compute the minimum cost.

3. It initializes an array `dp` of length 31 (to account for bottle volumes from \(2^0\) to \(2^{30} - 1\)), setting its values to a very high number (`max_cost`).

4. The program then tries to set the minimum cost for all bottle sizes based on the given costs.

5. It calculates the minimum cost to purchase the necessary lemonade using a dynamic programming approach, adjusting the amount of required lemonade (`L`) as it iterates through possible volumes.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- The logic assumes bottles of every type can be accessed for each doubling of liters. If costs for higher volume bottles aren't handled correctly, or if they are disproportionately expensive, it could lead to incorrect outcomes.
  
- It could also fail if `L` is set to a value less than the smallest bottle size, which might cause all adjustments in costs to incorrectly skip necessary calculations.

#### A specific case to consider:

- For example, if we input:
```
4 0
10 20 30 40
```
We are asking for at least 0 liters, which should technically result in a cost of 0 (since we don't need any lemonade). However, this case might not be correctly handled by the current implementation, because the logic might incorrectly interpret this request when checking if L >= \(1 << i\). 

### Conclusion:

Given the potential misunderstanding in calculating costs for edge cases involving small `L` values or specific cases when `L` is 0, the given program does not sufficiently handle every aspect of the problem description and could return incorrect values.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the case where no lemonade is needed correctly, which could lead to an unnecessary spend when it should be zero.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n integers where each integer c_i (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost of a bottle of type i.
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `i` is `n-1`; `dp[i]` is updated to min(`dp[i]`, `c[i]`) for all 0 ≤ i < n; `dp` contains the minimum values from `c` for the first `n` indices and retains the original value of 10^18 for the rest.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is the minimum value calculated through the loop for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, retaining the updated minimums based on prior values, original values for `dp[i]` for `i < n`, and `dp[i]` above `n` has retained its value or the minimum from `c` for those indices.
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: When the loop is fully executed, we observe:
    #- `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` where \(2^i\) was deducted from `L`.
    #- `answer` is the minimum of its original value and the final computed `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[0]`.
    #- `L` will reflect any deductions made during the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output can be summarized as:
    #Output State:
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum of `answer`'s original value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[0]`, where `current_cost` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` where \(2^i\) was deducted from `L`, and `L` reflects any deductions made during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer indicating the number of different bottle types; `L`, a positive integer representing the total amount available for spending; and `costs`, a list of integers detailing the cost of each bottle type. The function calculates and returns the minimum cost required to buy bottles such that the total volume of the bottles meets or exceeds `L`.

The function operates as follows:
1. It initializes a dynamic programming list, `dp`, to track the minimum cost of bottles for volumes from 0 up to 30 (with 31 indices) and fills it with a maximum cost placeholder.
2. It updates the `dp` list to reflect the minimum costs for the first `n` bottle types.
3. It then iterates through the `dp` list, updating it to account for the doubling of previous values to compute costs for additional volumes.
4. Finally, it computes the minimum cost by checking how many different volume powers of two can be used to meet the requirement `L`, updating the `current_cost` accordingly, and considers additional costs based on any remaining `L`.

The function ultimately returns the minimum value between the initially set maximum answer and a calculated total that considers how many bottles can be purchased with the provided budget based on their respective costs. Edge cases include scenarios where `L` is larger than what can be achieved with available bottle types, as well as cases where `n` could be at its minimum or maximum limits. The function ensures that the total costs remain within the bounds of available costs, and it handles situations where some bottle types may not be necessary for achieving the desired volume due to cost constraints.
