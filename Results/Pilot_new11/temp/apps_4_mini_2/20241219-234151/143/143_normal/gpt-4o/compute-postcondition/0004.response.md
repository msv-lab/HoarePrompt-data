The variable `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `c[i]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, particularly `dp` and `c`. However, based on the context, since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 30, `i` being 0 means that we are accessing the first index of the `dp` and `c` lists. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Thus, we can state that `dp[0]` changes based on the comparison with `c[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `i` is 0; `dp[0]` is updated to min(`dp[0]`, `c[0]`).**
