According to the provided code, the loop executes for values of `i` in the range from 1 to 30. The loop will iterate 30 times, starting from `i = 1` up to `i = 30`, inclusively. 

Since `n` is given to be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, and `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, the current value of `i` before the loop starts could range from `0` (when `n` is 1) to `29` (when `n` is 30). 

For the loop to execute at least once, it is sufficient that `i`'s initial value `n - 1` does not affect the conditions of the loop because the loop's range is predetermined (1 to 30). The key is that `dp[i]` has been updated previously based on the value of `c[i]`, which indicates that the `dp` array has the minimum values computed up to `n - 1`.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that:
- `i` should be in the bounds of the loop (from 1 to 30). Since `i` starts from `n - 1`, we need to adjust it for the loop's execution if needed.
- All variables necessary for the loop body are initialized correctly.

Given that `i` starts as `n-1`, we can conclude that it starts at `0` (when `n` is 1) and goes up to `29` (when `n` is 30). Hence, if the loop executes, it will iterate over `i` from 1 to 30. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp[i]` has been updated to min(`dp[i]`, `c[i]`) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `dp` contains minimum values from `c` for the first `n` indices; `i` is now 1 (if the loop body needs it for the first iteration).**
