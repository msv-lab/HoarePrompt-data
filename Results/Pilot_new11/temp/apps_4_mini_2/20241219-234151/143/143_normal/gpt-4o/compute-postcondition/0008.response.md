The code snippet `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])` updates the value of `dp` at index `i` based on the minimum of its current value and the value at index `i` in the array `c`. The value of `i` is given as 2, so the expression will evaluate `dp[2]` with `c[2]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 < `n` â‰¤ 30, `i` is 2, `dp[2]` is updated to min(`dp[2]`, `c[2]`)**.
