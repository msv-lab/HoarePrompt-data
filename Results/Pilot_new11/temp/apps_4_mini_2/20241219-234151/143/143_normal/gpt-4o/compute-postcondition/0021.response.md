The code `current_cost += dp[i]` updates the variable `current_cost` by adding the value of `dp[i]`, where `i` is currently 30. The value of `dp[i]` is initialized and can be any value based on the specific initialization for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`. Thus, `current_cost` will be increased by that specific value. The other variables including `n`, `answer`, and `L` remain unchanged.

So, the output state will reflect the updated value of `current_cost` while keeping the rest of the initial conditions intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[30]`, `i` is 30, and `L` is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `i` (L >= 1 << i).**
