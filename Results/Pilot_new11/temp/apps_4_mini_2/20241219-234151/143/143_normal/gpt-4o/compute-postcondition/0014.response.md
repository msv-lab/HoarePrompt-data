According to the code, the loop continues executing as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, 31)`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` needs to be less than 30. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `i` is 2,
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, which does not affect the loop directly since it is not referenced in the loop's control structure. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `n` will still remain within the provided constraints. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 3. The only change is the incrementing of `i`, which is now 3, while `n` remains as it was, and it must still be a positive integer within the given range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is updated to min(`dp[1]`, `dp[0] * 2`), and `dp[2]` is updated to min(`dp[2]`, `dp[1] * 2`)**
