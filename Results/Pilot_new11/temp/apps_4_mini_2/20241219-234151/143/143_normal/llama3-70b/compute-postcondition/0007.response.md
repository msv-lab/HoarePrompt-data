Postcondition: ***`n` is any integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `dp` is a list of integers with `L + 1` elements, where dp[0] is 0 and other elements are float('inf'), `i` is 1, `vol` is equal to \(2^j - 1\), and the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.***
