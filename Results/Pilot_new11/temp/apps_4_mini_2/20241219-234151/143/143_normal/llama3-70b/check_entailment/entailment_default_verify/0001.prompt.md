You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it against the problem description and examine several potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade given `n` different types of bottles, where each type `i` has a volume of `2^i - 1` liters and costs `c_i` roubles. We need to consider all possible volumes up to `L` and find out how to achieve at least `L` liters for the minimum cost.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program effectively uses dynamic programming to store the minimum cost for every possible volume from `0` to `L`.
2. It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the minimum cost needed to achieve exactly `i` liters.
3. For each liter count `i`, it checks each bottle type to see if it can be used to achieve that desired volume and updates the minimum cost accordingly.
4. If it's impossible to reach `L` liters, `dp[L]` remains `float('inf')`.

### Validating Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Values**:
   Input: `1 1` and `1`
   This requires confirming if the program can handle the smallest inputs correctly.

2. **Output when only one type of bottle suffices**:
   Input: `1 10` and `1`
   Check if buying 10 liters with a bottle costing 1 works correctly.

3. **Condition where it's more cost-effective to buy a larger bottle**:
   Input: `4 3` with costs `[10, 100, 200, 500]`.
   The program should correctly determine that buying the largest available bottle (8 liters) for 10 roubles is cheapest.

4. **Inability to reach `L`**:
   Input: `4 15` and costs `[10, 100, 200, 500]`. The program should not return a valid answer (should return `-1` or the equivalent).

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   Regular checks for larger volumes such as exceeding the limits to ensure it computes the minimum possible expenditures correctly. Inputs like `4 16 20 30 70 90` need to be validated for correct minimum cost calculation.

### Discovering Edge Cases:
The core logic of the dynamic programming approach appears sound. However, the code doesn't currently account for scenarios where the total required liters exceed the maximum achievable volume considering the volumes of the bottles:
- For `n = 1`, if `L = 1` and `c = [10]`, it applies well.
- For `n = 30`, although possible combinations can create different outputs, the logic might get inefficient or miscalculate total costs based on negative achievements.

### Final Evaluation:
After examining the program closely and considering various edge cases, no specific case has been found that would expose a flaw in its execution. The program logic maintains the correct flow and returns expected outputs as per the description.

Thus, based on this examination:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost to purchase at least `L` liters of lemonade based on the description provided.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes input values for `n` (number of cost entries) and `L` (target volume). It then builds a dynamic programming list, `dp`, where each index represents the minimum cost to reach that volume using a defined set of volume values derived from powers of 2 (specifically, `2^j - 1` for each `j` in `0` to `n-1`). The function ultimately outputs the minimum cost to achieve exactly volume `L`, or `-1` if it is impossible to reach that volume given the costs and available entries. It is important to note that if no valid volume combination can accumulate to `L`, the output will be `-1`. Moreover, the function lacks explicit input validation for the specified ranges of `n`, `L`, and cost values, which could lead to undefined behavior if invalid inputs are supplied.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
