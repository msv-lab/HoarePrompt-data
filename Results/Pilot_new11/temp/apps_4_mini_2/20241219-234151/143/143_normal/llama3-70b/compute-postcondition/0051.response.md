The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates on certain constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and the costs list `c` contains `n` integers where each `c[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ 10^9. 

The specific output behavior of the function is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot define precise return values or conditions based on the parameters without additional output specifications.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and depends on internal variables or state defined by the constraints provided, but the exact return values or outputs based on those constraints are not specified.**
