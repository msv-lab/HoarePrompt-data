In the provided code snippet, `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. The initial state includes `j` being equal to `2`. Therefore, we can calculate the value of `vol` as follows:

- `j` is `2`, so `2 ** j` equals `2 ** 2`, which is `4`.
- Subsequently, `vol` is updated to `4 - 1`, which results in `3`.

The variable `n` remains within the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, but its value is not explicitly affected by the code. Therefore, while `j` remains `2`, the variable `vol` changes from `1` to `3`.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3**
