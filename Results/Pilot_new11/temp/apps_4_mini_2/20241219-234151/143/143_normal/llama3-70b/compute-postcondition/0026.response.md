The variable `vol` is assigned the value `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is currently `1`, we calculate `vol` as follows: `vol = 2 ** 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**.
