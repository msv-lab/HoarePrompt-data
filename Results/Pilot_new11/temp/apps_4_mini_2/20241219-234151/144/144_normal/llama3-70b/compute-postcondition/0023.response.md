The code snippet consists of a `print` statement for `mex`, which means it will output the current value of `mex`. The value of `mex` is determined by the prior state of `arr` and its defined conditions.

Given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` is a sorted list containing integers, and `mex` is defined as the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`, we must consider the behavior of `mex` based on `arr`.

If the loop (which presumably determines the value of `mex`) did not execute, `mex` would remain 1. If the loop executed at least once, `mex` could have been incremented based on the contents of `arr` up to the largest consecutive integer present in it.

Since we are simply printing `mex`, the output does not change the programâ€™s state for `n`, `a`, or `arr`, but reflects the final value of `mex`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `mex` has been printed, retaining its last computed value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `a` is a list of integers; `arr` is a sorted list containing integers; `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`, printed as its final value.**
