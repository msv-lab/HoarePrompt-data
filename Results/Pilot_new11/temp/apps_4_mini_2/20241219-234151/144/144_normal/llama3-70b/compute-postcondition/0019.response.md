The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 more integers, `mex` is 2, `num` will be the next integer in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
