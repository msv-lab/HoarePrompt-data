According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `arr` list. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions stated that `mex` is currently 1, and if `num` was equal to 2 in the previous iteration, `mex` would have been incremented to 2. 

For the next iteration to occur, `num` must be taken from `arr`, which contains at least one integer, allowing the loop to proceed with the next element in the list. After the current value of `num`, which could be either equal to `mex` (1 or 2) or greater than `mex` (potentially breaking out of the loop), the next value of `num` will determine the conditions. 

Since `arr` contains at least one integer, which may not have been processed yet, the next `num` must be identified. If `num` is still valid, `mex` increments or program continues based on its value being checked against the current `mex`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 integers, and `mex` is 2, with `num` being the next integer in `arr`.**
