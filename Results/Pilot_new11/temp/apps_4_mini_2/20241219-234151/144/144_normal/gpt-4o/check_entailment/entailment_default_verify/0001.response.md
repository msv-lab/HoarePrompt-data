Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately captures the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code. The breakdown of the program's functionality aligns with the requirements of the task, which specifies the computation of the maximum possible value of `mex` from an array of positive integers.

1. **Input Handling**: The function appropriately reads the integer input and constructs the list of integers from it, adhering to the constraints of the problem.

2. **Sorting**: The sorting step simplifies the process of calculating the smallest missing positive integer. 

3. **Mex Calculation**: The loop iterates through the sorted list, incrementing the `mex` variable. The logic ensures that it correctly identifies which integers (from 1 upwards) are present in the list and determines the first that is absent.

4. **Output**: The printed result accurately reflects the computed `mex`, covering the range from 1 to `n + 1` as expected.

Also, the output hints support the functionality of the program and reinforce that it adheres to the constraints dictated by the problem description. Given that all provided examples and potential edge cases have been accounted for, the conclusion drawn in the original assessment remains valid. Thus, the program correctly implements the solution for the maximum possible value of `mex`.

Therefore, the program is verified as correct according to the requirements and conditions provided, leading to the determination of Final: **True**.
