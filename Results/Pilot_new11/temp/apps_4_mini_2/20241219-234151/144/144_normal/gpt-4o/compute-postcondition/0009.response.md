`mex` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `mex` is unknown. The variables `a` (a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order), `n` (greater than or equal to 2), and `num` (the second element in the list `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, and `mex` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `mex` is increased by 1**.
