The code simply prints the value of `mex`. Since there are no assignments or changes to any variables, the previous state remains unchanged apart from the output operation. Therefore, the value of `mex` will be printed as it is, but the other variables retain their initial characteristics.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order, with `n` being within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in list `a` and is printed.**
