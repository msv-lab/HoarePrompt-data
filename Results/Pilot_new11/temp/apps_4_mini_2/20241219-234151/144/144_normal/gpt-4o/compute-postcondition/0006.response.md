The `mex` variable is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `num` is the first element in the list `a`, which is sorted in ascending order with `n` positive integers, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. Thus, the value of `mex` will now be one greater than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, `mex` is incremented by 1**.
