The variable `my` is assigned the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The values of `cy` and `dx` remain the same, and `d2`, `d`, `cx`, `dy`, `mx`, and `count`, and other variables also stay unchanged, as they do not affect this calculation. 

Output State: **`count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` based on the distance condition; `j` is `i + 1; `N` is greater than `i + 1; `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2); `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to `(dx * dx + dy * dy); `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2.**
