You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a list of meat tuples (`meats`), each tuple consisting of two integer coordinates and an integer hardness value, as well as an integer `K` (indicating a threshold count) and a float `T` (which acts as a distance threshold). It attempts to evaluate pairs of meats to determine if there exists at least one pair for which the calculated combined properties (like distance and hardness interactions) yield a central point from which at least `K` meats are within the threshold distance `T`. If such a pair is found, the function returns True; otherwise, after checking all pairs and finding no valid condition, it returns False. If there are no meats provided (i.e., `N` is 0), the loop does not execute, and it directly returns False, maintaining the initial state of variables. The comments on postconditions may suggest various situations where the return could be True, but only the valid conditions checked in the code determine the actual behavior.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    (low, high) = (0, 1000000000.0)
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return high
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, a positive integer representing the number of available meats; `K`, a positive integer representing the number of meats to select; and `meats`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers that specify the coordinates and a value associated with each piece of meat. The function conducts a binary search within a specified range, adjusting the bounds (`low` and `high`) based on the results of the `func_1` evaluation with respect to `K` and a midpoint value `mid`. The loop continues until `low` and `high` are within a very small tolerance (1e-07). Finally, the function returns `high`, which indicates the upper boundary of the last successful evaluation of `func_1` for the meat selection problem. Notably, while the logic for selecting the meats is accurately iterated in the binary search, any potential edge cases that may arise from invalid inputs or edge conditions in the `func_1` evaluation are not explicitly handled within this function. If `func_1` fails for all iterations, `high` will reflect a scenario very close to an arbitrary high limit rather than a definitive meaningful outcome regarding meat selection.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        index += 3
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads input data to populate a list of meat pieces, where each piece is represented by its coordinates (x, y) and a hardness value (c). It expects the first two values from the input to indicate the number of pieces `N` and a selection limit `K`. After constructing the list of tuples `meats`, it calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `N`, `K`, and the `meats` list to obtain a result. This result, which is presumably a calculated value based on those inputs, is printed formatted to six decimal places. Note that the function assumes the input format does not contain any errors (i.e., it expects properly formatted integers) and does not handle edge cases such as invalid input or unexpected behavior if `N` or `K` do not conform to the specified constraints.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
