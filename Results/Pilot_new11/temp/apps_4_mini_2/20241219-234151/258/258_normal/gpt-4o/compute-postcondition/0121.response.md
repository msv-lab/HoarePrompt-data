Postcondition: ***`count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` based on the distance condition, `j` is `i + 1`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the original values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` respectively, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the original values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` respectively.***
