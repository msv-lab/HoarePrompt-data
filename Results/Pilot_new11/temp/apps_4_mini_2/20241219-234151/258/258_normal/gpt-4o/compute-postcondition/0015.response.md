The code appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are derived from `data[6]`, `data[7]`, and `data[8]`, respectively, which are all integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `meats` will now include the new tuple `(x, y, c)` in addition to its previous content.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is now a list containing the existing tuples and the new tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 6, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[7])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[8])`**.
