Output State: **`d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2` retain their previous values; `count` is the sum of the `c` values from `meats`; `N` is greater than `i + 2` and `j` is set to `i + 2`; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned from `meats[i]`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned from `meats[j]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.**
