Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `(1/4) * ((x1 - x2)`. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, then this condition holds true and the state of the program reflects this relationship.***
