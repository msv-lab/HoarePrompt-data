The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a new tuple containing the values of `x`, `y`, and `c` to the `meats` list. The variables `x`, `y`, and `c` have been previously set using elements from the `data` list at the specified indices (10, 11, and 12). The initial state of the program indicates that `meats` already contains existing tuples, and now it will contain one additional tuple.

The output state will retain the conditions related to `N`, `K`, and the existing state of `meats` while including the new tuple. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 2; `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive); `meats` now contains the existing tuples and a new tuple `(x, y, c)`; `index` is 10; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[12])`.**
