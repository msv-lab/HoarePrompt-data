Output State: **`d` is the result of the computations based on the last tuples in `meats`; `cx` and `cy` are the average of the coordinates from the last two tuples in `meats`; `dx` and `dy` are half the differences of the respective coordinates from the last two tuples; `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples; `count` is calculated as the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within the threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`). If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0, and `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain undefined values.**
