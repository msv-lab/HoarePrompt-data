Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples `(x, y, c)` extracted from `data`, `index` is `2 + (3 * N)`, `last x` is `int(data[3 * N + 2])`, `last y` is `int(data[3 * N + 3])`, `last c` is `int(data[3 * N + 4])`, `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(N, K, meats)`.**
