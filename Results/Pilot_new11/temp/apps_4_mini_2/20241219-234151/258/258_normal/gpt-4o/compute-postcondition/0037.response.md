The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The precondition indicates that `cy` will be updated with this new value based on the values of `y1` and `y2`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `d`, `my`, `count`, `j`, `N`, `cx`, and any ambient values (like `c1`, `c2`, `T`, `x1`, `x2`, `K`, and `i` where relevant) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `cy`.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` retain their previous states; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * (c1 * T - c2 * T) - (c1 * T - c2 * T) * (c1 * T - c2 * T)) / d2; `count` is assigned the sum of valid conditions from meats and `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` must be greater than `i + 2; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.**
