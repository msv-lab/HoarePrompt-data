The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 2])`. Given that `index` is equal to `2`, `index + 2` equals `4`. Therefore, `c` becomes the integer value of `data[4]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.**
