The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. 

- `N` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat.
- `K` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq K \leq N \).
- `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \( (x_i, y_i, c_i) \) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, with the constraints: \( -1000 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 1000 \) and \( 1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \).

The function returns a value based on the given inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. However, it processes the input parameters according to the described constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (positive integer), K (positive integer where 1 <= K <= N), and meats (a list of tuples containing coordinates and hardness), and returns a value based on the input parameters.**
