Output State: **If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is negative, equal to (c1 * T - c2 * T); `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2; `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `count` is less than K; `i` is N - 1; `j` is N; `d2` is defined and equal to (x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) / 4 + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2) / 4.**
