The code assigns a new value to `y` based on the expression `int(data[index + 1])`, where `index` is currently 6. Consequently, `y` will be set to the integer value found in the `data` list at position `index + 1` (which is 7). This change only affects the variable `y`, while all other variables retain their previous states. Thus, the output state will specify the updated value of `y`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is now a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 6, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[7])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[4])**.
