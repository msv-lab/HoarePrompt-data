Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`. If `d` is negative, the program skips the current iteration of the loop while maintaining the values of `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2`, where `cx` is the average of the last two x-coordinates `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is the average of the last two y-coordinates `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, along with `count` being the sum of the `c` values from `meats` where `math.sqrt((mx - x) < K)`, while ensuring that `N` is greater than `i + 2` and `j` is set to `i + 2`, with `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` assigned from `meats[i]`, and `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` assigned from `meats[j]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.*
