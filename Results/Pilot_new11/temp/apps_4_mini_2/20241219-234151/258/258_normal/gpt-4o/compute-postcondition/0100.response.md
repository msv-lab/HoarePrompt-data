Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to the previous value of `d` divided by `c1 * c2`. `cx` is the average of the last two x-coordinates `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is the average of the last two y-coordinates `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` where `math.sqrt((mx - x) < K)`. `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned from `meats[i]`, while `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned from `meats[j]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.***
