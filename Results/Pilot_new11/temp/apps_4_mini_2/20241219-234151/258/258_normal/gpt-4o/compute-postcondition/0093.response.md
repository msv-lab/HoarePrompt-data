Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to the previous value of `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `cx` is the average of the last two x-coordinates `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is the average of the last two y-coordinates `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` where `math.sqrt((mx - x)`, and the current value of `count` is greater than or equal to `K`.***
