You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description regarding grilling pieces of meat, let’s analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(meats, K, T)`**:
    - The function iterates through all pairs of meat pieces. For each pair, it calculates a mid-point and attempts to find a point `(mx, my)` such that enough pieces can be cooked within time `T`.
    - The conditions and math implemented seem to implement a geometric approach to resolve the meat grilling problem by referencing how far the heat acts on the pieces of meat (using their hardness).

2. **Function `func_2(N, K, meats)`**:
    - This function attempts to find the minimal time required using binary search over the time `T`.
    - The loop continues until the potential difference between `low` and `high` is very small (`1e-07`), ensuring a high precision in the output.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
    - This function handles input parsing and directly ties the functions together to produce an output.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The code seems to rely heavily on the calculation involving `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, and relies on careful handling of distances and midpoints.
- A potential issue could arise if it misses cases where meat pieces are at extreme coordinates but possess high hardness. The precision in determining `(mx, my)` may not accurately reflect the optimal heat point for every potential configuration of meat pieces under varying `T`.
- The given boundaries of the problem and constraints are all respected, but without testing the specific input values and configurations, it’s difficult to assert that it functions correctly under all conditions specified.

### Test Input Example:
One example to consider is if:
```plaintext
N = 3, K = 2
-1000 0 1
0 1000 1
0 -1000 1
```
- Here, the pieces of meat are spread widely, and all have the same hardness. The function should ideally locate an efficient point for grilling.

### Conclusion:
- After examining the logic, while it aims to capture pivotal cases through calculations of `(mx, my)`, it could still falter on edge cases that involve extreme values or specifically arranged meat coordinates affecting how heat disperses due to corresponding hardness.

Thus, given the potential edge cases and the complexity of geometric placements versus hardness:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

When the loop terminates, `high` and `low` are within 1e-07 of each other, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high` just before the loop ends, and the values of `low` and `high` reflect the bounds of the last successful evaluation of `func_1(meats, K, mid)`. If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` was ever true, `low` remains at 0 or adjusts accordingly, and if false, it updates to reflect the previous value of `mid` before the final iteration, while both `low` and `high` approach the final `mid` value very closely.
