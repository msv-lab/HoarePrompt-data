To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we need to analyze the impact of the snippet on the pre-existing variables.

### Variables prior to execution:
- `d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is equal to `(1/4) * (x1 - x2)`
- `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`

### Statement:
```
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

### Analyzing the code:
- `my` is assigned the value of `cy` minus the expression `dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- We can substitute the expressions for `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` directly into the equation for `my`.

This keeps the initial information of the other variables unchanged while updating `my`.

### Updated Variables:
- `my = (y1 + y2) / 2 - ((x1 - x2) / 2) * math.sqrt((1/4) * (x1 - x2) * ((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2))) - ((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)) * ((1/4) * (x1 - x2)) ) / ((1/4) * (x1 - x2))`

### Output State:
No other variables are affected, so we simply include the update for `my` while retaining the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(1/4) * (x1 - x2)`, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2 - ((x1 - x2) / 2) * math.sqrt((1/4) * (x1 - x2) * ((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2))) - ((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)) * ((1/4) * (x1 - x2))) / ((1/4) * (x1 - x2))**
