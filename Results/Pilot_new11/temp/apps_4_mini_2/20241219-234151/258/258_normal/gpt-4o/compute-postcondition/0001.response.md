Output State: **`N` is the input integer from `data[0]`, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) with constraints -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100; `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
