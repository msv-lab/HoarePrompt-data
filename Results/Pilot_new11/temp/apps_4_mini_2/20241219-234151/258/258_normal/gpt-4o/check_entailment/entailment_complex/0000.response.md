Correctness: **False**

The main issue with the code is in the way the function `func_1` calculates whether there exists a point from which K or more pieces of meat are ready to eat within a threshold time T. The logic seems to be attempting to find pairs of meats and calculating some average point, but it may not correctly handle all edge cases.

1. The check for `count` in `func_1` depends heavily on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T`. This approach calculates whether each piece of meat can be ready within time T based on the hardness and the distance from the calculated midpoint (mx, my). However, there can be circumstances where the optimal placement of the heat source is not captured by merely evaluating pairs of meats, as the best point to place the heat source may not be on the line segment between any two pieces of meat.

2. Specifically, for certain distributions of meat coordinates and hardness levels, it is possible that the midpoints calculated do not cover scenarios where the best solution could come from a non-paired configuration. For instance, when the target number of meats K is close to N, and they are positioned such that the best heat source position is outside the midpoints of any pairs, the algorithm may fail to identify the correct minimum time.

3. Furthermore, the while loop in `func_2` continues until `high - low > 1e-07`, which is numerically precise but does not guarantee that the answer is indeed capturing potential heat source placements adequately, as it relies heavily on the results produced by `func_1`.

Given these considerations, there are potential cases where the algorithm will fail to return the correct minimum time required when trying to grill K pieces of meat, which does not align with the problem's requirements. Thus, the program is not fully correct or robust for every edge case described in the problem statement.
