According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `y`, which is iterating from -1000 to 1000. In the previous iteration, `y` was -1000, and the loop iterates by increasing `y` by 1 at each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. To execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented to -999. The loop will continue executing until `y` reaches 1000. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- The variable `y` will be updated to -999 for the next iteration.
- The values of `N`, `K`, `times`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is sorted; `ans` is updated to the minimum of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]`; `x` is 1001; `y` is -999**
