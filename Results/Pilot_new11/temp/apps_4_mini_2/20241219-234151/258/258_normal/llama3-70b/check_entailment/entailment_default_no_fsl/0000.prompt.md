You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
Functions with output description for each function:
import math

(N, K) = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    (x, y, c) = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3())

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two integer coordinates (x, y) representing the position of a piece of meat and two real number coordinates (X, Y) representing the position of a heat source. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the heat source and the piece of meat using the formula `math.sqrt((X - x)
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [c * func_1(x, y, X, Y) for (x, y, c) in meats]
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts real numbers `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which are coordinates in a two-dimensional plane. It also uses a global list of tuples called `meats`, where each tuple consists of `x_i`, `y_i` coordinates and an integer `c_i` representing the hardness of each piece of meat. The function returns a list where each element is the product of the hardness `c_i` of each piece of meat and the output of a separate function `func_1(x, y, X, Y)`. This indicates that the function assumes `func_1` is defined elsewhere and returns a numerical value based on the provided coordinates. The sensitivity of the function to the global state of `meats`, as well as the reliance on `func_1`, means that edge cases related to missing or improperly defined `meats` or `func_1` may result in errors or unexpected results. Notably, the function does not handle empty lists of `meats`, nor does it check if `func_1` returns a valid, expected value for computation, which could lead to runtime exceptions in such scenarios.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
    return ans
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function evaluates all integer coordinates `(x, y)` within the range of -1000 to 1000, calls another function `func_2` for each coordinate pair with the same point as both the start and end points, sorts the resulting list of times, and identifies the minimum time value corresponding to the `K`-th position in this sorted list across all evaluated coordinates. The function ultimately returns this minimum value. It does not take any parameters and its return value encapsulates the minimum of the times collected from all evaluated coordinates, specifically focusing on the `K-th` index of the sorted outputs. Edge cases could include scenarios where `K` is at its bounds (1 or N), but these are handled by the logic of selecting the `K - 1` index in a sorted list. However, if `func_2` does not behave as expected or does not return a sorted list of sufficient length, this could lead to unexpected results, although those scenarios are not explicitly addressed within the provided code.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
