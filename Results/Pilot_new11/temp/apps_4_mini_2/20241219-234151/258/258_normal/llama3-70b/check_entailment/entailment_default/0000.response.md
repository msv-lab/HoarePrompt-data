To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description and output hints, we will analyze each function and see if they accomplish the task as expected.

**Problem Description Summary:**
Takahashi wants to find out the time required to grill K pieces of meat based on their coordinates and hardness by placing a heat source optimally.

**Function 1: `func_1`**
```python
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
```
**Output Hints:**
The function calculates the Euclidean distance between a heat source and a piece of meat based on their coordinates. This appears to be correct in functionality.

**Function 2: `func_2`**
```python
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [c * func_1(x, y, X, Y) for (x, y, c) in meats]
```
**Output Hints:**
This function calculates the time required for each piece of meat based on its hardness and the distance to the heat source. While it relies on a global variable `meats`, there is no explicit handling of edge cases such as an empty `meats` list. However, as per the problem description, we are told that the input will be valid, so we will assume this is acceptable.

**Function 3: `func_3`**
```python
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
    return ans
```
**Output Hints:**
This function evaluates all potential coordinates for placing the heat source, calculates the corresponding grilling times, sorts them, and finds the minimum time to have at least K pieces ready. However, it does not adequately ensure that the list `times` has enough elements before accessing `times[K-1]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Edge Case Handling:** The code does not account for the case when K is equal to N. Specifically, it would attempt to access times[K-1] which might result in an IndexError if many pieces are unavailable due to unsorted times. However, based on the provided constraints (and given valid inputs), there will always be enough times if there are N pieces and K <= N.

2. **Validating All Scenarios:** The function iterates through a fixed grid of integer coordinates from -1000 to 1000, which comprehensively covers the valid domain for the heat source. It ensures that it evaluates every scenario for potential optimal placement of the heat source.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints, all functions appear to work correctly based on the problem's expectations and handle the provided inputs as specified. The program's logic adheres to the problem description, and functional dependencies are all addressed as they should be under the assumption of valid inputs.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **True**.
