To determine the output state after the execution of the given Python code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the effect of the executed code. 

Initial State: 
- `N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` contains a minimum value
- `y` is -1000

The code snippet provided is:
```
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

However, since we do not have the actual implementation or behavior of the function `func_2`, we cannot ascertain the resultant value of `times`. It is assumed that `func_2` processes the parameters `x` and `y`, but without knowing its implementation, we cannot derive a specific value.

Since `x` is not mentioned in the initial state but it is passed to the function, we cannot update its value or whether it holds a valid value. As a result, `x` remains unspecified. `y` remains unchanged at -1000 as it is only being passed and not modified.

Given that no direct value updates are made to `N`, `K`, `ans`, or an input-related variable, the output state reflects the unchanged aspects except for the assignment of `times` to the result of the function. Thus, we indicate that `times` has been assigned but leave it unspecified.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` contains a minimum value; `y` is -1000; `times` is assigned the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.**
