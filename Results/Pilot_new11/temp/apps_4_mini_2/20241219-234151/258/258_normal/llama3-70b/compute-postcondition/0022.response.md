The `times` list is sorted in ascending order, which modifies its order based on the values it contains. The values of `N`, `K`, `ans`, `y`, and the result of `func_2` remain unaffected by this sorting operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the sorted state of `times`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` is updated to be min(`ans`, `times[K - 1]`); `y` is -999; `times` is sorted.**
