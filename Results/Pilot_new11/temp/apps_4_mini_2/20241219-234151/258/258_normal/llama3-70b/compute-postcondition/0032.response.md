The variable `times` is sorted in ascending order. The initial values of `times` were determined by executing the function `func_2(1001, -1000, 1001, -1000)`. However, the specific contents of `times` before sorting are unknown, but we know it will have `N` elements since `K` is in the range of 1 to `N`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is sorted; `ans` is the minimum value of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]; x` is 1001; `y` is -1000.**
