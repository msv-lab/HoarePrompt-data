According to the code, the loop defined by `for y in range(-1000, 1001)` is set to iterate over all integer values from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). The variable `y` will take on each of these values during the iterations. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed for `y` equal to the last value, which is 1000. Therefore, to execute the loop again, `y` must be updated to the next value in the range. However, since 1000 is the last value in that range, the loop will no longer execute.

To summarize the states:
- The range for `y` allows values from -1000 to 1000, and since `y` has reached 1000, the loop will not continue to execute again.

Thus, `y` cannot be incremented further to allow a next iteration. The state remains unchanged in terms of looping, but we highlight relevant variables accordingly.

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is sorted; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]; y` has reached 1000 and cannot be incremented further**
