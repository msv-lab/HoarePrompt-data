The variable `times` is assigned the value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `y` is -999. The implementation of `func_2` is not described, so its impact on the final value of `times` is unknown. However, it is specified that `times` will be sorted after the assignment. The initial state of `times` reflects its value after being processed by `func_2`.

The state of the other variables remains the same. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` is updated to be min(`ans`, `times[K - 1]`); `y` is -999; `times` is assigned the result of `func_2(x, -999, x, -999)` and sorted.**
