The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value at index `K - 1` of the sorted list `times`. The specific value of `times[K - 1]` is taken directly from the list, and since `K` is a non-negative integer within the constraints, the output state will reflect the changes accordingly.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` is updated to be min(`ans`, `times[K - 1]`); `y` is -998; `times` is now sorted.**
