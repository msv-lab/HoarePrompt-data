The operation `times.sort()` modifies the list `times` by sorting its values in ascending order. The initial conditions state that `times` has been assigned the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, though we do not know the specific values in `times` beyond it being an array or list of some form. 

Post-sorting, the variable `times` will be in a sorted order but the variable `ans` remains unchanged, as the sort operation does not impact it. The values of `N`, `K`, and `y` also remain unaffected since the sort operation only pertains to the list `times`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `y` has reached 1000 and cannot be incremented further; `times` is sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `y` has reached 1000 and cannot be incremented further; `times` is sorted in ascending order.**
