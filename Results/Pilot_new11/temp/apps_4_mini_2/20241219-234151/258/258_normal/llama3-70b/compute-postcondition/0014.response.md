Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` contains the minimum of the `times[K - 1]` values across all `y` values from -1000 to 1000, and `y` has iterated through all values from -1000 to 1000.**
