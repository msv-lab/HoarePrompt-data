The variable `times` is assigned the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The values of `x` and `y` are used as arguments for this function call, but the actual values of `times` after the function execution depend on the implementation of `func_2`, which is not provided. However, `y` is currently -998, and it is also important to note that `times` is sorted.

Since the value of `times` is directly changed by the function `func_2`, and other variables remain unaffected, we cannot determine the specific values of `times` without the function's details, but we know that it has been updated. As for `ans`, it has not been directly modified in this code snippet, so the precondition remains valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` is updated to be min(`ans`, `times[K - 1]`); `y` is -998; `times` is the result of `func_2(x, -998, x, -998)` and is sorted.**
