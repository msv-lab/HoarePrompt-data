You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer between 1 and n, l is an integer between 1 and n, and r is an integer between l and n, representing the segment of tabs that need to remain open.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :
            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
                close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
                print(close_both_sides)
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` and is less than `n`. If `r` is equal to `n`, the output of the calculation is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which has been printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` which is not both equal to `1` and `n`, then the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which evaluates to an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l` is greater than 1, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` and less than `n`; if `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`, which has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. If `l` is 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the output is 0. If `l` equals 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is less than `n`, the values `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, and the value `close_both_sides` equals `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers from input: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to make a segment of tabs defined by indices `l` to `r` closed, based on the current position `pos`. The function handles special cases: if the entire range [1, n] is open, it prints 0; if only one end (either `l` or `r`) is at the bounds, it computes moves accordingly. For cases where both `l` and `r` are not on the edges, it calculates the moves required to close both ends of the segment and prints the minimum moves considering the distance to both edges. The output is always a non-negative integer, representing the number of actions needed to achieve the desired state.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
