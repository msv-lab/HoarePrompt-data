The code snippet `print(0)` outputs the value `0` to the console. There are no assignments or changes made to any of the variables in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; the current value of `l` is 1, and the current value of `r` is equal to `n`; output is 0.**
