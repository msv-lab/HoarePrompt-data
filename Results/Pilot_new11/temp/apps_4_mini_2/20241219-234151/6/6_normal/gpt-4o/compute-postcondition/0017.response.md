The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. Here are the details for each parameter:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, representing the segment of tabs that need to remain open.

Based on the output specifications, the function operates within the constraints of the input parameters and produces a result based on the selected segment of tabs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, and presumably returns a result that pertains to the segment of tabs indexed from l to r while considering the input constraints.**
