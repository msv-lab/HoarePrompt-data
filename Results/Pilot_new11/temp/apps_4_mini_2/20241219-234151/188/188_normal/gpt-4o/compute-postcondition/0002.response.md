`count` is assigned the value of `Counter(cards)`, where `Counter` is a collection that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `cards`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it still represents an even integer between 2 and 100. The variable `cards` is unchanged in its definition but is now represented by its counts in `count`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from user input; `count` is a Counter object representing counts of integers in `cards`.**
