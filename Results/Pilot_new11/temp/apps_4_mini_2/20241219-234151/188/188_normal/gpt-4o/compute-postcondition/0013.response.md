Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from user input; `count` is a Counter object representing counts of integers in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of keys from `count`. If `unique_numbers` has less than 2 elements, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the counts of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]` are both equal to `n // 2`, 'YES' is printed along with the values of `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
