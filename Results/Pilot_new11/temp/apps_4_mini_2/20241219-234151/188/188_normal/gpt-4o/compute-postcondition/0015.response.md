Functionality: **The function reads an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and `n` integers from user input, representing the values on cards. It counts the occurrences of each integer using a Counter and creates a sorted list of unique integers based on their counts. If there are fewer than 2 unique integers, it outputs 'NO'. If there are at least 2 unique integers, it checks if the two most frequently occurring integers both appear exactly `n // 2` times. If they do, it outputs 'YES' along with these two integers; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. If all conditions are followed, it does not return any value but rather prints the results based on the derived conditions. Missing functionality includes the absence of error handling for invalid inputs such as non-integer values or integers outside the specified range.**
