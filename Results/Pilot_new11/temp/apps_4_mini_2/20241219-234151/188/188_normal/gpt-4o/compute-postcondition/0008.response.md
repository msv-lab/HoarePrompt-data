The code simply prints 'YES', which does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from user input; `count` is a Counter object representing counts of integers in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of keys from `count` based on their values with a length of at least 2; the current value of `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` is equal to `n // 2`, and the current value of `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` is equal to `n // 2; 'YES' is printed.**
