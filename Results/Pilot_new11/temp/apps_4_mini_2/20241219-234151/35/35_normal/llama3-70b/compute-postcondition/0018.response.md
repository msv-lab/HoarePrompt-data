Functionality: **The function reads three integers, \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\), from user input. It determines the maximum number \(x\) of cake pieces that can be distributed such that there are enough pieces available from both cakes to satisfy the conditions: both cakes must have at least \(x\) pieces left after distribution, and the total remaining pieces after distribution must also be at least \(x\). The value \(x\) starts from the minimum of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) and decreases until these conditions are met or until \(x\) reaches zero. The function then outputs the determined value of \(x\**. 

**Note:** The function does not check for the validity of input values to ensure that \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) are within their specified ranges before processing. It may also handle the edge case in which \(n\) exceeds the total pieces available in \(a\) and \(b\), resulting in \(x\) being set to zero when no valid distribution can occur. The final output thus represents either the maximum number of pieces that can be fairly distributed according to the specified rules or zero if no distribution is possible.**
