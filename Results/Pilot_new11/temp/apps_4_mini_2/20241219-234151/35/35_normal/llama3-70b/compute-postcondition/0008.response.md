The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` and `b` are input integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, both within the range of 1 to 100; `x` is equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
