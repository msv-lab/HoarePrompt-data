Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` is an input integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100); `b` is an input integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100); `x` is equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`). Both `a` and `b` are greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of remaining pieces after taking `x` pieces from both cakes (which is `a - x` and `b - x`) is greater than or equal to `x`.***
