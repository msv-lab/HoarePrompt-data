Output State: **`low` is equal to `high` (which is min(a, b) + 1 if the loop exited without executing `can_distribute(mid)`), indicating the value that cannot be distributed further, while `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b; `mid` holds the last calculated midpoint value, depending upon the final evaluation of `can_distribute(mid)`; if the loop executed at least once and `can_distribute(mid)` returned true at least once, the last value of `low` will have been adjusted to one more than at least one of the `mid` values computed during the loop.**
