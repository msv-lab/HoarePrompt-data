According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. For the loop to execute one more time, `low` must be strictly less than `high`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b, but we do not have specific values for `low` and `high`.

Given that `low` is still strictly less than `high` at the end of the last iteration, it indicates that the loop can proceed without needing any adjustments. 

Thus, no states need to be modified or adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b**
