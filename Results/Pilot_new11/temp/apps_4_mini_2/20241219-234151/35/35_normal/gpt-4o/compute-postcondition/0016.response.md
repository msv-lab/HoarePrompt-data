In the given code snippet, `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. The variable `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, which implies that `mid` is an integer that represents the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. 

Since `high` is set to `mid`, the relationship between `high`, `low`, and `n` remains as follows:

- The definition of `mid` still is `(low + high) // 2`, where now `high` equals `mid`.
  
This means that `high` changes to the value of `mid`, and the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, we can conclude the impact of this operation on the overall state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2; `high` is equal to `mid`.**
