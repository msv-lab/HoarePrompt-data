To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to observe how the variables are affected during each iteration based on the operations in `ops`.

From the given information:
- `ux` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations.
- `uy` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations.
- `dx` is equal to `x - ux`.
- `dy` is equal to `y - uy`.
- `res` is initialized as 0 and there is at least one more operation remaining in `ops`.

During each iteration of the loop:
- If the current operation (`op`) is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, `dy` decreases by 1.
- If the current operation (`op`) is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, `dy` increases by 1.
- If the current operation (`op`) is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, `dx` decreases by 1.
- If the current operation (`op`) is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, `dx` increases by 1.
- In any other case, `dx` remains the same, `dy` remains the same, and `res` is set to 1, but since we have established that at least one operation remains in `ops`, `res` remains 0.

Given that there is still at least one operation left in `ops`, we must consider that after processing the last operation, we will prepare for a new operation.

Since we must ensure to reflect what happens to `dx` and `dy` based on the last operation in `ops`, we can summarize as follows. 

Assuming the last operation is `op`, following its effect on `dx` and `dy`:
- If `op` is 'U' and `dy` was greater than 0, then `dy` has been updated to `y - uy - 1`.
- If `op` is 'D' and `dy` was less than 0, then `dy` has been updated to `y - uy + 1`.
- If `op` is 'R' and `dx` was greater than 0, then `dx` has been updated to `x - ux - 1`.
- If `op` is 'L' and `dx` was less than 0, then `dx` has been updated to `x - ux + 1`.

Thus, at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop (to prepare for at least one more operation), we update the states accordingly depending on the last operation `op` and the conditions checked.

State: **`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is 0, with at least one more operation remaining in `ops`.**
