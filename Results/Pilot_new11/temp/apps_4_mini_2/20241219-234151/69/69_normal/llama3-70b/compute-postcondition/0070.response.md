Postcondition: ***`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is updated to `y - uy + 1`, while `dx`, `res`, and the presence of at least one more operation remaining in `ops` remain unchanged. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux - 1`, while `dy` remains `y - uy`, `res` remains 0, and there is at least one more operation remaining in `ops`. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`, `dy` remains `y - uy`, `res` remains 0, ensuring at least one more operation is still in `ops`. Otherwise, `dx` equals `x - ux`, `dy` equals `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, with at least one more operation remaining in `ops`.***
