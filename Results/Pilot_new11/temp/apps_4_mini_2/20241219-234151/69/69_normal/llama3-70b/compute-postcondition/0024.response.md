`ux` is decremented by 1. The variable `n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, and `op` is the second character of `ops`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the second character of `ops`, and `ux` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the second character of `ops`, `ux` is decreased by 1**
