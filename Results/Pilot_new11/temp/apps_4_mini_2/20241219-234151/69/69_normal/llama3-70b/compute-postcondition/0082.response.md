Output State: **`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `res` is the count of operations in `ops` that could not make a valid movement according to the conditions of the loop. If the loop does not execute, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `res` retain their initial calculated values based on `ops`.**
