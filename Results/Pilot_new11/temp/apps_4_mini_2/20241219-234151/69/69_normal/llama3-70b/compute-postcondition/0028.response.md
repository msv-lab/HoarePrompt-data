Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, and `op` is the second character of `ops`. If `op` is 'U', `uy` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `op` is 'D', `uy` is decreased by 1; if `op` is 'R', `ux` is increased by 1; if `op` is 'L', `ux` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `ux` remains unchanged.***
