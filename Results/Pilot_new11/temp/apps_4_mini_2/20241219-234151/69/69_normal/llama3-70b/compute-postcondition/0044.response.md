To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the following aspects:

1. The loop iterates over `ops`, so it is essential that `ops` has at least one character for the loop to run. This means `n`, the length of `ops`, must be greater than 0. 

2. The variables `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `res` will be adjusted according to the given conditions. Specifically, before the first iteration:
   - `ux` will be the result of counting 'R' characters minus the count of 'L' characters in `ops`.
   - `uy` will be the result of counting 'U' characters minus the count of 'D' characters in `ops`.
   - The values of `dx` and `dy` are then derived from `x - ux` and `y - uy`, respectively.
   
3. As we evaluate the states, we note that:
   - For the loop to begin executing, `ops` must not be an empty string, which implies that `n` must be greater than 0.

Now, synthesizing these points, our adjusted state must reflect that `n` is greater than 0 and that we have the initial values of `x` and `y` necessary to compute `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, and `dy`.

State: **`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `ops` must be a non-empty string of length greater than 0, `res` is 0**
