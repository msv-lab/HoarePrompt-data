`uy` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is greater than 0, and the `ops` string has a length of `n`. The value of `op` is the first character of `ops` and is equal to 'U'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is equal to 'U', and `uy` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is equal to 'U', `uy` is increased by 1**
