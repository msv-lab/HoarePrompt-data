`uy` is decremented by 1. The value of `uy` is not given explicitly in the initial state, but it is not affected by the other variables, so we only know its relationship with the other variables isn't changed. The states of the other variables remain the same. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the first character of `ops` which is not equal to 'U', the current value of `op` is 'D', and `uy` is reduced by 1.**
