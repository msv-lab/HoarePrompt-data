Postcondition: ***`ux` is the number of 'R' minus 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' minus 'D' in `ops`. If `op` is 'D' and `dy < 0`, then `dy` is updated to `y - uy + 1`, with `dx` remaining equal to `x - ux`, and `res` still equal to 0. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux - 1`, with `dy` remaining equal to `y - uy`, and `res` still equal to 0. If `op` is 'L' while `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`, with `dy` remaining equal to `y - uy`, and `res` remaining 0. Otherwise, `dx` remains `x - ux`, `dy` remains `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, with at least one operation remaining in `ops.***
