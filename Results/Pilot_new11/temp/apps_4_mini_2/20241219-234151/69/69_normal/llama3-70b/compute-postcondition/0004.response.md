According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `ops`, which is a string of length `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, meaning that `ops` should not be an empty string. Moreover, as the loop iterates, the variable `op` will take on values from the string `ops`. 

Before the loop starts, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to begin executing, and we also need to establish initial conditions for `op`.

So, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and initially, `op` would be the first character of the string `ops`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the first character of `ops`**
