The value of `ux` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than 1, `ops` continues to be a string of length `n`, and `op` remains the second character of `ops`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the second character of `ops`, and `ux` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the second character of `ops`, `ux` is increased by 1**
