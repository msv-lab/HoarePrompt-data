Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases outlined in the problem description. In particular, it fails to account for situations where there may be excess operations that cannot be adjusted to reach the desired (x, y) coordinate due to an incorrect management of the remaining movements (`dx` and `dy`). 

For example, consider the following case:

Input:
```
4
RUUL
0 1
```

- The given operations "RUUL" result in a position of (1, 2) after execution.
- The target position is (0, 1).
- The program incorrectly computes `dx` and `dy` as `0 - 1 = -1` and `1 - 2 = -1`, respectively, and outputs `-1` suggesting it's impossible to reach this position. 

However, it is actually possible to reach (0, 1) by changing, for example, the operations to "LUUL," which would require changing the first character and potentially others, leading to a valid solution.

Thus, because there are cases where the program will incorrectly conclude that the target is unreachable, it doesn't fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description and is therefore deemed incorrect.
