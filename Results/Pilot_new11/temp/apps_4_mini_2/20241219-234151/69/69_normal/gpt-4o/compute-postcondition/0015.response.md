Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial x-coordinate, and `y` is the initial y-coordinate. If the current operation `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is 0. Otherwise, if the current operation `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` remains 0.***
