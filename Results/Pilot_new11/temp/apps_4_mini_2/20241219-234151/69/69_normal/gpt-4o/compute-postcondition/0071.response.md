The variable `current_x` is incremented by 1, so its new value will be `current_x + 1`. The values of `final_x`, `final_y`, `n`, `i`, and `position_map` remain unchanged. 

Assuming `current_x` was initially unspecified but is now understood in the context of `position_map`, we can express the updated state as follows:

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 1, `position_map` now contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 1`, and `current_x` is now `current_x + 1`.**
