You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); operations is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'; x and y are integers with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `final_x` is the result of the net movements in the horizontal direction calculated as (number of 'R' - number of 'L'), `final_y` is the result of the net movements in the vertical direction calculated as (number of 'U' - number of 'D'), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`.
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if (dx == 0 and dy == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`final_x` is the result of the net movements in the horizontal direction calculated as (number of 'R' - number of 'L'); `final_y` is the result of the net movements in the vertical direction calculated as (number of 'U' - number of 'D'); `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); `operations` is a string of length `n`; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, indicating that there is a discrepancy between the target position and the calculated net movements in the horizontal and vertical directions.
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        
        target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy
        
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `final_x` is the result of net movements (number of 'R' - number of 'L'), `final_y` is the result of net movements (number of 'U' - number of 'D'), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `min_length` is the minimum length of the sequences found that return to the same position (if no such sequence is found, it remains positive infinity), `current_x` is the horizontal position after processing all movements, `current_y` is the vertical position after processing all movements, and `position_map` contains all the positions encountered during the movements with their corresponding indices.
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
    #The program returns min_length if it is not positive infinity; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating whether a sequence of movements exists that returns to the same position.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 200000), a string `operations` of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y` (with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9). It processes the `operations` string to calculate net movements in both horizontal (`final_x`) and vertical (`final_y`) directions. Initially, it checks if the calculated position `(final_x, final_y)` matches the target position `(x, y)`, returning 0 if they match. If not, it seeks the shortest substring of movements that returns to the starting position by maintaining a mapping of visited positions and their indices. The function then returns the minimum length of such a substring if found; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate no such sequence exists. The function thus determines whether the movements can return to an original position and provides the length of the shortest such sequence. Edge cases include handling a zero-length `operations` string (though `n` is constrained), and scenarios where no valid return path exists, resulting in a return value of -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
