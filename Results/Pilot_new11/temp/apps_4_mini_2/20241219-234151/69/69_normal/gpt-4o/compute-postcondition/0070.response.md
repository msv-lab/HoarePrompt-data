The variable `current_x` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `current_x` is unknown. As `final_x` and `final_y` are not affected by this operation, nor are `n` and `i`, the output state focuses on the change in `current_x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 1, and `position_map` now contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 1-1 = 0`, where `current_x` has decreased by 1.
