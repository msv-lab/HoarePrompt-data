The variable `current_x` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions state that `final_x` and `final_y` are results of net movements, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. Since there are no changes to `final_x`, `final_y`, `n`, or `i`, the output state reflects only the updated value of `current_x`.

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `current_x` is increased by 1**.
