The value of `current_x` is decremented by 1. The values of `final_x` and `final_y` remain unaffected, as they are the results of net movements. Additionally, the relationship between `n` and `i` remains valid since the code execution does not alter those variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `final_x` and `final_y` have their previous values, and `current_x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements; `current_x` is decreased by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1**.
