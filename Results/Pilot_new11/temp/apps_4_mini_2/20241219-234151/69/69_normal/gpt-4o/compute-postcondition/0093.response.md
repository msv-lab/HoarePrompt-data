Output State: **`final_x` is the result of net movements (number of 'R' - number of 'L'), `final_y` is the result of net movements (number of 'U' - number of 'D'), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `min_length` is the minimum length of the sequences found that return to the same position (if no such sequence is found, it remains positive infinity), `current_x` is the horizontal position after processing all movements, `current_y` is the vertical position after processing all movements, and `position_map` contains all the positions encountered during the movements with their corresponding indices.**
