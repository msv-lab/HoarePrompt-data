The code `current_y -= 1` decrements the value of `current_y` by 1. There will be no effect on the other variables `final_x`, `final_y`, `n`, `i`, and `position_map`, which remain unchanged. 

Since `current_y`'s previous value is undefined in the provided initial state, we only note that it is decremented. This gives us:

- `current_y` is now one less than its previous value.

With this in mind, the output retains all valid information from the initial state while including the change to `current_y`. 

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 1, `position_map` now contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 1, current_y is now one less than its previous value.**
