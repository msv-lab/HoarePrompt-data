The variable `min_length` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the computed difference `i - position_map[target_pos]`. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and the variables `final_x` and `final_y` still retain their values as the code does not modify them. The value of `target_pos` is computed as `current_x + dx`, `current_y + dy`, which is still intact since the code does not alter `target_pos` or `position_map`. The `position_map` is maintained in its initial state.

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 0, `target_pos` is `current_x + dx`, `current_y + dy`, `min_length` is the minimum value between its current value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`.**
