The operation `final_y -= 1` decrements the value of `final_y` by 1. The initial state indicates that `final_y` is currently 0. Therefore, the new value of `final_y` will be -1 after the execution of the code.

The other variables are not directly impacted by this operation, so they retain their original values. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is the initial x-coordinate, `y` is the initial y-coordinate, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, the first character of `operations` is not 'U', and the current operation `op` is 'D'.**
