The variable `current_y` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific values of `final_x`, `final_y`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. The only change is an increase in `current_y` by 1.

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 1, `position_map` now contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 1`, `current_y` is increased by 1**.
