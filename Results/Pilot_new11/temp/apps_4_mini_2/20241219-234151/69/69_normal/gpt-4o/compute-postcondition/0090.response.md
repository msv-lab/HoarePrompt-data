The code snippet is assigning a new value to `min_length`. The variable `min_length` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the expression `i - position_map[target_pos]`. The values of `final_x`, `final_y`, `n`, and `target_pos` remain unchanged after execution.

Since `target_pos` is already defined as `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, we can utilize this in our expression. 

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, and `min_length` is updated to min(`min_length`, `i - position_map[target_pos]`)**.
