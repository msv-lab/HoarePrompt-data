The `name` and `type_` variables are assigned values based on the input received from the user, which are split into two parts. The variable `files` that contains a tuple of (name, int(type_)) will need to be updated based on the new values of `name` and `type_`. 

Since `type_` is given as a string in input and it is converted to an integer for the tuple, this will affect the way `files` is constructed but the specifics of that construction are not explicitly shown here.

The initial constraints mention that `files` is a list containing one tuple and `name` is an input string, while `type_` will take the form of an integer after conversion. After running the code, `name` will have the value of the first input string and `type_` will be the integer value of the second input string.

The values of `n` and `files` are not directly affected by this input split, other than the update to the tuple within the `files` list. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `files` is a list containing one tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)), where `name` is the first input string and `type_` is the integer value of the second input string.**
