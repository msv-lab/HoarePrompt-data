The loop executes `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. In each iteration, a name and type are read as input, and a tuple consisting of the name and the integer value of the type is appended to the `files` list.

After all iterations of the loop are finished, the `files` list will contain `n` tuples, each corresponding to the input received during the loop execution.

If the loop executes the full `n` times, the output state will reflect that `files` contains all `n` tuples.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples of (name, int(type_)) where each tuple corresponds to the input received, and the elements represent names and their corresponding type as integers.**
