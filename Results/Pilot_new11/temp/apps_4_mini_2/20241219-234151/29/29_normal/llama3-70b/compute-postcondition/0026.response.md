The code appends a string formatted as `f'move {file} {i}'` to the list `script`. The value of `file` is the second element in `regular`, and the value of `i` is calculated as `len(examples) + 2`. Other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state is updated with the new contents of `script`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a non-empty list containing at least 2 elements, `file` is the second element in `regular`, `i` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `script` now contains the new entry `move {file} {i}` appended to it.**
