Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing all first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0 and must have at least 1 element, `script` is a list containing strings of length `len(regular)`, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`, `len(script)` is equal to `len(regular)` and `line` is printed.**
