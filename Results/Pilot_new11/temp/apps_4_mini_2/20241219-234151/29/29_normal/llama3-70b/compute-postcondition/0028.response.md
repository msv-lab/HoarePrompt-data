The code appends a new string to the `script` list, which includes the `file` variable and the computed value of `i`. Since `i` is calculated as `len(examples) + 3`, it reflects the length of the `examples` list plus three. The other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a non-empty list containing at least 3 elements, `file` is the next element in the list, `i` is equal to `len(examples) + 3`, and `script` contains the new entry `move {file} {len(examples) + 3}` appended to it.**
