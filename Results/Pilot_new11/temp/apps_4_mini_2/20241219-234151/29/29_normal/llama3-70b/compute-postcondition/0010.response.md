The `files` list initially contains one tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)). The code appends a new tuple to this list, which consists of the values of `name` and the integer conversion of `type_`. 

After this operation, `files` will contain the original tuple as well as the newly appended tuple. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation, but it is important to note that after appending, the length of the `files` list will increase. 

The updated state of `files` will reflect that it now contains two tuples: the initial tuple and the new one created from `name` and the integer value of `type_`. 

Output State: **`n` is 2; `files` is a list containing two tuples: the original tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)) and the new tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)).**
