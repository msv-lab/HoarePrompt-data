You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), followed by n lines where each line contains a distinct filename (a string of digits and small English letters, 1 to 6 characters long) and an associated type (0 for regular tests, 1 for example tests).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name, type_ = input().split()
        
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples of (name, int(type_)) where each tuple corresponds to the input received, and the elements represent names and their corresponding type as integers.
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing the strings `['move {file} 1', ..., 'move {file} k']` for each file in `examples`, `file` is the last element in `examples`, `k` is the number of elements in `examples`.
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing all first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing strings `['move {file} 1', ..., 'move {file} k', 'move {file} {len(examples) + 1}', 'move {file} {len(examples) + 2}', ..., 'move {file} {len(examples) + len(regular)}']` for each file in `regular`, `file` is the last element in `regular`, and `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing all first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing strings of length equal to `len(regular)`, if `regular` is empty then `line` has no value printed, if `regular` has elements, `line` has printed all strings in `script`, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `i` is equal to `len(examples) + len(regular)`, and `len(script)` is equal to `len(regular)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer n, followed by n lines of input where each line contains a filename and its associated type (0 for regular tests and 1 for example tests). It organizes this input into a list of tuples, sorts them primarily by their type in descending order, and creates a "script" that describes the movement of files according to their type. The function then prints the number of commands in the script and the corresponding commands for moving both example and regular files. If there are no regular files present, it will only print the commands related to example files and report the number of commands as the length of the script. The function does not handle cases where the input format may be incorrect or where no files are provided.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
