#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer n, followed by n lines of input where each line contains a filename and its associated type (0 for regular tests and 1 for example tests). It organizes this input into a list of tuples, sorts them primarily by their type in descending order, and creates a "script" that describes the movement of files according to their type. The function then prints the number of commands in the script and the corresponding commands for moving both example and regular files. If there are no regular files present, it will only print the commands related to example files and report the number of commands as the length of the script. The function does not handle cases where the input format may be incorrect or where no files are provided.
