The `files` list is updated by appending a tuple that contains the `name` string and the integer value of `type_`. Since `name` is an input string and `type_` is converted to an integer, the resulting `files` list will contain that new entry.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the updated value for `files`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing one tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the first input string, `type_` is the second input string**.
