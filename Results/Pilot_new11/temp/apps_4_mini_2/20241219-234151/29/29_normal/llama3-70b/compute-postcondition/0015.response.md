The code initializes `script` as an empty list. The initial state containing `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular` remains unchanged since the code does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State summarizes the initial conditions while noting that `script` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is an empty list.**
