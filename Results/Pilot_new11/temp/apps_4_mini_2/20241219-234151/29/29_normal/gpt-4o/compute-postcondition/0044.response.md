The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` was previously one greater than an unknown integer and still less than or equal to `2 * n`, the new value of `temp_counter` will be the previous value plus one. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is now the previous value plus 1 (still less than or equal to `2 * n`), and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a non-empty list; `i` is 1; `temp_counter` is now incremented by 1 and still less than or equal to `2 * n`**.
