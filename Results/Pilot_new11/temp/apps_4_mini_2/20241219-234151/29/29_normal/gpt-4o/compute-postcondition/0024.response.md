To determine what adjustments need to be made for the `while` loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions involved in the loop.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```
Here, the loop continues while two conditions are true:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must exist in `files_set`.

Now, examining the provided state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000`, which means `2 * n` is at least 2 and at most 200000.
- `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, so if `files_set` is derived from `files`, it also contains at least `n` strings. 
- `examples` is non-empty, and specifically, the first value of `examples` does not equal the string representation of `1`.
- `i` is 0.

The loop will execute if `temp_counter` is within bounds (i.e., it does not exceed `2 * n`) and also if its string representation exists in `files_set`.

For this loop to execute at least once, we need to verify the initial condition of `temp_counter`:
- If `temp_counter` is not defined in the state, it is assumed to be initialized to `0` (for a typical scenario unless otherwise stated).

Assuming `temp_counter = 0`, the conditions would be:
1. `temp_counter (0) <= 2 * n` which is always true since `n` is at least 1.
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`, which translates to checking if `"0"` is in `files_set`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we must make sure that the string `"0"` is present in `files_set` derived from `files`.

Thus, to ensure that the loop executes, let's adjust the current state to specify this condition:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, and files_set must include the string "0"**.
