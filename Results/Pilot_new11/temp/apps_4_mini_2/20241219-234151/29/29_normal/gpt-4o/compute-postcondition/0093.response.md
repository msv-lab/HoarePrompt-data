The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The given condition states that `temp_counter` must now be less than `2 * n`, and it should also be a value that appears in `files_set` after decrement. However, the previous value of `temp_counter` and `n` is unknown as they were not specified. Therefore, the output state must reflect that the previous conditions remain valid along with the increment.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is now incremented by 1, and `temp_counter` must still be less than `2 * n` and must appear in `files_set` after decrement.**
