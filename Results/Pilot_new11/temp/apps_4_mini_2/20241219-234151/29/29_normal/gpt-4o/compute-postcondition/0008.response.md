Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that contains at least 1 string; `file` is the first string in the list; `name` is the first part of `file`; if `type_` is '1', then `examples` includes the value of `name` as its new element; otherwise, `regulars` includes the value of `name` where `type_` is not equal to '1'.***
