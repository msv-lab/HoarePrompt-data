The code initializes `regulars` as an empty list. The previous values of `n`, `files`, and `examples` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of all variables and the new state of `regulars`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list.**
