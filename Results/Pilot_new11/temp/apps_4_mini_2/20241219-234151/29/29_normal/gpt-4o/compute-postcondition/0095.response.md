In the provided code, the function `append` is called on the list `moves`. The string being appended is constructed using an f-string, incorporating the values from the list `regulars` at index `i` and the value of `temp_counter`. 

According to the initial state, `temp_counter` is unchanged and is greater than `2 * n`, while the other variables preserve their original values. 

After executing the code:
- The `moves` list will now have an additional entry formatted as `f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.

The rest of the variable states remain unchanged, as no calculations or assignments affect them.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` and not in `files_set`; `moves` now includes an additional entry formatted as 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'; `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `i`, `target` remain unchanged.**
