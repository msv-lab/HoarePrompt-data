Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, and `i` is 0. If `examples[i]` does not equal the string representation of `i + 1`, then `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1; `files_set` must include the string representation of all integers from 0 to `temp_counter - 1`; the loop has terminated due to `temp_counter` being greater than 2 * n or the string representation of `temp_counter` not being in `files_set`; `moves` now includes `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`; `examples[i]` is updated to be the string representation of `temp_counter`; and `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.***
