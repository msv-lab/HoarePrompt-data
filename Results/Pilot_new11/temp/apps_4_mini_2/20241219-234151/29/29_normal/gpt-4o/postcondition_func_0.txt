The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of strings `files`, where each string is in the format "name_i type_i". It processes this list to categorize filenames into two groups: examples (type '1') and regular tests (type '0'). The function then ensures the `examples` list aligns to their respective indices, moving names to new identifiers when necessary. This process is repeated for the `regulars`, assigning them either new identifiers if they conflict with existing ones or their designated target positions. The function returns a list `moves` that contains formatted strings detailing the movements of both the example and regular test files. If neither group needs to be moved, the function still generates meaningful identifiers for all entries, while handling possible overlaps with pre-existing filenames effectively. If there are no valid identifiers available for moving either examples or regulars, the function may fail to accommodate those entries, leading to potential edge cases where returns do not capture all states.
