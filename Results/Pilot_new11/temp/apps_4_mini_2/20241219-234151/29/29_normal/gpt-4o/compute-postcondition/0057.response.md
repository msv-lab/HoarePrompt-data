The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` was previously incremented by 1 and is still less than or equal to `2n`, the new value of `temp_counter` becomes at most `temp_counter + 1`. However, since we don't have the specific previous value of `temp_counter`, we will indicate that it has been incremented without specifying its final numerical value. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and is now ≤ 2n; `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.**
