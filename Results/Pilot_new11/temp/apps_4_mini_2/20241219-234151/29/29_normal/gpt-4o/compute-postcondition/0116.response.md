The value of `i` is 2, so `regulars[i]` refers to `regulars[2]`, which has just been updated to `str(temp_counter)`. The `target` is equal to `n + 3`. The `moves` list is appended with a new formatted string that includes the current value of `regulars[2]` (which is now `str(temp_counter)`) and the value of `target`.

The output state updates the values accordingly, while keeping the rest of the initial conditions intact. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range of [1, 100000], `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string, `regulars` is now updated to have `regulars[2]` equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `i` is 2, `target` is equal to `n + 3`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1` and not in `files_set`, and `moves` includes the string 'move {str(temp_counter)} {n + 3}'.**
