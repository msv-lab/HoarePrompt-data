The code initializes `moves` as an empty list. The other variables `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` remain unaffected by this operation as no changes are made to them. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that contains at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing the names extracted from `files` where the corresponding type_ is '1'; `regulars` is a list containing the names extracted from `files` where the corresponding type_ is not equal to '1'; `moves` is an empty list.**
