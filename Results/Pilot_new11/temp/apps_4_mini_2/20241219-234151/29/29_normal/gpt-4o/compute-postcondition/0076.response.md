According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `temp_counter`, `n`, and if `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. The loop will continue as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` exists in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1, so its current value is one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration. To execute one more time, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Therefore, we need to adjust `temp_counter` back to its previous value or keep it equal to `temp_counter - 1`, which would be within the valid range.

Additionally, we must ensure that the `str(temp_counter)` remains part of `files_set` for the loop to execute again. Assuming `temp_counter` was incremented to a value that retains this membership, we do not need to adjust this state unless we have specific constraints about the set membership.

The state of `regulars` and `i` does not need to be adjusted directly since they do not affect the loop execution condition in this iteration context.

Thus, we will keep the current state with `temp_counter` being one less than its last value but ensure that `temp_counter` remains within the acceptable limits. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved; `moves` is a list containing formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, capturing the moves made with the corresponding `temp_counter` values; `temp_counter` is decremented by 1; `regulars` has at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `target` is len(examples) + 1; the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`.**
