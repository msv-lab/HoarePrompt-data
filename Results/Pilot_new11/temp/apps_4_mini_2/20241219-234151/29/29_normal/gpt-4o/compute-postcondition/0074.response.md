To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to check the conditions based on the variables involved:

1. The loop will execute as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. Currently, `temp_counter` has the value of `2 * n + 1` at the end of the last iteration, which indicates that it exceeds `2 * n`. Therefore, `temp_counter` needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n` for the loop to execute again.

3. If `temp_counter` as it stands (currently `2 * n + 1`) modifies state appropriately, it could be adjusted to `2 * n` because to allow the loop to execute at least one more time, `temp_counter` must equal `2 * n`. 

4. The expression `str(temp_counter)` must resolve to be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` needs to adjust, evaluate if after this adjustment, whether `str(temp_counter)` (which will be `"2 * n"`) needs to be ensured to exist in `files_set`.

5. Also, we observe that other variables like `regulars`, `i`, and `target` do not affect the execution of this particular `while` loop in terms of whether it will run.

Given these points, we need to adjust only the `temp_counter`. We ensure other variables do not require changes and merely suggest that `str(temp_counter)` needs to exist in `files_set` if necessary.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved; `moves` is a list containing formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, capturing the moves made with the corresponding `temp_counter` values; `temp_counter` must be adjusted to 2 * n; `regulars` has at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `target` is len(examples) + 1; the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`**
