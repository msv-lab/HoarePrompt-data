The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, it will now be greater than or equal to 0 and up to `2 * n + 1`. The conditions related to `n`, `files`, `examples`, `i`, and the relation regarding `str(temp_counter)` being in `files_set` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, and `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, must be less than or equal to 2 * n + 1, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
