The `temp_counter` variable is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` must have been adjusted to be less than or equal to `2n`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` is incremented, it will now be `temp_counter + 1`, which will still be less than or equal to `2n` if the original value of `temp_counter` was already maxed at `2n - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and is still ≤ 2n and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.**
