n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), and files is a list of n tuples where each tuple consists of a string (filename) and an integer (1 for example test, 0 for regular test). The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct and can contain digits and lowercase English letters, with lengths ranging from 1 to 6 characters.
