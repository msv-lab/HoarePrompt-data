The variable `examples` is initialized as an empty list. The previous states of `n` and `files` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state after executing the given code reflects the initialization of `examples`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings, `examples` is an empty list**
