The statement `regulars.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. The variable `name` is derived from the `file`, which is the second string in the `files` list, specifically the first part of that string. The state of the other variables, including `n`, `files`, and `file`, remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings; `file` is the second string in the list; `name` is the first part of `file`; `regulars` now contains `name`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings; `file` is the second string in the list; `name` is the first part of `file`; `regulars` now contains `name`.**
