The value of `examples[i]` is assigned the string representation of `temp_counter`, which is `str(temp_counter)`. The previous value of `temp_counter` is `2n + 1`. Therefore, `examples[i]` will now hold the string representation of `2n + 1`. The other states of the variables are unaffected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is 2n + 1, `n` is as per the original defined limits (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least n strings with `str(temp_counter - 1)` present in `files_set` prior to exit, `moves` has a new element added: the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`, `examples[i]` is the string representation of `2n + 1`.**
