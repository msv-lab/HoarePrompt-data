According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the size of the `examples` list. The loop will execute if the `examples` list has at least one element. Since `examples` contains names extracted from `files` where the corresponding `type_` is '1', there must be at least one string that fits this criterion in the `files` list. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` will correspond to the last index of the `examples` list. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can run, `examples` must contain at least one name, and `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0**
