You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code and consider edge cases that might not be handled correctly.

### Code Overview
The program reads a list of files that can be either examples (type 1) or regular tests (type 0). The desired output is to rename these files such that:
- All example files have names "1", "2", ..., "e" (where e is the total number of examples).
- All regular files follow with names "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n".

The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the required "move" commands to achieve this ordering.

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling Gaps in Filenames**: The program assumes it can always rename files directly to a new filename without checking if that filename already exists in the set of files at the time of renaming. This is particularly important, as it can lead to overwriting files unintentionally.
  
2. **Incrementing Temporary Filenames**: The logic for determining `temp_counter` attempts to find a new unique filename that does not already exist. This counter will continue to increment until a unique filename is found, but it could potentially keep going indefinitely if not managed properly. Moreover, it might not effectively handle cases when there are significant gaps in filenames or when filenames provided may conflict.

3. **Incorrect Moves**: In the current solution, after deciding on the target filenames, the program makes moves without thoroughly checking if the final state is as expected. For instance, if there are already files named "1", "2", ..., the program could lead to unintended conflicts when placing the renamed files.

### Edge Case
Consider the following input:
```
3
test1 0
test2 0
1 1
```
Expected behavior is to rename "1" to "1", "test1" to "2", and "test2" to "3", resulting in:
```
move 1 1
move test1 2
move test2 3
```
However, if "1" is processed first, the name will already exist when it tries to rename "test1" later. The logic should account for current and future file names, ensuring no conflicts arise.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified above, especially regarding filename conflicts that can occur due to the nesting of the `while` loop and lack of thorough checks, the program does not cover all cases appropriately.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]
files_set = set((file.split()[0] for file in files))
moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and files is a list of strings where each string is in the format "name_i type_i", with name_i being a distinct filename consisting of digits and lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 6, and type_i being "1" for example tests or "0" for regular tests.
