In the provided code, `examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `examples`. The variable `name` is defined as the first part of the string `file`, which itself is the third string in the list `files`. This operation does not alter the initial state of other variables, including `n`, `files`, `file`, and `type_`. However, the `examples` list will now include this new entry.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings; `file` is the third string in the list; `name` is the first part of `file`; `examples` now includes `name`.**
