According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop will execute again if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is found in `files_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `temp_counter` is now one greater, so it is currently equal to the previous `temp_counter + 1`.
- `temp_counter` is still less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. The condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` must still hold. Since `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, we do not need to adjust this state.
2. We need to ensure that `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in the `files_set` for the loop to execute again. Since `temp_counter` is currently one greater than the last value, we have to ensure that `str(temp_counter + 1)` exists in `files_set`.

We do not have to change anything else regarding `n` or `files`, since all other conditions have been satisfied. Thus, we state that `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is now one greater, still less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**.
