The code `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')` results in appending a formatted string to the `moves` list. Specifically, the value `examples[i]` is taken from the current `examples` list, and `i + 1` is calculated based on the current value of `i`, which is `1`. 

Thus, it follows that `i + 1` equals `2`. The appended string will be in the format `move {examples[1]} {2}`. 

Since `moves` is updated by this operation, its state will change, while the states of other variables such as `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `temp_counter` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a non-empty list; `i` is 1; `temp_counter` is set to `2n + 2`; `files` still contains at least `n` strings including `str(2n + 1)` in `files_set`; `moves` now contains an additional entry `move {examples[1]} 2`.**
