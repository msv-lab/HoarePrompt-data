The value of `examples[i]` is updated to be the string representation of `temp_counter`. Given that `temp_counter` is incremented to a value greater than `2n` where `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, we can conclude that `examples[2]` will be set to this string value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is incremented to a value greater than `2n` where `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `examples[2]` is set to `str(temp_counter)`.**
