The statement `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. The string includes the value of `examples[i]` where `i` is currently 2, and also the current value of `temp_counter`. The values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `temp_counter` remain unchanged in their definition outside of the operations performed here. The `moves` list will have a new string appended to it based on the indexed value from `examples` at position 2 and the current `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is incremented to a value greater than `2n` where `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `moves` contains the formatted string 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}' appended to it.**
