The program aims to find the length of the longest substring of a given string `s` that is not a palindrome. Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description and the output hints.

### Program Code:
```python
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

### Output Hints:
The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

### Analysis:
1. **Base Case (Length <= 1)**: If the length of `s` is less than or equal to 1, the function correctly prints `0`, as there can be no non-palindrome substrings.

2. **Checking for Palindrome**: 
   - The first check `if not func_1(s)` correctly identifies that if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, the maximum non-palindrome substring is the string itself, returning its length.
   
3. **Trimming and Checking**:
   - The second check `elif not func_1(s[1:])` trims the first character and checks if this substring is not a palindrome. If this substring is non-palindromic, it prints `len(s) - 1`, which is correct since we effectively dropped one character, but the remaining string is still non-palindromic.
   - The third check `elif not func_1(s[:-1])` does the same but removes the last character.

4. **Final Check**: 
   - If both trimmed checks yield palindromes, then the program correctly concludes that all possible substrings are palindromic and prints `0`.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- When `s` has all identical characters (e.g., "aaaa"), the checks will yield correct results since all substrings are palindromic, leading to the expected output of `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all specified cases adequately and correctly determines the longest non-palindrome substring according to the problem description. Thus, it fulfills its function for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
