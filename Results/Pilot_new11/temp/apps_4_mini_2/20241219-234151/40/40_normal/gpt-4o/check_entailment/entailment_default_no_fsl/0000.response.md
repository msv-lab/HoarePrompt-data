Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as laid out in the problem description. Specifically, it fails for certain inputs where the longest substring that is not a palindrome is not simply the original string minus one character.

For example, consider the input "aaaaa". The longest non-palindromic substring length should be 0, as all substrings are palindromes, which is what the program would correctly output. However, consider non-trivial cases like "abccba". The original string is not a palindrome, so the output should be its length, which is 6. However, the logic fails to correctly identify cases beyond the first and the last character checks.

Moreover, there can be cases such as "racecar", which is a palindrome. The program would just look at the output without properly identifying the longest non-palindromic substring, leading to incorrect outputs.

Thus, when analyzing the sample cases and potential edge cases, the code does not guarantee correct behavior across all input scenarios as per the problem, which justifies the verdict of incorrectness.
