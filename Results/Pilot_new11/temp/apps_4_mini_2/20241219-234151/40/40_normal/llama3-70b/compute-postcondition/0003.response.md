According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `i` values from 0 up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, which means that `s` must not be an empty string. In the initial state, `max_len` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop but may be modified during the iterations.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following adjustments need to be made: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` starts at 0.

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `max_len` is 0**
