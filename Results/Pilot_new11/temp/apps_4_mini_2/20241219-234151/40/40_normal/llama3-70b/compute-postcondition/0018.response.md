According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length `n`. The loop executes for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `i` is `0`, we know that the loop has not yet executed for the first time. 

Since `i` will be incremented by `1` for each iteration, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the values at the start of that next iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.

For the loop to execute again, there should be at least one character in the string `s`, which is implied since `n` is derived from the length of `s`. 

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found in `s`, `j` will range from 1 to `n`**.
