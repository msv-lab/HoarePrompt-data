The code `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` updates the value of `max_len` by assigning it the greater value between its current state and the length of `substr`. The initial values indicate that `s` is a user-input string of lowercase English letters, and `substr` is `s[1:3]`, which means it consists of characters from index 1 to 2 (the second and third characters of the string). The length of `substr` will, therefore, be either 2 or less depending on the length of `s`.

Since we don't have the specific value of `max_len` or its initial value, it can be assumed it remains unchanged in cases where `len(substr)` is less than or equal to `max_len`, and it will be updated in cases where it is larger.

After executing the code, we have:

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `substr` is `s[1:3]`, and `max_len` is updated to the greater value of its previous state or `len(substr)`.**
