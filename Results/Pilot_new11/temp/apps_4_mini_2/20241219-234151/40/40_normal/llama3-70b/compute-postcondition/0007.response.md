The `max_len` variable is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. Given that `substr` is a string of lowercase English letters, its length is a positive integer (greater than 0) since it consists of the first character of the user-input string `s`. The previous value of `max_len` is not provided explicitly but it is assumed to be defined prior to this line of code; however, it doesn't affect the new assignment unless necessary to compare.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated `max_len`â€”which will be the greater of its initial value or 1 (length of `substr`).

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is the first character of `s`, and `max_len` is max(max_len, 1).**
