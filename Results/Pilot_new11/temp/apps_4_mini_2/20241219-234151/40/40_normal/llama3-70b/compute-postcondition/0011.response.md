The variable `max_len` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is defined as the first two characters of `s`, its length is always 2. The output state does not change the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, or `j`. The current value of `max_len` is dependent on its previous value and the length of `substr`. 

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is the first two characters of `s`, `max_len` is max(max_len, 2)**
