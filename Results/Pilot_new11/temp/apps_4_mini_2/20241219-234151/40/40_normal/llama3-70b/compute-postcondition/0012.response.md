Postcondition: ***`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `substr` is the first two characters of `s`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of `max_len` and 2. There is no else part in the code.***
