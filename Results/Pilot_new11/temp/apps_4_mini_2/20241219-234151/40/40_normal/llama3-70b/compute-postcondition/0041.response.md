`max_len` is assigned the value of the maximum between its current value and the length of `substr`. The length of `substr` is determined by the characters in the string `s` from index 2 to index 4. The existing states of `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `substr` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to 4, `max_len` is updated to be max(max_len, len(substr))**
