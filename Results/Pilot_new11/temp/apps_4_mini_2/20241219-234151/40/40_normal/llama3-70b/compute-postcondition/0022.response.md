The code assigns `max_len` to the maximum value between its current value and the length of `substr`. Given that `substr` is `s[1:2]` and is not equal to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`), the length of `substr` will be 1. The value of `max_len` is updated based on the comparison with its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1, `j` is 2, `substr` is `s[1:2]` and `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`).**
