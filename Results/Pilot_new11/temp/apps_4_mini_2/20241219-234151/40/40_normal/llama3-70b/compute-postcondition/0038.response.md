Postcondition: ***`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to 3. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 2. If `substr` is a palindrome (i.e., equal to its reverse), then `max_len` remains unchanged.***
