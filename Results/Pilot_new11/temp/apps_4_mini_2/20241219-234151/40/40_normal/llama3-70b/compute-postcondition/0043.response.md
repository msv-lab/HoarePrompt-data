According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`, which means the next value for `j` would be `j = 3`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop can execute for values of `j` up to `n`, so the maximum value for `j` could be 4 or more.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 5.

Hence, the states need to be adjusted accordingly. Since `s` is unchanged and `substr` may need to reflect the next substring of `s`, which would be from index 2 to 5 if `j` is incremented correctly, while still fulfilling the condition that `n` must be at least 5 for accessing that index range.

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to 5.**
