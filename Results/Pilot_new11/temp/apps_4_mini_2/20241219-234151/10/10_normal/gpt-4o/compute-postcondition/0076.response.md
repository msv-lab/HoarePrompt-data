The value of `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `y1`, and `y2` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1, `top_count[i]` is unchanged, `x1_j` and `y1_j` are the first two values of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` and `y2_j` are the next two values of `sofas[j]`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, and `y2` is less than `y1_j`.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1, `top_count[i]` is unchanged, `x1_j` and `y1_j` are the first two values of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` and `y2_j` are the next two values of `sofas[j]`, `y1` is less than `y1_j`, and `y2` is less than `y1_j`.**
