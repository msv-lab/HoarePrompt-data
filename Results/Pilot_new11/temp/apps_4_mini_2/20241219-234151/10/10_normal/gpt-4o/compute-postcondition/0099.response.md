The variable `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `d`, `i`, `right_count`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
