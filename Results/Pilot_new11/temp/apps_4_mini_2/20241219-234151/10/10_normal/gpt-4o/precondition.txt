d is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) representing the number of sofas; n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) denoting the dimensions of the storehouse; each of the d sofas is represented by a pair of coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) such that 1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are adjacent and distinct; cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, and cnt_b are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1) representing the conditions for the sofa's position relative to Grandpa Maks's sofa.
