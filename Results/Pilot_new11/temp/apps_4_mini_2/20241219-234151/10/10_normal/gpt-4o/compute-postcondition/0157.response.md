According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `d`. If `i` is less than `d`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration, and `d` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 1**
