Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is also less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, these conditions are not met and no changes occur to `bottom_count[i]`.***
