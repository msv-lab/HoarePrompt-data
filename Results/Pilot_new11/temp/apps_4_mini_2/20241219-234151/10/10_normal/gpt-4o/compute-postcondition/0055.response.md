The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `d` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1**
