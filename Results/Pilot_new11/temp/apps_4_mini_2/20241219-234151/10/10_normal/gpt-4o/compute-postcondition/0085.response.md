In the code snippet provided, the variable `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain unchanged.

Since `i` is stated to be unchanged, we don't know its value, but we do know that `right_count` is an indexed variable and is being modified at the index specified by `i`.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the respective values from `sofas[1]`, and `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
