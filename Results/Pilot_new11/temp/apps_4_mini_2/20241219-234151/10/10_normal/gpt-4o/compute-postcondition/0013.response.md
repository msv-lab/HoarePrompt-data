After executing the given code snippet, the variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` will be updated with the values obtained from user input. The other variables retain their initial conditions. However, specific values for `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are not provided, so we denote them as integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5); `n` is defined by input; `m` is defined by input; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are integers derived from the user input; `sofas` is a list with `d` elements, each element being a tuple of four integers.**
