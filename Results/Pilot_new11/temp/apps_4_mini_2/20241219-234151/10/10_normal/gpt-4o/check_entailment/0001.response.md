To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze its functionality against the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Observations from the Code:
1. **Input Reading:** The program correctly reads the number of sofas (`d`), the dimensions of the storehouse (`n`, `m`), the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of other sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa.

2. **Counting Logic:**
   - The program maintains four lists to count how many sofas are to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa.
   - It correctly identifies if one sofa is positioned to the left, right, above, or below another based on the coordinates provided.

3. **Final Comparison:**
   - After counting, the program compares the counts for each sofa with the given conditions (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`). 
   - If a match is found, it saves the index of that sofa and exits the loop.

4. **Output:** If a suitable sofa is found, it prints the index (1-based). Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum Input Values:** 
   - If `d = 1` (the lowest possible number of sofas), the counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`) would all be `0`. The only sofa should satisfy this condition, and the output should be `1`.

2. **Sofa Position Overlap:** 
   - The code assumes that there will only be one sofa meeting the conditions, but it does not check for cases where the counts are valid. For example, if there are positions where multiple sofas meet the exact same count of other sofas (though the problem guarantees no more than one valid solution), it doesn’t handle this logically. 

3. **All Sofas in a Row/Column:** 
   - If all sofas are positioned in a straight line either horizontally or vertically, the counting logic should correctly compute the counts of other sofas, but we need to ensure it does so without error by validating against edge scenarios.

4. **Non-Existent Cases:** 
   - If conditions cannot be met by any sofa configuration, the program should output `-1`, which it does, but we want to check if the counting logic would mistakenly suggest a sofa when none is available.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- The example provided in the problem description seems to cover multi-dimensional locations correctly; however, without running tests on edge distributions, we cannot ascertain if logic flaws exist.

### Conclusion:
While all provided example scenarios seem to suggest that the program functions as indicated, there is a gaping assumption about the uniqueness of suitable solutions that could lead to erroneous results under unforeseen distributions. However, the current implementation follows the expected logic from what we analyzed.

Thus, given that I don’t have a contradiction from examples present, the answer stands:

Correctness: **True**
