Postcondition: ***If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, and both `y1` and `y2` are less than `y1_j`, while `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state is unchanged.***
