`x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the `sofas[j]` tuple. The variable `j` is currently equal to 1. The variable `i` is equal to (i + 1) and there is a condition that if `i` is equal to `j`, the loop continues to the next iteration but does not change the values of `j` or `sofas`. The value of `d` remains greater than or equal to 2 and is unaffected as well. 

Since the specific values of `sofas` have not been defined, we cannot determine specific values for `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned based on the second element (index 1) of `sofas`.

Output State: **`i` is (i + 1), `j` is 1, `d` is greater than or equal to 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`**
