According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is unchanged. Since `j` has executed values from 0 to `d-1`, this means that the value of `i` must be less than `d` for the loop to execute again. 

If we consider that the loop body modifies `i` when executed, for the loop to run one more time, `i` will increment by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted at the start of the next iteration to be `i + 1`, and `d` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `d` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
