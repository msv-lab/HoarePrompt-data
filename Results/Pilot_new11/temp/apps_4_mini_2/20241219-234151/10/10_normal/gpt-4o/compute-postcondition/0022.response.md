The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, it affects the program's control flow but does not modify the values of any variables directly. The values of the variables `d`, `i`, `j`, and the relationship that `i` is equal to `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `i` is equal to `j`.**
