In this scenario, we see that `left_count[i]` is being incremented by 1, but the information regarding the previous or current value of `left_count[i]` is not provided. The states of `current_j`, `d`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, and `right_count[i]` are not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same, with the specific change to `left_count[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is `current_j + 1`; `d` is greater than `current_j + 1`; `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[current_j + 1]`; `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
