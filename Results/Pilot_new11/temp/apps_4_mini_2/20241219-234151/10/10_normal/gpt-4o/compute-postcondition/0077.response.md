Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are each increased by 1, while `top_count[i]` remains unchanged. If the conditions are not met, the state of the counts remains unchanged.***
