The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining block of code inside a loop and proceed to the next iteration of that loop. No variables are modified or updated as a result of this statement. Therefore, the only effect is that the program moves on to the next iteration without executing any further lines of code in the current iteration.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the respective values from `sofas[2]` if it exists, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
