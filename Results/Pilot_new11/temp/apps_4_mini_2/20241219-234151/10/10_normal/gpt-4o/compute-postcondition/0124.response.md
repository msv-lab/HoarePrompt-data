Postcondition: ***If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, and `d` is greater than or equal to 2. Moreover, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains 0, both `y1` and `y2` are less than `y1_j`, `left_count[i]` and `bottom_count[i]` are increased by 1, and `top_count[i]` is also increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
