The operation `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` of the list or array `right_count` by 1. The initial state indicates no information about the previous value of `right_count[i]`, but we know that `d` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are set from `sofas[2]`. Therefore, the state of variables not affected will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
