The tuple `sofas[j]` is unpacked into the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The value of `j` is 1, which means this operation retrieves the second element (index 1) of the `sofas` list or tuple. However, the exact values of these retrieved coordinates depend on the current content of the `sofas` data structure. The other variables (`d` and `i`) remain unchanged, so we keep their previous state. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the variables x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j are assigned the values from sofas[1].**
