Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `top_count[i]` is increased by 1, and if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are each unchanged. Current values of `y1` and `y2` are greater than `y2_j`.**
