The line of code `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]` assigns the first two values of `sofas[j]` to `x1_j` and `y1_j`, and the next two values to `x2_j` and `y2_j`. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged as they are still referenced from `sofas[i]`.

Since `i` is unchanged and this assignment is dependent on the value of `j`, which is currently 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will get their values from the `sofas` list at index `j`.

None of the other variables change as a result of this line of code.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` are unchanged, `x1_j` and `y1_j` are the first two values of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` and `y2_j` are the next two values of `sofas[j]`, if `i` is equal to `j`, the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
