The variable `i` is set to 1 based on the condition that `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`. The program then proceeds to execute the statement `left_count[i] += 1`, which increments the value of `left_count[1]` by 1. The other variables such as `j`, `right_count[0]`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` stay unchanged. The rest of the variables' states are maintained as per the initial condition.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer; if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `i` is 1, `j` remains 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1, and `left_count[1]` is incremented by 1. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, and the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j`.**
