#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is an integer representing the index of a sofa, sofas is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of the sofas. Additionally, the last input line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) representing the number of sofas around the specified sofa. The input also ensures that 1 ≤ d ≤ 100000 and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` represent the counts of sofas that are, respectively, to the left, right, above, and below the specified sofa when compared to their coordinates. If there are no sofas in `sofas` that are equal to the specified sofa index, all counts are incremented based on the comparative coordinates of the sofas with respect to the specified sofa index. If no sofas exist or only the designated sofa is considered, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged from their initial state of 0.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns left, right, top, and bottom, which remain unchanged from their initial state of 0, as there are no sofas in the list 'sofas' that correspond to the specified sofa index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `sofa` and a list of tuples `sofas`, where each tuple consists of four integers representing the coordinates of sofas. It calculates and returns four integers: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`. These integers represent the count of sofas in relation to the specified sofa's coordinates. Specifically, `left` counts the number of sofas to the left, `right` the number of sofas to the right, `top` the number of sofas above, and `bottom` the number of sofas below the designated sofa. If the given sofa is equal to any one of the sofas in the list, those sofas are ignored in the count. If there are no sofas in the list or if only the specified sofa is considered, all four counters remain at their initial value of 0. The code does not handle cases where the input lists may be empty or improperly formatted, which could result in errors or incorrect behavior. Overall, the function provides a count of the position of others in relation to the selected sofa.
