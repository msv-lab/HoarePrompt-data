Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` only considers the first cell (the top-left corner) of each sofa for comparisons when determining their relative positions (left, right, top, bottom). However, since each sofa occupies two neighboring cells, the comparisons should account for both cells of each sofa.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
2 2
1 1 2 1
1 2 2 2
0 1 0 0
```

In this case, there are two sofas: the first covers cells (1, 1) and (2, 1), and the second covers cells (1, 2) and (2, 2). The expected counts for the second sofa based on the given conditions should be `cnt_l=0`, `cnt_r=1`, `cnt_t=0`, `cnt_b=0`. However, using the current logic, the function would incorrectly calculate the counts based solely on one cell of each sofa and may lead to incorrect outputs.

Thus, the program can return incorrect results due to the condition checks being based on insufficient criteria and not accounting for all cells of the sofas accurately. This demonstrates that the implementation is incomplete and fails to correctly satisfy the problem requirements for all potential cases.
