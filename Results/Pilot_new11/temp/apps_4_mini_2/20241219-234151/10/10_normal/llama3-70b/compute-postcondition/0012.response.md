Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa; `sofas` is a list of tuples that contains at least one tuple; `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`, and the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, then `left` and `right` have both been incremented by 1; otherwise, `left` and `right` remain unchanged. The current value of `s` has a first element less than the first element of `sofa` and the second element equal to the second element of `sofa`.***
