To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description:

1. **Understanding the Logic**: The program reads the number of sofas and their coordinates in a matrix. It then checks for the count of sofas that are to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa provided. The logic relies on identifying how many sofas are situated in relation to Grandpa Maks's sofa based on the specified conditions.

2. **Key Points from the Problem**:
   - Each sofa occupies two neighboring cells.
   - The conditions for a sofa being to the left, right, top, or bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa strictly relate to their position within the matrix.

3. **Identifying Potential Issues**: 
   - The method `func_1` is designed to count the sofas based on their positions compared to the current sofa being evaluated. However, the comparisons in this function only consider the first cell of the sofa's coordinates (i.e., `sofa[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]`), which could lead to incorrect counts, especially when checking for vertical relations (top/bottom) and horizontal relations (left/right). 
   - It should also consider the coordinates of both cells of a sofa to determine the correct count, as sofas can be positioned in various orientations.

**Counterexample**: 
Consider the following input:
```
2
3 2
1 1 1 2
2 2 2 1
0 0 0 0
```
- The first sofa occupies (1,1) and (1,2).
- The second sofa occupies (2,2) and (2,1).
- According to the counts provided (0 to the left, 0 to the right, 0 above, and 0 below):
  - The first sofa has 0 sofas to its left (correct), 1 to its right (the 2nd sofa is to the right), 1 above (the 2nd sofa is below), which does not satisfy `cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b` as (0, 0, 0, 0).

The issue demonstrated is that the logic fails to accurately account for certain placements by only examining one of the two cells that make up each sofa's coordinates.

**Conclusion**:
Given the dependency on improper comparison logic in `func_1`, the program may not yield the expected results for a variety of input configurations.

Correctness: **False**.
