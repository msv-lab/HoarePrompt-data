You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to examine how the program processes the input and computes the maximum sales.

1. **Understanding the Input and Problem Logic**: 
    - We have `n` days with `k[i]` products available and `l[i]` clients arriving each day.
    - If it's a sell-out day, the products are doubled, meaning `2 * k[i]` products can potentially be sold if there are enough clients.
    - The goal is to pick `f` days for the sell-out to maximize the total products sold over `n` days.

2. **Analyzing the Code**: 
    - The program reads the inputs and processes them into a list of days containing tuples of `(k, l)`.
    - It calculates the regular sales (minimum of products available and clients) and the potential sales increase from selling out.
    - It then sorts the potential sales increase in descending order and adds the top `f` increases to the total regular sales.

3. **Checking for Edge Cases**:
   - For `f = 0`: The program should simply return the total sales without any sell-outs.
   - For scenarios where `k[i] = 0` or `l[i] = 0`, the output should still make sense and not cause any logical issues.
   - A critical edge case occurs when `k[i] < l[i]` and we choose to sell-out a day where the demand exceeds the initial supply; we must ensure we don't double count.

4. **Potential Case Where the Program May Fail**:
   - Consider a scenario where all days have zero clients except one day that has some products and clients. For example:
     ```
     Input:
     3 1
     5 0
     0 0
     3 2
     ```
     - Here, without sell-outs, the maximum products sold would be `2` (only the last day has clients).
     - If we choose to sell-out the third day, it should allow selling `3` products (limited by clients), resulting in `3` as maximum sales when chosen for sell-out.
     - If `f = 3`, then it has to adhere to choose from all days and must evaluate that if no clients come, there should not be any consideration of those days.

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - After reviewing initialization of lists and the algorithm focusing on maximizing sales, considering the edge cases, and ensuring it meets all possible conditions.
   - Given the potential case where the program might give an inaccurate total in unusual input scenarios, the program does not account as effectively for days where there are no viable sales to process correctly.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be concluded as:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes three parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of days, a non-negative integer `f` representing the number of days to choose for sell-out, and a list `days` containing `n` tuples of two non-negative integers—`k_i` (the number of products available) and `l_i` (the number of clients on each day). The function calculates the total sales by first determining the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each day to compute regular sales. It then calculates the potential sales increase for each day as the difference between twice the available products and regular sales, only considering valid cases. After summarizing the regular sales, the function sorts the potential sales increases and adds the top `f` values to the total sales. The final output is the total sales amount, which includes the base sales plus the additional sales from the chosen potential increases. Therefore, the function ensures that it maintains accurate handling of possible edge cases, such as when `f` is zero (resulting in no additional sales) or when `n` is at its bounds. Overall, it computes and returns the potentially increased sales amount based on the input conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
