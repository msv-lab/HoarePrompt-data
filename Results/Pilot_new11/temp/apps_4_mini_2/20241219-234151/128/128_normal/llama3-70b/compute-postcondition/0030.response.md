The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition as provided, which implies it may rely on global variables or predefined inputs elsewhere in the implementation. However, based on the constraints provided, there are implied parameters based on the problem context.

`n` is an integer that falls within the range 1 to 100,000, representing an arbitrary size of input. `f` is also an integer that ranges from 0 to `n`, indicating a quantity relative to `n`. The values `k_i` and `l_i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) are integers, constrained between 0 and \(10^9\), indicating a specific range of acceptable input values for each `k_i` and `l_i`.

Based on the output descriptions (although not provided directly in this case), it is necessary to consider the anticipated functionality. Since an output isn't defined in your input, assuming some standard behavior or outcome might be expected.

Functionality: **The function does not directly accept parameters but utilizes `n` (an integer within 1 to 100,000), `f` (an integer within 0 to n), and the lists of integers `k_i` and `l_i` (integers between 0 and \(10^9\)) within its logic, which likely performs processing based on these values and returns a result related to them.**
