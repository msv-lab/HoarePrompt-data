The code appends a tuple `(k, l)` to the list `days`. The variable `_` is not affected, and we know that `n` remains within its bounds (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). We will consider `days` as a list that is now extended with the values of `k` and `l` as a new tuple.

Overall, the output state will indicate that `days` has been updated with the new tuple while keeping the existing values of `n`, `_`, `k`, and `l` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000; `_` is 0; `k` is an input integer; `l` is an input integer; `days` is updated to include the tuple `(k, l)`**
