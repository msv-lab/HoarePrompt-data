In this scenario, the code `sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` will impact the variable `sold` by adding the minimum of the two elements from the tuple located at index `i` in the list `days`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is the length of the list of tuples `days`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will refer to the first index that is out of bounds for the list, which typically occurs if `i` is equal to `n` (since list indexing starts at 0).

Therefore, when attempting to access `days[i]`, it leads to an IndexError in typical Python execution. However, we will describe what the intended action is assuming a proper index is used.

If we assume that `days[i]` is a valid access and exists for `i` that satisfies the condition, the operation affects `sold` by adding the minimum of `days[i][0]` and `days[i][1]` to its current value.

Since the question does not provide the initial value of `sold`, we will denote it as `sold_initial` initially.

Output State: **`days` is a list of `n` tuples sorted by the difference `l - k`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, and `sold` is updated to `sold_initial + min(days[n][0], days[n][1])` if `n` is a valid index otherwise an error occurs.**
