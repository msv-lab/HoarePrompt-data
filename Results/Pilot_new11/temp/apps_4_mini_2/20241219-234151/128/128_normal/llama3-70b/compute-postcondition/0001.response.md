The code initializes an empty list `days`. The values of `n` and `f` remain unchanged after this operation, as the code only affects the `days` variable, which is now an empty list. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `f` is an integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n, `days` is an empty list**
