The `days` list is updated to include the tuple `(k, l)` through the `append` method. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `_` also remains unchanged. The values of `k` and `l` will affect `days` since they are input integers which were provided in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is in the `days` variable where the tuple `(k, l)` is added.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `_` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` includes the tuple `(k, l)`**
