Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, and the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0. Given that 'YES' has been printed, and with `k` as 3, `l` as 2, and `r` as 2, if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then the output will be (3, 2, 2).***
