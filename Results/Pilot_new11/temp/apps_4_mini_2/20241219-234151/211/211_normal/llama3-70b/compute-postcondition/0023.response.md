The `print(k, l, r)` statement executes and outputs the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. Based on the initial state, we know that `k` is `2`, `l` is `1`, and `r` is `2`. The other variables remain unchanged after this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` represents the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2; the output is (2, 1, 2).**
