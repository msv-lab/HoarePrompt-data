Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the logic for splitting the array into subarrays while ensuring their sums are non-zero is incorrect. 

### Issues:
1. The logic checks only if the prefix sum up to each index is non-zero and that it does not equal the final prefix sum, but it does not adequately ensure that every produced subarray has a non-zero sum.
2. The program also incorrectly prints the last subarray using `print(k, l, n)`, which prints the current value of `k` instead of updating it correctly for the last subarray span.

### Counterexample:
For instance, consider the input:
```
5
2 -2 0 0 0
```
- The overall sum is `0`. So, `print('NO')` is executed.
- However, the expectation could be that we can still form non-zero sums from other entries, such as `2` and `-2` can combine, and the `0`s alone can be excluded. 

Since the overall sum is `0`, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` when potentially valid splits could maintain required properties if the input allowed. 

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements for all cases as specified, and correctness is thus **False**.
