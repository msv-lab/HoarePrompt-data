The `prefix_sum` variable is assigned a list of zeros, with the list having a length of `n + 1`. The initial value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, `prefix_sum` will have `n + 1` elements, all initialized to zero. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `a` is a list of `n` integers based on input; `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
