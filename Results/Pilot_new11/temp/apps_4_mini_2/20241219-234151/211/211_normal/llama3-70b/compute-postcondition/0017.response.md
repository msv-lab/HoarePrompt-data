Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `i` is `n - 1`, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1. The value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.***
