You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description and various scenarios.

1. The program first calculates the total sum of the elements in the array `A`. If this sum is not zero, the program correctly identifies that the entire array can be a valid subarray, provides the output `YES`, and specifies that there is only one new array consisting of all elements (`1, n`).

2. If the total sum is zero, the program proceeds to check each element of the array `A`. If it finds any element that is not zero, it splits the array into two parts: one from the start of the array to the element before the non-zero element and the second part from the next element to the end of the array. It then prints the indices of these two new subarrays.

3. If all elements in the array are zero, the program prints `NO` as it is impossible to create subarrays with non-zero sums.

### Potential Cases to Check:
- For an input where the total sum of the array is zero, but there's no possible way to split it into valid non-zero sum subarrays, the program might fail.
  
**Test Case:**
- Input: `4`
- Array: `0 0 0 0`
  
The output should be `NO`, and the program performs correctly here.

However, consider another scenario:

**Test Case:**
- Input: `5`
- Array: `2 -2 0 0 0`

The total sum is zero. The program will find the first non-zero element (2 at index 1), then output:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 5
```
This output is invalid because the second subarray `[2, 0, 0, 0]` has a sum of zero.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly handle arrays where the total sum is zero yet contains a valid combination of elements that cannot be split into non-zero sums, the behavior in this case indicates the program's logic is flawed.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `n`, which specifies the length of a list `A` containing `n` integers, with each integer in the range of -1000 to 1000. It calculates the sum of the integers in list `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints "YES", followed by "1", and the values "1" and `n`, indicating that a non-zero sum was found. If the sum is zero, it checks for non-zero elements in `A`. If it finds one, it prints "YES", followed by "2", and the indices of the first non-zero element (1-based index) and a range from the next index to `n`. If all elements are zero, the function does not provide any output. The overall state of the program after execution is that it will either confirm the presence of non-zero sums or indicate that all elements are zero without a specific output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
