The code snippet executes a `print` statement, which outputs the result of `i + 2` and `n`. The variable `i` has an initial value of `2`, and `n` is stated to be greater than `2`. Therefore:

- The value of `i + 2` equals `4` (since `i` is `2`).
- `n` remains unchanged and continues to be greater than `2`.

The output state should reflect the values of the variables after the execution of the code without altering any other variables.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 2, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, and '4', `n` are printed.**
