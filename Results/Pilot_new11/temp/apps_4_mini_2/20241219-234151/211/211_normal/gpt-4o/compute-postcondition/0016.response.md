According to the loop, it will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop is ready to execute once more. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` must be greater than 1, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1**
