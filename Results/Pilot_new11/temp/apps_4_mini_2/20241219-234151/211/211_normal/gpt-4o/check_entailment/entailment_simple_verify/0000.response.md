Based on the analysis provided in the original assessment and the accompanying annotated version of the program, I maintain that the program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description.

Let's recap the reasoning:

1. **Total Sum Not Zero**: The program correctly outputs "YES" when the total sum of the array is not zero, indicating that the entire array can be considered as one part.

2. **Total Sum Zero**: The problem arises when the total sum is zero. The program checks for non-zero elements to create two subarrays. However, the program only terminates the loop upon finding the first non-zero element, leading to a split that might not satisfy the constraint of forming valid parts with non-zero sums when the elements can be grouped differently.

3. **Counterexample**: The counterexample highlighted:
   ```
   Input:
   3
   0 1 -1
   ```
   demonstrates a scenario where the sum is zero, but valid non-zero partitions exist. The program fails to recognize this and outputs "NO", which is incorrect per the problem requirements.

In terms of the annotations:
- The states after the loop clarify that the program expects either all elements to be zero or at least one non-zero element to make a valid split. However, it does not account for the situation where the total sum is zero yet can still be split into valid non-zero subarrays.

Given all this, the original assessment is accurate: the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description due to edge cases, and thus, it is incorrect.

Final: **False**
