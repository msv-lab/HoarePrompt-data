To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description and various scenarios.

1. The program first calculates the total sum of the elements in the array `A`. If this sum is not zero, the program correctly identifies that the entire array can be a valid subarray, provides the output `YES`, and specifies that there is only one new array consisting of all elements (`1, n`).

2. If the total sum is zero, the program proceeds to check each element of the array `A`. If it finds any element that is not zero, it splits the array into two parts: one from the start of the array to the element before the non-zero element and the second part from the next element to the end of the array. It then prints the indices of these two new subarrays.

3. If all elements in the array are zero, the program prints `NO` as it is impossible to create subarrays with non-zero sums.

### Potential Cases to Check:
- For an input where the total sum of the array is zero, but there's no possible way to split it into valid non-zero sum subarrays, the program might fail.
  
**Test Case:**
- Input: `4`
- Array: `0 0 0 0`
  
The output should be `NO`, and the program performs correctly here.

However, consider another scenario:

**Test Case:**
- Input: `5`
- Array: `2 -2 0 0 0`

The total sum is zero. The program will find the first non-zero element (2 at index 1), then output:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 5
```
This output is invalid because the second subarray `[2, 0, 0, 0]` has a sum of zero.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly handle arrays where the total sum is zero yet contains a valid combination of elements that cannot be split into non-zero sums, the behavior in this case indicates the program's logic is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
