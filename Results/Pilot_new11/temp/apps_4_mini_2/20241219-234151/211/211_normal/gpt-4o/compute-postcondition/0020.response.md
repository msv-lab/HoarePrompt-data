The print statement outputs the results of the expression `i + 2` and the value of `n`. The value of `i` is `1`, and `n` is greater than `1`, but its specific value is not provided. For the calculation, we can determine that `i + 2` evaluates to `3`. Therefore, the output from the print statement is `3` and the value of `n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so they remain the same. 

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` must be greater than 1, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed. The output from the print statement is '3 n' where n is the value of n.**
