`total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the digits in the string `ticket`. Since `ticket` is a string of digits, each character in the string will be converted to its numeric value, and the overall sum will be calculated. The previous state of variables is not changed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits with a length `n`, where `2 <= n <= 100` and each digit is between `0` and `9`; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with a length `n`, where `2 <= n <= 100` and each digit is between `0` and `9`; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.**
