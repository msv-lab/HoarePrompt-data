According to the code, the loop will execute for each digit in the `ticket` string. Given that `ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, we need to determine the current state variables that will affect the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the `ticket` is still a string with a length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number, and `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`. 

During each iteration, the variable `digit` will take on the next character of the `ticket` string sequentially. 

If the loop has already iterated through the current length of the `ticket`, we need to know the index of the next digit that `digit` will take.

Assuming that the loop is currently at the last index (i.e., length of `ticket` - 1), for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that the next index exists. Thus, if the loop is currently at the index corresponding to the last digit, the loop will not execute again because there are no additional digits.

To facilitate the loop's execution for one more time, we assume that it needs to look at the next digit:

1. The ticket must not be fully consumed; thus it needs to contain at least one additional digit which hasn't been processed yet.
2. The position of `digit` for the next iteration (if it exists) will increment to the next character in the string.

Given that there are no other index or variable states specified, we can summarize the needed changes to indicate the next state:

State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2, curr_sum` remains unchanged, `segments` stays the same, `digit` is the next digit in the string**.
