Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is set to 0, `segment_count` is 1, `segment_length` remains 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, and `i` remains 0.***
