The variable `current_sum` is reassigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `int(ticket[2])`, but this is overwritten. The states of the other variables (`n`, `ticket`, `segment_count`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased to 2, `i` is 2.**
