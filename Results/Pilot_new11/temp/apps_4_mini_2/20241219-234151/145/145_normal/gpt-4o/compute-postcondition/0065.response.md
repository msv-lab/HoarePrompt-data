The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to `int(ticket[2])`, but now it is updated to `0`. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `segment_length` remains 2, `target_sum` equals to `segment_sum(0,1)`, and `i` is 2.**
