The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100. The parameter `ticket` is a string consisting of exactly `n` digits, where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9. The function produces several possible outputs based on the conditions checked within its logic:

- If the first condition is satisfied, the function returns 'YES' (Case 1).
- If the criteria for having multiple segments whose sum equals the target sum is met, the function also returns 'YES', indicating that the `current_sum` has been reset and a final iteration index of n - 1 has been reached (Case 2).
- Similarly, if the condition for having more than one segment with a sum matching the `target_sum` is satisfied, the function returns 'YES' (Case 3).
- If none of the conditions are met, the function returns 'NO' (Case 4).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `ticket`, and based on the specified conditions, it returns 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether certain summation conditions are satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (an integer between 2 and 100) and a parameter `ticket` (a string of exactly `n` digits). It returns 'YES' if certain summation conditions are satisfied, and 'NO' if they are not.**
