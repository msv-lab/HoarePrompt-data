The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `current_sum` was the integer value of `ticket[1]`, which is a digit from the `ticket` string. Now, `current_sum` is changed to `0`, but the values of the other variables remain the same. The values of `n`, `ticket`, `segment_count`, and `i` are not affected, and their previous states are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is increased to 1, `i` is 1.**
