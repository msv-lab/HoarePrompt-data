The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The prior state of `current_sum` was not equal to 0, thus it is changed to 0 now. The other variables (`n`, `ticket`, `segment_count`, `segment_length`, `target_sum`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1, `segment_length` remains 2, and `target_sum` is equal to `segment_sum(0, 1)`.**
