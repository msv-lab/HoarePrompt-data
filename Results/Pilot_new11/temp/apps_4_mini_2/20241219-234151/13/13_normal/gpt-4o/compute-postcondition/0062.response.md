The code assigns the first and second elements of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments` to `prev_start` and `prev_end`, respectively. The variable `i` is initialized to 3, so `i - 1` equals 2, meaning `prev_start` and `prev_end` will be assigned the values from the tuple at index 2 in the `segments` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 3; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is the first element of the third tuple in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the third tuple in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 3 in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 3 in `segments`; `max_length` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 3; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is now the first element of the third tuple in `segments`; `prev_end` is now the second element of the third tuple in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 3 in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 3 in `segments`**.
