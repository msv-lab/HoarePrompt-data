The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Previously, `i` was 3, so after the execution of the code, `i` will now be 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `trophies[3]` must be 'G', `trophies[2]` must be 'G', `trophies[1]` is 'G', `segments` contains the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 4, `start` is 1**
