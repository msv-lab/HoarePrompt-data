Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n` (indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed), and `segments` contains tuples for each contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string. Since there are no 'G' characters, `segments` is empty.***
