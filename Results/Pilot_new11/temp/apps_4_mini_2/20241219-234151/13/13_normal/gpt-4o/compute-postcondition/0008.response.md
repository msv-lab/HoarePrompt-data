The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so we can't specify the exact new value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies[i]` must be 'G' for `i` equal to 1, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `trophies[i]` must be 'G' for `i` equal to 1, and `i` is increased by 1**
