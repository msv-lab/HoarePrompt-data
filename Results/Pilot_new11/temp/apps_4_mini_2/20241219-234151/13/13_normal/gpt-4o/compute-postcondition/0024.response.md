Output State: **`i` is `n` (the total length of the string), `trophies[1]` to `trophies[n-1]` are all 'G' if initially `trophies[1]` is 'G', `segments` contains the tuple (1, `n - 1`), if `trophies[1]` is not 'G', then `i` remains 1, `segments` is empty, and `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000.**
