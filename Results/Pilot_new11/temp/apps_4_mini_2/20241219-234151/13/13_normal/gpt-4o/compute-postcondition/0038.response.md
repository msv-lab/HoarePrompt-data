In the provided code snippet, a tuple containing the values of `start` and `i - 1` is appended to the list `segments`. 

We have the following initial conditions:
- `i` is equal to the original value of `n`
- `start` is 2
- `n` must be greater than the original value of `n - 1`, so `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- All `trophies` within the index range 2 to `n-1` are 'G'.

Since `i` is equal to `n`, when we calculate `i - 1`, it will be `n - 1`. Therefore, the values that will be appended to `segments` are the tuple `(2, n - 1)`.

The output state will include the updated `segments` list and the values of other variables remain unchanged because the code does not modify them directly.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the original value of `n`, `start` is 2, `n` must be greater than the original value of `n - 1`, and all `trophies` from the index 2 to `n-1` must be 'G'; `segments` has a new tuple (2, n - 1) appended.**
