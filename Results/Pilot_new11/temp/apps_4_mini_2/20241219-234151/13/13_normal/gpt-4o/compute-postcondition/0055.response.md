Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 1; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is the first element of the first tuple from `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the first tuple from `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the second tuple from `segments`, and `curr_end` is the second element of the second tuple from `segments`. If the difference between `curr_start` and `prev_end` equals 2, `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - prev_start + 1`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
