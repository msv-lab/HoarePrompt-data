You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the given problem description, we need to analyze how the program attempts to solve the problem of maximizing the length of the longest contiguous segment of golden trophies after performing at most one swap.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of trophies and the arrangement of trophies correctly.

2. **Identifying Segments of Golden Trophies**:
   - The code correctly identifies segments of contiguous 'G' (golden trophies) and stores their start and end indices in the `segments` list.

3. **Calculating Maximum Length**:
   - The program calculates the maximum length of contiguous 'G's without swaps, which is correct for the case where there is only one segment.
   - The implementation tries to maximize the length by considering the possibility of joining two segments with one swap, provided that there is exactly one 'S' (silver trophy) between them.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The current implementation considers merging segments only if the distance between them is `2` (i.e., one 'S' in between). 
   - If there are multiple silver trophies between two segments, it does not consider the possibility of directly swapping one 'G' from a neighboring segment to fill a gap, which can be problematic.
   - The function doesn't correctly handle the case when there are segments of 'G's that are separated by multiple 'S's (e.g., `GSSGS`). For this input, the maximum beauty should be `3`, but the current logic will not account for that.

### Potential Problematic Case:

- Input case: 
  ```
  5
  GSSGS
  ```
  The output should be `3` because by swapping the 'G' at position `0` with the 'G' at position `4`, we can create a single segment: `GGSSS` which has a length of `3`. However, the program would return `2` because it fails to account for swaps that create longer segments when there are more than one 'S' in between.

### Conclusion:

Since there exists at least one potential input case where the program does not yield the expected correct output, we determine the program's correctness.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))

If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will be empty. The original string can have any combination of 'G' and 'S'.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0

If `segments` is not empty, the original string contains at least one 'G' character.

    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]

If `segments` has no valid pairs where `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` remains as the maximum length calculated through the iterations.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in trophies, and n is the integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000.
