Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S'; `segments` contains the tuple (start, i - 1) if the first character in `trophies` is 'G'; otherwise, `segments` is an empty list; `i` is set to 1, and the character at index `1` in `trophies` is 'S'; and the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S'.***
