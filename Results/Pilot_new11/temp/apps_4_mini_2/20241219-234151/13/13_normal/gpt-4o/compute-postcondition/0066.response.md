Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n-2` in `segments`; `curr_start` and `curr_end` are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n-1` in `segments`; `max_length` is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in `trophies`, which may have been updated based on the conditions of the loop. If `segments` has no valid pairs where `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` remains as the maximum length calculated through the iterations.**
