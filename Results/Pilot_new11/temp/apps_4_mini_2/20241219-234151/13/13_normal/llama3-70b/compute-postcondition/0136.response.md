Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, and if the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value of `beauty`. Otherwise, `beauty` can be either 1 or 2 depending on the character at index `j` of string `s`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
