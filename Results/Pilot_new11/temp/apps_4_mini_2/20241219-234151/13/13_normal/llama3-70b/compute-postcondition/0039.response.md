The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged; hence, their conditions still hold. Given that `right` is equal to `n`, it indicates that the loop cannot execute again, but does not affect any of the other variable states. The Output State reflects the updated value of `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, and the loop cannot execute again since `right` is equal to `n`.**
