The code creates a list comprehension that enumerates over the string `s`, collecting the indices of all occurrences of the character 'G'. The variable `golden` will therefore hold a list of integers corresponding to the indices of 'G' in the string `s`. The previous states of all variables remain valid, except for `golden`, which will now contain the relevant indices.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list of integers representing the indices of 'G' in `s`.**
