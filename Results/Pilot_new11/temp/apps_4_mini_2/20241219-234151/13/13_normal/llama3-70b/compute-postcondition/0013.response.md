The value of `left` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `left` was 0, so after this operation, `left` will become 1. The other variables maintain their values as per the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S', `right` must be greater than 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'.**
