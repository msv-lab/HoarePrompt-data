Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is an integer such that `j` is at least `i + 2` and at most `n - 1`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the calculated `beauty` variable.***
