To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to evaluate the conditions outlined in the `while` statement. The loop will execute as long as both `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `n`: An integer between 2 and 100000, which defines the length of the string `s`.
   - `s`: A string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
   - `curr_beauty`: Initialized to 0, which does not influence the condition to execute the loop.
   - `max_beauty`: The maximum of its previous value and 0, also does not affect the loop execution.
   - `left`: This variable needs to be established to help decide if the loop will run.
   - `right`: Initially set to `n`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - **Condition 1**: `left < right` - This implies `left` must be less than `n`, and since `right` is initialized to `n`, `left` needs to be a value less than `n` to fulfill this condition.
   - **Condition 2**: `s[left] != 'G'` - For the loop to execute successfully, the character at the position `left` in string `s` must not be 'G'.

3. **Analyzing the Current State**:
   - `left` needs to be defined and also connected with `s[left]`.
   - If `s[left]` is currently 'G', then the loop cannot execute.

In light of the above analysis, for the loop to execute at least once:
- `left` must be less than `n`.
- The character `s[left]` must be 'S' to satisfy the condition `s[left] != 'G'`.

Assuming `s[left]` is 'G' right now, `left` could either be incremented or the value of `s` at that index could be adjusted to 'S'.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; `left` must be less than `n` and `s[left]` must be 'S'**
