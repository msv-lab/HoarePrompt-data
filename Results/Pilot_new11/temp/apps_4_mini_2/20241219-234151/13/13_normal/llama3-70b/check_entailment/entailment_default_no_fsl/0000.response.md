Correctness: **False**

The logic in the code for calculating the maximum length of the golden trophies segment after performing one swap is flawed. It only considers adjacent swaps (only when 'G' is followed by an 'S'), meaning it could overlook opportunities to swap non-adjacent trophies that might yield a better result.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
SGGSG
```
The correct answer should be `5` because you can swap the 'S' at the beginning with the last 'G', resulting in:
```
GGSSG
```
However, the current program only checks adjacent swaps, so it would calculate the maximum potential length of golden trophies as `3` (by only focusing on the adjacent 'GS' pairs) and would hence return `3`, which is incorrect. 

Thus, the program fails to capture all possible scenarios for maximizing the beauty of the arrangement, confirming its incorrectness.
