Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000` and `i` is `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `beauty` is equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `s[n-2]` plus the count of consecutive 'G's from the substring starting at index `i + 2`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the current `beauty`. In the absence of any `else` part, no other changes occur.***
