Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, if `s[j]` is equal to 'G', then `beauty` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to 'G', `beauty` remains according to the count of consecutive 'G' characters, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
