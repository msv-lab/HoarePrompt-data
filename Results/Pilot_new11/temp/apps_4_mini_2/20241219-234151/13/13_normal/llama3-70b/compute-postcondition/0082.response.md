The code simply contains a `break` statement. The `break` will exit the most immediate loop or block it is in, but since there is no change to variable values, the variables remain the same. The conditions about `n` and `i` still hold, as they are not affected by the execution of the `break` statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
