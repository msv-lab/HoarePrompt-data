The code updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `beauty`. Since `beauty` is either the count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `n` downwards or defaults to 1 if none were found, the comparison may or may not change `max_beauty_one_swap`.

Thus, if `max_beauty_one_swap` was already set to a value less than `beauty`, it will now be updated to `beauty`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i + 1` (which is `n`) downwards (or 1 if none were found), and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.**
