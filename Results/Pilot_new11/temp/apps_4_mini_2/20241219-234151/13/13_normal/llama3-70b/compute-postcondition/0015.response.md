The variable `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is 1, so the new value of `left` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S', `right` must be greater than 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is now 2, and the character at index `left` in string `s` (which is now index 2) must not be 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S', `right` must be greater than 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 2, and the character at index `left` in string `s` (index 2) must not be 'G'**.
