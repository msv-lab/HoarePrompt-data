The variable `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The other variables' conditions remain unchanged. The initial state mentions that `curr_beauty` was previously 0, so after executing the code, `curr_beauty` is now 1. The conditions of `left`, `right`, `n`, `s`, and `max_beauty` remain valid as stated. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is at the position of 'G' or the position where `left` is no longer less than `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_beauty` is updated to max(`max_beauty`, 0), `curr_beauty` is 1, and the current value of `left` is less than `right`.

Output State: **`left` is at the position of 'G' or the position where `left` is no longer less than `right`, `right` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_beauty` is updated to max(`max_beauty`, 0), `curr_beauty` is 1, and the current value of `left` is less than `right.**
