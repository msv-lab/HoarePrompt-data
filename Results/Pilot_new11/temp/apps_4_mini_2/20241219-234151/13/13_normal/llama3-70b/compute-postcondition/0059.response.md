According to the code, the loop is defined to execute for `j` starting from `i - 1` down to `0`. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the initial value of `j`, which is `i - 1`, is at least `0` for the loop to execute at least once. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `0`. 
- Thus, `i - 1` equals `-1`. 

This means that the starting point for `j` is invalid as it is less than `0`, which will result in the loop not executing at all. 

To ensure that the loop can execute:
- `i` must be at least `1` so that `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`.
- Additionally, the current character at index `i` is 'G', and at index `i + 1` is 'S', which are valid conditions to assume before the loop.

As a result, I need to adjust the state to reflect these requirements.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S', `beauty` is 1**
