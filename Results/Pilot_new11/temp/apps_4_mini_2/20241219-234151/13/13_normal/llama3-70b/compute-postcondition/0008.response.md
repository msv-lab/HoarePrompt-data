The variable `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state shows that `curr_beauty` is 0, so after this operation, its new value will be 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', `right` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is 0, and the character at position `right` in the string `s` is 'G'.**
