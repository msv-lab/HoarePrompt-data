The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `beauty` could be either 2 or 1 depending on the condition related to the character at index `j`. After the code execution, if `beauty` was previously updated to 2, it will now be 3; if it was 1, it will now be 2. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3; `j` is 1; `beauty` is either 3 or 2 depending on its previous value.**
