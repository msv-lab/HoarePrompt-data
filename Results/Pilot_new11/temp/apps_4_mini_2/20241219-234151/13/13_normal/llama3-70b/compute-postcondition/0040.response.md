The `max_beauty` variable is updated by taking the maximum value between its current value and the `curr_beauty` value. The value of `max_beauty` can either remain the same or increase, depending on whether `curr_beauty` is greater than `max_beauty`. The precondition that `right` is equal to `n` confirms that the loop has already concluded, hence no further iterations will occur to affect other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_beauty` is updated to max(`max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`)**.
