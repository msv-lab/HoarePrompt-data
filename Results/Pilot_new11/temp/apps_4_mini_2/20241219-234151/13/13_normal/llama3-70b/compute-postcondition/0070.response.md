The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous state does not provide any specific value for `beauty`, but it can be assumed to be a non-negative integer since it is increased based on a count of occurrences of 'G'. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `beauty` is increased by 1.**
