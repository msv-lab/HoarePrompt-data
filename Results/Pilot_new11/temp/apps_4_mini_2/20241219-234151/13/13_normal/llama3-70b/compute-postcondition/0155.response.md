Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n`, and if `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop or statement is broken, maintaining the conditions that `s[j]` does not lead to breaking the inner loop or condition.***
