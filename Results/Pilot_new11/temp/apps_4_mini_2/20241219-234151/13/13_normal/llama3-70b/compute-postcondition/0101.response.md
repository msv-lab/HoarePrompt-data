The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` remains 1, and `beauty` remains updated to 2 or 1 depending on the character at index `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3; `j` is 1; `beauty` is updated to 2 or remains 1 if character at index `j` is not 'G'; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
