Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 2`, `j` is an integer such that `j` is at least `i + 2` and at most `n - 1`. If the character at index `j` (for all valid j) of `s` are 'G's, then `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's before index `i` plus the total number of consecutive 'G's starting from index `i + 1` up to and including the last consecutive 'G' found before a different character is encountered. If a character that is not 'G' is found before reaching the end of the loop, the `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's before index `i` plus the number of 'G's found up to that point.**
