You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to evaluate whether the program properly handles all potential cases related to maximizing the length of the longest segment of golden trophies (represented by 'G') with at most one swap allowed.

**Key Points from the Problem Description:**
1. We need to identify the longest consecutive sequence of 'G's after potentially swapping two trophies.
2. The input includes the number of trophies and their arrangements as a string of characters ('G' for golden, 'S' for silver).
3. The output should be the maximum length of consecutive 'G's possible after one swap, or the maximum length already present if no beneficial swaps are possible.

**Examining the Code:**
1. The program starts by capturing the indices of golden trophies.
2. It calculates the maximum length of consecutive 'G's without any swaps by iterating over the array.
3. It then examines the potential for lengthening segments of 'G's by checking adjacent pairs of trophies ('G' followed by 'S') and counting how many 'G's are found on either side.

**Edge Cases and Concerns:**
- The program calculates `max_beauty_one_swap` by only considering 'G' adjacent to an 'S'. It does not account for swapping 'G' trophies with each other, which might be beneficial in certain arrangements.
- If the input consists entirely of 'S's, the maximum length should be `0`, which is correctly handled.
- If there are two separated groups of 'G's with only one 'S' in between, the program might fail to recognize that it can swap to lengthen the segment more than just one 'G' on either side.
  
**Finding a Counterexample:**
Let's consider an input case where the potential for a beneficial swap might be overlooked:

Input:
```
5
GSGSG
```
In this situation, without considering the swap logic effectively, the longest segment without a swap is `1`. However, by swapping either of the 'G's with the 'S', we can achieve a maximum segment of `3`, resulting in "GGSGS" or "SGGSG".

**Conclusion:**
Given the above considerations, the program does not adequately derive the correct maximum length when multiple segments exist which can be elongated by a swap. Hence, it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. It calculates the longest sequence of consecutive 'G's in the string, referred to as `max_beauty`. It also computes the maximum potential sequence of consecutive 'G's obtainable by swapping one 'G' with an adjacent 'S', termed `max_beauty_one_swap`. Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. 
The function handles edge cases by ensuring that if there are no 'G's in the string, `max_beauty` will remain 0 (as initialized), and `max_beauty_one_swap` will also remain 0 if there are no valid 'G' followed by 'S' pairs. It effectively considers all possible ways to enhance the beauty score based on given conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
