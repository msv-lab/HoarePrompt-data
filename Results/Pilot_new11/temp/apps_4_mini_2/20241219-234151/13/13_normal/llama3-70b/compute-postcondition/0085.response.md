The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 3`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
