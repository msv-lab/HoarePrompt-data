To analyze the code provided:

1. The current values are: `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3.
2. The code executes the function `max()` which will compare `max_erase` (0) and `j - i - 1` (3 - 0 - 1 = 2).
3. The calculation leads to `max_erase = max(0, 2)` which results in `max_erase` being updated to 2.

The preconditions that remain valid after execution are: `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 since it wasn't altered.

Thus, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`max_erase` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
