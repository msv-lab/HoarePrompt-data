According to the code, the loop will execute again based on the values of `i` and `n`. The current value of `j` is 3, and since the loop starts at `j = i + 1` (which is 2 in this case) and goes up to `n + 1`, we need to determine if `j` can be incremented and if the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute once more, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`, meaning `n` must be at least 4 to allow `j` to increment to 4. After this iteration, `j` will increase by 1.

State: **`max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `n` must be at least 4**
