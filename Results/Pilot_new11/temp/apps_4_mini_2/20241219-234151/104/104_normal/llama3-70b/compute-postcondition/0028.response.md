To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. We know that `i` is 2, which is a defined starting point for the loop.
2. The loop runs with `j` starting from `i + 1`, therefore `j` will start at 3.
3. The loop continues executing as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be such that `j` can take on at least one value.
4. For `j` to take at least one value, `n` must be at least 2 (since with `i = 2`, the minimum value for `j` is 3, and `n` must be at least 2 for `j` to reach 3 and thus execute).
5. The loop depends on the valid values of `j` based on the range defined, along with the condition involving the array `a`.

Given the definition of `max_erase`, it suggests that `j` values are considered over potential valid segments determined by the condition regarding `a`. The other values should be such that the conditions hold true in the context of the execution.

Now, summarizing what adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute:

- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, which is already stated.
- `max_erase` is the maximum value calculated based on valid combinations, but we don't need an immediate adjustment since it already exists as a state before the loop starts.

For the loop to properly initialize with valid `j` values:

State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for valid values of `j`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3 at the start of the loop**
