The expression `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` updates the value of `max_erase` to the maximum of its current value and the result of `j - i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 5, we can compute `j - i - 1` as follows:

1. Calculate `j - i - 1`: 
   - `j - i` = `5 - 2` = `3`
   - `3 - 1` = `2`.

Now we have two potential values for `max_erase`: its current value (which may already be at least 1 or higher since `max_erase` remains unchanged or updated to the maximum of its current value or 1) and the calculated value `2`. Hence:

- If `max_erase` is less than `2`, it will get updated to `2`.
- If `max_erase` is already `2` or greater, it will remain unchanged.

The value of `n` does not change, and its condition remains that it is greater than or equal to `4`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `max_erase` is either unchanged if it is greater than or equal to 2 or updated to 2; `i` is 2; `j` is 5; `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

Output State: **`max_erase` is either unchanged or updated to 2; `i` is 2; `j` is 5; `n` is greater than or equal to 4**.
