To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information.

1. The loop `for i in range(n):` indicates that the loop will execute `n` times. 
2. The condition for `n` is that it is an input integer.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; otherwise, the loop will not execute at all.
4. The variable `i` will take on values starting from 0 up to `n-1` in each iteration of the loop.

Given these points, we can summarize the necessary states:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0**
