Postcondition: ***`max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all `j` where the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` holds true, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, and `j` is 2 in the first iteration. The condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` is true, meaning that for `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, it holds that `a[k] - a[i] == k - i`.**
