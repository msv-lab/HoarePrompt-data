Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased while still allowing the original increasing array to be restored. This can be seen through the output hints and the logic implemented in the function.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
1 5 6 7 8
```
In this case, the maximum consecutive elements that can be erased is `2`, specifically the elements `5 and 6`. However, the current implementation would not recognize it due to the dependency on indices and the specific condition `(a[k] - a[i] == k - i)`, which does not capture situations effectively when there are gaps or when elements aren't indexed consecutively.

The code assumes that every consecutive segment of the list maintains the condition based solely on the first element of that segment. This leads to failure in correctly identifying all potential removals.

Therefore, due to these limitations, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements for every potential case.
