Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` strictly increasing integers from the user input. It calculates the maximum number of integers that can be "erased" (i.e., values that can be removed while satisfying a specific condition related to the sorted nature of the input list). The condition checks for consecutive values based on their indices and updates a variable, `max_erase`, to reflect the maximum count of such removable integers, which is eventually printed. If no values meet the criteria to be considered removable, `max_erase` will remain zero, indicating that no elements can be erased under the specified rule. The function doesn't explicitly handle invalid inputs or edge cases such as when n is not within the provided bounds, nor does it check if inputs are non-integer or improperly formatted.**
