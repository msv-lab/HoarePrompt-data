Output State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all valid values of `j` where the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` holds true for all `j` from `i + 1` to `n`, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. If the loop does not execute, `max_erase` retains its initial value, which is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all valid values of `j` as previously defined.**
