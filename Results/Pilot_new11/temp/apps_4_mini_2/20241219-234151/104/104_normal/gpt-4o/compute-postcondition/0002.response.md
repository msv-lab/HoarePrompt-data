The variable `max_erase` is initialized to 0, and there are no other changes to the variables `n` or `a`. The states of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, while `max_erase` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input within the range 1 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input, where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000; `max_erase` is 0.**
