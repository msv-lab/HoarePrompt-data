The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer with a value between 1 and 100. It also accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers that are sorted in strictly increasing order and where each integer is between 1 and 1000. The function returns a specific output based on these parameters. However, the specific output was not provided in the details.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000).**
