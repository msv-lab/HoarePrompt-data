To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the provided code.

1. **Extracting White Pixels:** The program correctly identifies the coordinates of all white pixels represented by 'w' in the pixel grid.

2. **Determining the Frame Bounds:** The program calculates the minimum and maximum x (row) and y (column) coordinates of the white pixels, which determines the extents of the square frame.

3. **Frame Size Calculation:** The frame size is calculated as the greater of the width and height required to encapsulate the white pixels, plus one. 

4. **Frame Validity Check:** The program checks if the calculated frame size exceeds the screen dimensions. If so, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it can't fit a frame.

5. **Frame Construction:** The program then constructs the frame by replacing the corresponding pixels in the original grid with '+' for the frame's border while keeping 'w' pixels intact.

### Potential Issue:
If there are cases where the white pixels are isolated or positioned such that a compact frame cannot be built without violating the one-pixel requirement, the existing code fails to properly exemplify all edge cases. 

**For example:**
- Consider a case where white pixels are located in such a way that the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates do not form a perfect rectangle (i.e., an L-shape). This could lead to the frame not surrounding all white pixels properly despite all bounds being calculated.

**Test Case Example:**
```plaintext
3 5
....w
..w..
.w...
```
- In this case, the `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` would define a grid larger than a single square, and the program may incorrectly apply the '+' based solely on the bounds without accounting for isolated white pixels.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle cases where the required frame to encapsulate the 'w' pixels cannot be drawn as stated (all 'w' pixels must be on the border of the frame). The computations do not guarantee successful framing in all configurations of white pixels.

Therefore, the correctness assessment is:
Correctness: **False**.
