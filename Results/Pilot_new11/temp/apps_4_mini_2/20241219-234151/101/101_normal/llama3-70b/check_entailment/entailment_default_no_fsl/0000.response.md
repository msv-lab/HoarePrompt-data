Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle certain edge cases as described in the problem statement and output hints. 

1. The code attempts to create a frame around the white pixels without fully considering whether the calculated frame correctly surrounds all of the 'w' pixels. Specifically, if the smallest bounding square that contains all 'w' pixels is exactly equal to the dimensions of the grid itself but does not allow for a valid frame, the program will output '+', which is incorrect.

2. When the frame size exceeds the grid dimensions, the code prints `-1`, which is correct in that case. However, it fails to ensure that a valid frame can be properly formed if the 'w' pixels are on the edges or if they are very closely packed together, leaving no room for a proper frame of width 1.

3. The program does not handle the scenario where white pixels exist at the corners or edges of the grid; it could potentially lead to incorrect placement of the '+' characters or no output when it should be a valid frame. For example, if the white pixels form a perfect U shape near the grid's edge, the program must be able to identify that a frame can be created but may not actually return a frame, leading to an invalid output.

In summary, due to these issues in handling various edge cases, the program is not completely correct according to the problem description's requirements.
