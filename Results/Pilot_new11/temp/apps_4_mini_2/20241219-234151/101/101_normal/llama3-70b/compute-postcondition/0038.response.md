The line of code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` modifies the value at the specific index `i` of the list `pixels` at position `j`. Since `j` is 2, the code updates the second column of the pixels at the row indexed by `i`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged after the operation. `m` only needs to be noted to confirm that it is greater than 2, and no other variables are affected.

Therefore, the output state should clearly reflect that `pixels[i][j]` has been assigned a new value, while preserving the original constraints on `n`, `m`, and `j`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000], `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `pixels[i][j]` is '.'**
