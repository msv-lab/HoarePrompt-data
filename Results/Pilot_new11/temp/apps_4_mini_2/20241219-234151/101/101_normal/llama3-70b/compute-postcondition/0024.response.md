The `continue` statement causes the loop (in which the current iteration is running) to skip the remaining code and move to the next iteration. However, since no conditional checks or changes occurred in this case, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state maintains the values of the variables from the initial state while indicating that the loop iteration is being skipped.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple of (x, y), `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and either `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.', and `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w'; execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
