You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and the following n lines contain exactly m characters each, with characters being either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), where at least one character is 'w'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`.
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` remains a list containing at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged; `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; `pixels` may contain '+' at positions meeting the specified conditions, and unchanged 'w' pixels will remain 'w', while other pixels will be set to '.' if they were not specified to be '+' through the loop conditions. The loop will execute 'n' times, and for each row, all 'm' columns will be processed. If no conditions are met to change any pixels, the pixels array will retain any original setup except for 'w' pixels, which remain unchanged.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To understand the state after all iterations of the loop, let’s analyze the provided information clearly. The loop iterates through `pixels`, which is a 2D list containing `n` rows and `m` columns. Each iteration prints a string that represents the contents of the current `row`. 
        #
        #Given that `n` and `m` are integers within the range [1, 2000], and `white_pixels` is guaranteed to contain at least one tuple, it's ensured that the outer loop iterates based on the number of rows in `pixels`, which is `n` times. The properties regarding `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged during these iterations.
        #
        #After `n` iterations of this loop, the state can be detailed as follows: 
        #1. The loop will print the contents of the 2D list `pixels`, which contains `n` rows with the width of `m` columns.
        #2. Each row's output corresponds to its original state before entering the loop, possibly influenced by modifications made due to conditions regarding `white_pixels`.
        #
        #Considering the conditions, at the end of the loop, `pixels` still has `n` rows and `m` columns, and the unchanged conditions regarding `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` hold true.
        #
        #Thus, summarizing the above conditions:
        #
        #Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` is a list containing at least one tuple (x, y), `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.`
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple (x, y), `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged, and `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than `max(n, m)`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, retaining its original state, and the iteration will print the contents of each row of `pixels` accordingly.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
