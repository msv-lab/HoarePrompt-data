Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000]. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j]` is equal to '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is set to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop without changing `i` or `j`. If `pixels[i][j]` equals '.', the program state remains such that `i` is still 0, `j` is still 0, while preserving the conditions on `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` unchanged, with either `i` being not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` being not equal to `min_y`, `max_y`.***
