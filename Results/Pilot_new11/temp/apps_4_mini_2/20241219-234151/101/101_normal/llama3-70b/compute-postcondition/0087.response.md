Postcondition: ***`n, m, i, j, j_last, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y` are such that `m` is greater than `j_last + 1`. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', then the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are unchanged. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged, `m` is greater than `j_last + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j_last + 1`, and `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` remain unchanged while `pixels[i][j]` is '.'***
