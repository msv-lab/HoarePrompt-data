Output State: **`n` and `m` remain integers in the range [1, 2000]. The variable `i` is still 0, and `j` is equal to `m` after all iterations have executed. The boundaries defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged, and the `pixels` array contains '+' at the positions `(i, j)` where the conditions for setting pixels to '+' were satisfied. If those conditions were never satisfied throughout the loop, the `pixels` array will remain unchanged for positions not equal to 'w'. If the loop did not execute due to `m` being 0 (which should not be possible as per initialization), `pixels` would remain in its initial state with conditions on `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` unchanged.**
