Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. If the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` is true and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `j` is incremented by 1 and `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', then `j` is incremented by 1 without any change to `pixels[i][j]`. In all other cases, `j` is incremented by 1 and `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value '.'***
