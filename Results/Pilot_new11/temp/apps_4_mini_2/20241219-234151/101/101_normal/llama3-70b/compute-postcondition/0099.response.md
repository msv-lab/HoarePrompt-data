The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly through its signature. Instead, it operates on the assumption that it will work with input data defined by the constraints provided. Specifically, it expects an input of `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where `n` and `m` are integers within the defined bounds (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) and the characters are either '.' or 'w'. It processes this input to derive a result. 

The output involves analyzing the arrangement of characters in these lines. Since the output details have not been specified clearly in terms of cases, determining the specific return values based on the input is not possible from the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `n` lines of `m` characters, where each character is either a black pixel ('.') or a white pixel ('w'), and returns a result based on the arrangement of these pixels, ensuring at least one white pixel is present.**
