The `continue` statement does not modify the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration. Since `j` is specified to be incremented by 1 before the `continue`, we understand that the value of `j` has already been updated prior to this point.

Thus, the output state reflects that `j` has been incremented by 1, but other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 (where `j` is less than `m`).**
