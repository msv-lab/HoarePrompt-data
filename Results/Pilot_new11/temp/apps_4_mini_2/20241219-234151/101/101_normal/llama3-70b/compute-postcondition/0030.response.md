The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the pixel at the coordinates specified by indices `i` and `j`. Given that the initial state states that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, we can conclude that the pixel at position `(0, 1)` where `i` is 0 and `j` is 1 will be updated to have the value `'+'`. The other variables and preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000], `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `pixels[0][1]` is '+' while preserving the conditions on `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` unchanged.**
