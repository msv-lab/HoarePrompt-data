Functionality: **The function reads an integer pair (n, m) indicating the dimensions of a grid, followed by n lines of m characters each, representing pixels that can be either black ('.') or white ('w'). It identifies the coordinates of all white pixels ('w') and computes the minimum and maximum coordinates of these pixels. Based on the computed coordinates, it checks whether the size of the bounding frame around the white pixels exceeds the grid dimensions. If it does, the function outputs -1. If not, it modifies the grid, marking the edges of the frame (if they contain black pixels) with a '+' sign while leaving white pixels unchanged and any other black pixels as dots. Finally, it prints the modified grid. 

Edge cases include: 
1. The case where the entire grid is composed only of white pixels (which may require handling to ensure that the edges get modified appropriately).
2. A scenario where white pixels are positioned at the edges of the grid so that nothing is modified.
3. Situations where the size of the frame around white pixels is equal to the grid dimensions, ensuring that the '+' marking conditions operate correctly.
4. The function guarantees that there is at least one white pixel, but does not explicitly handle when all other pixels, apart from the white ones, remain untouched if they are adjacent to the bounding frame. 

The final state includes the original grid modified according to the conditions, or -1 is printed if the bounding frame exceeds the grid's size. The function prints each row of the modified or unmodified grid at the end.**
