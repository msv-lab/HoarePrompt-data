The code `continue` does not change any variable values; it simply causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, as well as the conditions on `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size`. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000], `i` is still 0, `j` is 1; the conditions on `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged.**
