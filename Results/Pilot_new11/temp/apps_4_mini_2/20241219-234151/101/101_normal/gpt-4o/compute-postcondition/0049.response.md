According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` is the current index representing the row being processed, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and `i` is the current row index, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. 

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration as `i_end`, the starting `i` for the next iteration will be `i_end + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i_end + 1` must be less than `n`.

Assuming that `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `i_end`, we can state:
- If `i_end` is < `n - 1`, then `i` for the next iteration is `i_end + 1` and the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, top and bottom remain None, left and right remain out of bounds; `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1**.
