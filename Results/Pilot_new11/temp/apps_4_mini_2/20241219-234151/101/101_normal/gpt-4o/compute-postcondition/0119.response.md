The line `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since we know that `j` is equal to `k + 1`, it does not directly affect the assignment but helps establish the relationship for possible values. The variables `top` and `bottom` will now hold the value of `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is `k + 1`, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`**.
