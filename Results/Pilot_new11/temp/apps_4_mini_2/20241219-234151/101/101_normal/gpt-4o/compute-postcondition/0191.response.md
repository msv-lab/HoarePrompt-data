The value at `result[i][j]` is assigned the value '+'. Since `i` is equal to `bottom + 1` and `top` is less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, it indicates that either `i` is one position beyond the bottom or is equal to the top. This means the `result` grid is being modified at the position defined by `i` and `j`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `result`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, but `result[i][j]` is now '+'.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `result` is a modified list of lists of characters where `result[i][j]` is '+', `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `top` is less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and either `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`.**
