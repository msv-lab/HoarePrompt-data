The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. Since the current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`, `bottom` will now hold the value of `i`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `i` is greater than `bottom`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is not None, `bottom` is equal to the current value of `i`.**
