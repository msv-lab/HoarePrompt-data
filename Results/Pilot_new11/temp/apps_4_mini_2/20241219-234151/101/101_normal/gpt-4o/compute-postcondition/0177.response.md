Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `m` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a list of lists of characters. If `i` is equal to `top`, `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `j` is equal to `right`, the value of `result[i][j]` is updated to '+', while `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, and `i` is within the bounds defined (either `bottom + 1`, equal to `top`, or `bottom`) and `left` is less than or equal to `right`.***
