Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the `screen` if any are present, where `top` is the minimum row index, `bottom` is the maximum row index, `left` is the minimum column index, and `right` is the maximum column index. If no 'w' characters are found, `top` and `bottom` will remain None, and `left` and `right` will remain out of bounds.**
