Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a modified list of lists of characters. `result` will have '+' in its entries where `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right` if those entries were initially '.', while all other entries remain unchanged. The indices are constrained by `i` being equal to `bottom + 1`, `top` being less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, and `left` being less than or equal to `right`.**
