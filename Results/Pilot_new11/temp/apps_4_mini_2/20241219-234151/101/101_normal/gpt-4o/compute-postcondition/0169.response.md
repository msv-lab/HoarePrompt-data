Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a list of lists of characters. If `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or `j` is equal to `left` or `right`, then if `result[i][j]` is equal to '.', it is updated to '+', while the values of `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `left`, and `right` continue to satisfy their respective conditions.***
