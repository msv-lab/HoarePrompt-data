The parameters `left` and `right` are assigned the value of `j`, which is previously equal to `m`. The values for `m` are known to be in the range [1, 2000]. 

The current relations are as follows:
- `left` and `right` are both assigned the same value as `j`, which is equal to `m`.
- `n`, `screen`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.

Therefore, since `j = m`, we can conclude:
- `left` is equal to `m` 
- `right` is also equal to `m`

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is `m`, `top` is equal to `bottom` which is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `m`, `right` is equal to `m`.**
