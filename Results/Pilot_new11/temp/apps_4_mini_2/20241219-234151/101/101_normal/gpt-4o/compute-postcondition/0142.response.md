Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least `n`; `m` must be greater than `k + 2`; `screen` is a list of strings; `j` is equal to `k + 2`. If `top` is None, then `top` is set equal to `bottom`, which is equal to `i`; `left` is set to `k + 2`, and `right` is also set to `k + 2`. Otherwise, if `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`, resulting in `right` being greater than `k + 2`. Otherwise, `right` remains unchanged.***
