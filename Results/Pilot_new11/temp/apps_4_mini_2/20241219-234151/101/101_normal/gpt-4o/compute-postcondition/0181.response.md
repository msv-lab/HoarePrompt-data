Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a list of lists of characters. If `i` equals `top` or `bottom`, or if `j` equals `left` or `right`, then `result[i][j]` is updated from a dot ('.') to a plus ('+'). The values of `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, and `j` is still equal to `left + 1` or values less than `right. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
