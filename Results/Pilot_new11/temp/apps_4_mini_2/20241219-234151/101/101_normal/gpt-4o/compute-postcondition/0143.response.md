Postcondition: ***If `screen[i][j]` is equal to 'w', then either `top` is set to `bottom` (which is equal to `i`), `left` is set to `k + 2`, and `right` is also set to `k + 2` when `top` is None, or `right` is updated to `j` if `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, ensuring `right` remains greater than `k + 2`. If none of these conditions apply, `right` remains unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', no changes occur. Overall, `n` must be at least `n`; `m` must be greater than `k + 2`; `screen` is a list of strings; and `j` is equal to `k + 2`.***
