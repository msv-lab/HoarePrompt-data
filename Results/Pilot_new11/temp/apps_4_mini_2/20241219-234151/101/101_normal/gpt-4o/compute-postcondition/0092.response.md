The code assigns the value of `j` to `right`. Given that `j` is initially equal to `m`, after execution, `right` will be equal to `m`. The values of `n`, `screen`, `left`, `bottom`, `top`, and `i` are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is equal to `m`, `right` is equal to `m`.**
