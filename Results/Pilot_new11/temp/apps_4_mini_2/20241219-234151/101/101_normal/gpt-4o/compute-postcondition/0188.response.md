To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute:

1. The loop runs with variable `j` iterating from `left` to `right`, inclusive. For this loop to execute at least once, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

2. The current values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `result`, `i`, `top`, and `bottom` don’t directly affect the execution of the loop itself, but they may be important for the context within the loop.

3. Since `i` is equal to `bottom + 1` and `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, it implies that the constraints on `i` and `top` can affect the overall logic but aren’t essential for this specific loop to run.

Therefore, the key adjustment needed is regarding `left` and `right`:

- To ensure execution, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

Thus, we can summarize the state adjustments needed:

State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `result` is a modified list of lists of characters, `i` is equal to `bottom + 1`, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom + 1, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`**.
