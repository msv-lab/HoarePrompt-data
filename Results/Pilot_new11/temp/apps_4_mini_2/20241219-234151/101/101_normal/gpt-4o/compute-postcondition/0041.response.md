Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`, while `left` remains 1 and `top` is updated if `i` was less than the current value of `top` or if `top` is None; otherwise, if `i` is not greater than `bottom`, the values of `bottom`, `left`, and `top` remain unchanged.***
