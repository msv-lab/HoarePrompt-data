The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial value of `j` is 1, so `left` and `right` will both be set to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `top` is 0; `bottom` is 0; `left` is 1; `right` is 1**.
