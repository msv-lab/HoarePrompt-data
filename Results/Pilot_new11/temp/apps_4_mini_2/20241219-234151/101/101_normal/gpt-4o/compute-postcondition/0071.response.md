The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. However, we can state that `top` and `bottom` will now hold the same value as `i`. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, maintaining the constraints given in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` and `right` remain out of bounds, `j` is 1**
