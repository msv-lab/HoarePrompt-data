The variables `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Consequently, the values of `top` and `bottom` will both be `0`, corresponding to the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0.**
