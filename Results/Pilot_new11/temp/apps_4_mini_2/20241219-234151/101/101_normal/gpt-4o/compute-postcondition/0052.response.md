Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, top and bottom are None, left and right remain out of bounds, `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the value of `top` is None.***
