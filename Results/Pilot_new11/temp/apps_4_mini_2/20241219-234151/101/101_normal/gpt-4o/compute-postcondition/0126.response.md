Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is equal to `k + 1`, and `left` is equal to `k + 1`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `top` is updated to `i` if `i` is less than `top`, and `bottom` is updated to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`. Otherwise, the values of `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
