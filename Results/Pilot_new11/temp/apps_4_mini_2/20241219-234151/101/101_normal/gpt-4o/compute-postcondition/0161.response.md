Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a list of lists of characters. If `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, `j` equals `left`, or `j` equals `right`, then if `result[i][j]` was originally '.', it is now set to '+', while the conditions for `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `left`, and `right` remain satisfied.***
