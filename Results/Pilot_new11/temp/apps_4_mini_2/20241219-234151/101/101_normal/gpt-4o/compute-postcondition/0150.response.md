The variable `frame_width` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged and are still integers within the specified ranges. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` do not change, so `frame_height` remains equal to `bottom - top + 1`, and we can calculate the value of `frame_width` based on the differences between `right` and `left`. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged; `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is equal to `right - left + 1`.**
