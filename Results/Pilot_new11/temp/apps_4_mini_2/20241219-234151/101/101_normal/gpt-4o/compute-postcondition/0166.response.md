To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration in the loop, we need to analyze the current state and how the loop operates:

1. The loop goes over a range defined by `left` to `right + 1`. This means that for each iteration of `j`, it starts from `left` and ends at `right`.

2. The loop's execution depends on the updates to `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will have been set to `right + 1` when the update occurs.

3. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to start at `left`, and as `j` is currently equal to `right + 1`, that's the end of the range for the loop and `j` must be less than or equal to `right` at the start of the next iteration.

If the loop is to run again, we'll need to increment `j` by 1 from its previous value:
- If `j` is currently `right + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be set to `left` for the loop to be valid again.

Thus, the next state adjustments would reflect that `j` needs to be reset to `left`, and since the loop operates under the condition of `left` and `right`, we keep their values as they currently are.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `result` is a list of lists of characters, j is equal to `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `left`, and `right` continue to satisfy their respective conditions.**
