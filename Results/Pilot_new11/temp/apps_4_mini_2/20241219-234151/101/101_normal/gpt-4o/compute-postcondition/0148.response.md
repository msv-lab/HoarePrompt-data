Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all integers representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the `screen`, and none of these values are None. In this case, `top` is the minimum row index of the 'w' characters, `bottom` is the maximum row index, `left` is the minimum column index, and `right` is the maximum column index.**
