The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `bottom`, `top` remain unchanged, as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `bottom` remains unchanged, `left` is equal to `j`, and `top` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `bottom` remains unchanged, `left` is equal to `j`, and `top` remains unchanged.**
