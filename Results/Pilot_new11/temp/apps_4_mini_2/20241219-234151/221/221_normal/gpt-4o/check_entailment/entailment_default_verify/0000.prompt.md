You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the requirements stated in the problem description. Specifically, it lacks any logic to compute the ordered pairs (a, b) based on the given values of sum (s) and bitwise XOR (x). There are no calculations to validate whether such pairs can exist under the conditions mentioned, or to count how many such pairs exist. 

For example, for the input `s = 9` and `x = 5`, the proper logic should involve checking possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy both `a + b = s` and `a ^ b = x`, but the provided function does not even attempt to do so. Thus, the function cannot yield the correct outputs for any input case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters: `s`, a positive integer within the range [2, 10^12], and `x`, a non-negative integer within the range [0, 10^12]. It performs a series of XOR operations on two implicit variables, `a` and `b`, though `b` is not initialized or defined before being used. This suggests that the function may not operate correctly as written. After execution, while the final values of `a` and `b` depend on their states prior to the function call, at least one value (`b`) is left in an undefined state, suggesting potential errors. Importantly, the function does not return a value, indicating that its primary purpose may be the manipulation of variables or side effects rather than producing an output. Additionally, since there are no explicit actions regarding `s`, its handling remains completely unaddressed in the function, leaving its impact unexplored.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
