The function `func` accepts no parameters directly; however, it implicitly relies on the integer values of `a` and `b`, which represent the number of pieces of two cakes, where `1 ≤ a ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. The parameter `n` is an integer constrained by `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`. 

The specifics of the return value are not provided, but based on the parameters' relationships we can infer that the function operates within the defined constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be summarized as follows:
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer constraints `a` and `b`, and an integer `n` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`. The function will return a result based on these inputs within the defined ranges.**
