Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b)`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `(a - x) + (b - x)` is greater than or equal to `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
