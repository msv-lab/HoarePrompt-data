Functionality: **The function reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. It calculates the largest integer `x` such that `x <= min(n, a, b)` and ensures that `a` and `b` can collectively provide enough pieces to satisfy the condition `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`. If the initial value of `x` does not meet these conditions, the function decrementally adjusts `x` until a valid state is achieved or until `x` becomes less than zero. Finally, the function prints the calculated value of `x`, which may be `0` if no valid configuration exists within the constraints. Thus, the function outputs the maximum number of pieces of cake that can be evenly distributed, taking into account the given constraints and limitations.**
