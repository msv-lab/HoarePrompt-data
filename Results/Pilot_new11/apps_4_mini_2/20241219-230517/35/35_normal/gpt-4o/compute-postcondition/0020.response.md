The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (with the constraint \(1 \leq a \leq 100\)), and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (with the constraint \(1 \leq b \leq 100\)). After executing the function body, the program returns `low - 1`, where `low` is the value where the function `can_distribute(low - 1)` returned false, indicating that no successful distribution could be made. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, and returns `low - 1`, where `low` indicates the value where a distribution of cake pieces was unsuccessful.**
