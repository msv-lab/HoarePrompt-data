The value of `mid` is assigned the result of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The variables `low` and `high` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `mid` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2**
