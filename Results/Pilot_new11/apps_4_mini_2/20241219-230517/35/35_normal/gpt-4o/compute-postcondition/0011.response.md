The line of code assigns the value of `mid` to `high`. The previous values are: `low < high`, and since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, we can conclude that `high` will be set to this value. The statement `high = mid` updates the value of `high` directly to the calculated value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, and `high` is equal to `mid`.**
