You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to examine the input conditions and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Summary:
1. There are `n` plates for the cakes.
2. The first cake has `a` pieces, and the second has `b` pieces.
3. Each plate must have at least `x` pieces, where `x` is the value we want to maximize.
4. No plate can contain pieces of both cakes.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b)` - This function implements a binary search to find the maximum value of `x`.
2. `can_distribute(x)` - This function checks whether it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.

### Problems in the Code:
1. **Scope Issue with `a` and `b` in `can_distribute(x)`**:
   - The variables `a` and `b` are used in the `can_distribute(x)` function, but they are not passed as arguments. They should be passed as arguments to ensure that the correct values of `a` and `b` are being referenced. Otherwise, this function will raise a `NameError` because `a` and `b` are not defined in its scope.

   Thus, the first flaw in the program is that it cannot execute correctly without defining `a` and `b` within the function or passing them as parameters.

### Example to Illustrate the Problem:
Using the input:
```
n = 3
a = 3
b = 6
```
The function should be able to execute `can_distribute(x)` for various values of `x` during the binary search. However, the function call `can_distribute(mid)` will fail due to undefined `a` and `b`. Therefore, the program doesn't handle even this simple condition correctly.

### Conclusion:
Because the program contains a fundamental issue with variable scope that prevents it from being executed successfully, this suggests that the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : Functionality: The function `can_distribute(x)` evaluates whether it is possible to distribute a given number of pieces from two cakes, represented by `a` and `b`, onto `n` plates, ensuring that each plate holds at least `x` pieces. It returns a boolean value: `True` if the total number of pieces that can be allocated on the plates (calculated as the integer division of `a` by `x` plus the integer division of `b` by `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function assumes that `a`, `b`, `n`, and `x` are defined in the surrounding scope and compliant with specified conditions (e.g., `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `n` is at least 2 and does not exceed `a + b`). The function lacks error handling for cases where `x` could be greater than both `a` and `b`, which would lead to scenarios where the plates cannot be filled adequately. Additionally, the function does not verify whether `a` and `b` meet their constraints at the call site, thereby relying entirely on external validation.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
