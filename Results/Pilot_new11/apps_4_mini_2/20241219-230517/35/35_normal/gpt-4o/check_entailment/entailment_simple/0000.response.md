To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the described problem, let's analyze the program behavior based on the requirements stated in the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. All pieces of the cakes must be distributed.
2. Each plate must have at least one piece.
3. No plate should contain pieces from both cakes.
4. The objective is to maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program reads input values for `n` (number of plates), `a` (pieces of the first cake), and `b` (pieces of the second cake).
  
2. **Function `func_1(n, a, b)`**: This function looks to find the maximum value `x` such that each plate can have at least `x` pieces. It uses a binary search approach:
   - `low` starts at 1 (minimum pieces on a plate).
   - `high` is initialized to `min(a, b) + 1` (maximum possible pieces on a plate from either cake).
   - The loop continues until `low` is less than `high`. In each loop iteration, it checks midpoints for possible distributions:
     - `can_distribute(mid)` checks if it's possible to have at least `mid` pieces on `n` plates.
     - Depending on the return value of `can_distribute`, it adjusts `low` and `high`.

3. **Function `can_distribute(x)`**: This function checks if it's possible to distribute enough pieces such that each of the `n` plates receives at least `x` pieces. It does so by checking if the integer divisions `a // x` and `b // x` combined can satisfy `n`.

### Analysis:
- The binary search effectively narrows down the maximum feasible `x` such that both cakes' pieces can be divided according to the constraints.
- The condition within `can_distribute` ensures that every piece must go on a plate (as it checks sums of pieces from both cakes).
- Each plate receives pieces from either cake without mixing since pieces from either cake are only counted separately.
- Updating `low` and `high` allows the program to maximize `x`.

### Conclusion:
The algorithm correctly adheres to the problem requirements, ensuring:
- All pieces are assigned to plates;
- No plate mixes pieces from both cakes;
- It maximizes the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

Given the analysis:
Correctness: **True**
