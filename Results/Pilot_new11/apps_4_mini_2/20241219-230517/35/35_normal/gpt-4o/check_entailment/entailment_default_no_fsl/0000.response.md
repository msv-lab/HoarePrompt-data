Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `can_distribute` does not verify whether it is possible to fill all plates adequately when the number of pieces `x` is greater than both `a` and `b`. 

For example, consider the input `n = 5`, `a = 1`, and `b = 1`. The program assumes that it can find a distribution by using pieces greater than the available pieces, leading to potentially incorrect results. 

According to the requirements, each plate must contain at least one piece of cake, and it is not possible to distribute even one piece to each of the 5 plates because there are only 2 pieces available (1 from each cake). Thus, the output in such scenarios should be zero, which the program might fumble to return correctly due to its binary search logic not adequately accounting for this edge case. 

Therefore, the logic is inadequate as it doesn't cover all conditions laid out in the problem, leading to the conclusion that the implementation is incorrect.
