The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. 
- The new value of `a` is assigned from the old value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` is assigned from the result of `a % b`, where `a` is the old value of `b`, and `b` is the value `old_a % old_b`. 
- Given the condition that `old_a` is not a multiple of `old_b`, `a % b` will yield a non-zero remainder.

Thus, the new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, and since `old_a` is not a multiple of `old_b`, `b` becomes `old_a % old_b`, which is guaranteed to be non-zero. 

Therefore, the output reflects these updates while maintaining the constraints provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is the value of `old_b`, `b` is equal to `old_a % old_b`, and `old_a` is not a multiple of `old_b`.**
