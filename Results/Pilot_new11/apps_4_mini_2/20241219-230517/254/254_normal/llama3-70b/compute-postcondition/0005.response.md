The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is assigned the value of `old_a % old_b` before the swap. Since `old_a` is not a multiple of `old_b`, `b` will have a value that is less than `old_b`. After the execution, `a` will take the previous value of `b`, and `b` will become the value of `old_a % old_b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `old_a % old_b`, `b` is the value of `old_a % old_b`, where `old_a` is not a multiple of `old_b`.**
