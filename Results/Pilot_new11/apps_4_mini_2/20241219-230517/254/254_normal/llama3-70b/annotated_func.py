#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are integers representing the time intervals of the three garlands, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, `c` is an integer representing the time intervals (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500)
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor 'a' of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0 and the constraints 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500 are satisfied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, representing time intervals, where both must be in the range [1, 1500]. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` holds the GCD. The annotations incorrectly imply that the function takes a third parameter `c`, but this is not reflected in the code. There’s also no error handling for cases when the inputs could be out of bounds. Hence, while the function correctly computes the GCD for valid inputs, it lacks validation for the input constraints and does not utilize the variable `c` at all.
