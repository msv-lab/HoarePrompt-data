The annotated program is incorrect based on the problem description provided. Let's analyze it carefully.

### Problem Description Analysis
Mishka wants to ensure that after choosing three time intervals \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) to switch on three garlands (with intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \)), there is at least one garland lit at every second after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). The goal of the program is to determine if such a choice of intervals is valid.

### Annotated Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   The program reads three integers \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \).

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation:**
   ```python
   lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
   ```
   This line attempts to calculate the LCM of \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) using the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the formula used is incorrect for obtaining the LCM. The correct relationship should be:
   \[
   LCM(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{GCD(a, b)}
   \]
   The way LCM is calculated for three numbers should be done pair-wise, but here the calculation is flawed.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   The condition checks if:
   ```python
   if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
   ```
   This checks whether the LCM is divisible by \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \). While this sounds relevant, given that the LCM was incorrectly calculated, this check does not guarantee the conditions set forth in the problem statement.

### Issue with the Program
- The program incorrectly calculates the LCM. Even if this calculation were correct, checking the divisibility of the LCM by \( k_i \) does not directly correlate with the need to verify that for every second after the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \), at least one garland is lit. 
- Additionally, the program does not directly evaluate the intervals of the garlands being able to alternate in a way to ensure coverage in all seconds as required by the problem.

### Example Test Cases
1. **Input:** `2 2 3`
   - Correct answer expects `YES` as possible intervals can make sure at least one garland lights every second.
   
2. **Input:** `4 2 3`
   - Correct answer expects `NO` as there will be seconds when no garland is lit.

The current implementation does not correctly ascertain these cases due to an erroneous formula and checks.

### Conclusion
The program fails to accurately implement the solution to the given problem. As such, it does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
