The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it performs operations based on the integer values of `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3`, which must be within the range of 1 to 1500. However, since there are no specific output conditions or return values provided in the output description, I cannot detail the return value or its conditions. Therefore, I can only summarize the parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on integers k_1, k_2, and k_3, which must be within the range of 1 to 1500.**
