The value of `gcd_k1_k2` is assigned the result of `math.gcd(k1, k2)`. The variables `k_1` and `k_2` are integers within the defined range of 1 to 1500. Therefore, `gcd_k1_k2` will be an integer that represents the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers within the range 1 to 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k_1` and `k_2`.**
