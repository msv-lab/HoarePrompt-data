The code `print('NO')` does not change any variable but outputs the string 'NO'. It means the program is signaling that a certain condition is not met or that the output result is negative. The previous states of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions defined in the initial state are still valid.

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers within the range 1 to 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k_1` and `k_2`; `gcd_all` is equal to `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k_3)`, and `gcd_all` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'.**
