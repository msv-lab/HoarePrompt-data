The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. The variables `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` remain unchanged, and the current value of `gcd_all` which is 1 is not modified by the print statement. 

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers within the range 1 to 1500; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k_1` and `k_2`; `gcd_all` is equal to `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k_3), current value of `gcd_all` is 1; 'YES' is printed.**
