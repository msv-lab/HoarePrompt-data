Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program incorrectly uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to determine whether at least one garland will be lit during every second after switching them on. The logic fails in cases like `(2, 2, 4)`, where despite the GCD being `2` and the program outputting `NO`, there are valid moments (`x1 = 1`, `x2 = 1`, `x3 = 1`) that would ensure at least one garland is lit during every second. Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement for all potential inputs. The GCD approach does not cover the possible overlapping activation of garlands to ensure continuous lighting, leading to incorrect outputs.
