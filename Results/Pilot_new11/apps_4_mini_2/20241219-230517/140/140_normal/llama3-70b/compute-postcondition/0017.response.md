Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, and `graph[node]` has at least two neighbors left unvisited. If `neighbor` is unvisited and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, it indicates that there are valid neighbors left unvisited for `node`. If `neighbor` is already visited, there are no changes. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function confirms that the current node has unvisited neighbors for exploration.***
