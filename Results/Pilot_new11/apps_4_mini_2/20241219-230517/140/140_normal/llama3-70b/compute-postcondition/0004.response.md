Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, `visited` includes `node`, `rec_stack` includes `node`, and `visited[neighbor]` is false for the current neighbor. The result of `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` is true.***
