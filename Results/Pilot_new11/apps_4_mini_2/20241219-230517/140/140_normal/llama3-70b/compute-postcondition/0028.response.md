Functionality: **The function `func_1` is designed to perform a depth-first search on a directed graph to detect cycles. It takes four parameters: `node` (an integer representing the current vertex being visited), `graph` (a list of tuples representing directed edges between nodes), `visited` (a set of integers that tracks which nodes have been visited), and `rec_stack` (a set of integers that tracks the nodes currently in the recursion stack). The function returns a boolean value: it returns `True` if a cycle is detected during the traversal or if an unvisited neighbor exists that can be explored; otherwise, it returns `False` if all neighbors have been visited without finding a cycle.

The postconditions indicate that if `True` is returned, it may signify the presence of unvisited neighbors or a cycle in the graph; if `False` is returned, it indicates that the node is not part of any cycle. However, the annotations may not fully capture that the function should return `True` upon detecting cycles and not solely for traversal states. The code does not explicitly check for valid indices in the `graph` input, which could lead to errors if an invalid node is passed or if the graph contains unexpected structures. This could potentially lead to an unhandled index error if the node index exceeds the bounds of the graph representation. Overall, this function efficiently explores the directed graph for cycles, affecting the `visited` and `rec_stack` sets to ensure proper tracking of the search state.**
