The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: 
- `node`: an integer representing the current vertex.
- `graph`: a list of tuples representing the directed edges.
- `visited`: a set of integers containing the visited vertices.
- `rec_stack`: a set of integers used to track the recursion stack of vertices.

After executing the function body, the function has various return statements based on different cases:

- **Case 1**: Returns `True` indicating a valid traversal in the graph from the current node to a neighbor.
- **Case 2**: Returns `True`, indicating that the node has been successfully visited and its neighbors are accounted for in the recursion stack.
- **Case 3**: Returns `True` indicating that there are valid neighbors left unvisited for the given node in the graph.
- **Case 4**: Returns `True`, indicating that the function confirms the current node has unvisited neighbors available for exploration.
- **Case 5**: Returns `True`, indicating that there is at least one unvisited neighbor left for the given valid index `node` in `graph`.
- **Case 6**: Returns `True`, indicating that the current node has at least one unvisited neighbor left in the graph.
- **Case 7**: Returns `False`, indicating that the node has not been identified as part of a cycle in the graph since `rec_stack[node]` is `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a list of tuples `graph`, a set `visited`, and a set `rec_stack`, and it returns various boolean values indicating the status of traversal, visitation of nodes, and the existence of unvisited neighbors in the directed graph. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters node (an integer), graph (a list of tuples), visited (a set of integers), and rec_stack (a set of integers) and returns True or False based on the traversal and visitation status of nodes in the directed graph.**
