Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, `graph[node]` has at least two neighbors left unvisited, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in the list of neighbors for `node`. If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True, confirming that the current node has unvisited neighbors available for exploration.***
