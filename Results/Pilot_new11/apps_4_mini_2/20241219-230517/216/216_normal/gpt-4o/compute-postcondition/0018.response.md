The `current_count` variable is incremented by 1. The value of `current_count` was previously determined based on whether `char` is a lowercase letter (set to 1) or not (set to 0). Since `current_count` is being increased by 1, it can now either be 2 (if `char` was a lowercase letter) or 1 (if `char` was not). Other variables such as `n`, `s`, `char`, and `current_set` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_count` is either 2 (if `char` is a lowercase letter) or 1 (if `char` is not), `current_set` may now include `char`.**
