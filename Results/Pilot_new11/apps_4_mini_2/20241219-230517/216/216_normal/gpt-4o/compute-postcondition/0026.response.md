The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1, while `n`, `s`, `char`, `current_set`, and `max_count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, `current_set` has `char` added to it, `current_count` is increased by 1, `max_count` remains unchanged.
