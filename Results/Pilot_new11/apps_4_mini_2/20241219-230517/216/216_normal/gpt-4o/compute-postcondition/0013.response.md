The `current_set.clear()` method is called, which clears all elements from the `current_set`. Since `current_set` was initially an empty set, its state remains unchanged after the execution of the code. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and `char` is not a lowercase letter.**
