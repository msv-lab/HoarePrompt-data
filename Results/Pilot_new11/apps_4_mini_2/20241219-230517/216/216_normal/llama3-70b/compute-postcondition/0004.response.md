The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 200, representing the length of the string `s`. The function also accepts another parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Based on the output, the function processes these inputs but the specific return value is not provided in the instruction. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` while ensuring `n` is within the specified range and `s` contains valid characters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of string s, and a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.**
