The values of `nx` and `ny` are assigned based on the calculations involving `v` and `y`. Specifically, `nx` is calculated as the integer division of `(v - 1)` by `y`, and `ny` is calculated as the remainder of `(v - 1)` when divided by `y`. 

Since we know that `v` is the third element of the list `a`, it holds a specific integer value from that list, and `y` is a separate integer (which is not defined in the initial state). 

Given that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200000`, and `a` has at least 3 elements, the calculations for `nx` and `ny` will yield specific values:

- `nx = (v - 1) // y`
- `ny = (v - 1) % y`

However, the exact values of `nx` and `ny` cannot be determined without the specific values of `v` and `y`. Still, it is clear that both `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on the calculations.

After executing the code, the values of `nx` and `ny` will be dependent on the values of `v` and `y`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements; `v` is the third element of the list `a`; `nx` equals (v - 1) // y; `ny` equals (v - 1) % y; `px` is now equal to `nx`; `py` is now equal to `ny`.**
