Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `v` is the third element of the list `a`; `nx` equals (v - 1) // `y`; `ny` equals (v - 1) % `y`; `px` is now equal to `nx`; `py` is now equal to `ny`. If the sum of the absolute differences `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the program returns False.***
