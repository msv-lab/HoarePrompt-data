Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `v` is the first element of the list `a`, `nx` is (a[0] - 1) // y, `ny` is (a[0] - 1) % y. The current value of `nx` and `ny` are such that the sum of the absolute differences between `nx` and `px`, and between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1.***
