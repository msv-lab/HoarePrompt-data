You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.


-----Examples-----

1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

3 3

1 2 1 2 5 3

-----Note-----

The matrix and the path on it in the first test looks like this: [Image] 

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem description in all potential cases. Specifically, there is a flaw in how valid matrix dimensions (`x` and `y`) are determined based on the path taken through the matrix.

Potential issues arise from the current constraints and logic used in the nested loops:

1. The outer loops iterate over `x` and `y` from `1` to `1,000,000`. However, the program terminates once `x * y > max(a)`, which prevents it from adequately mapping all possible configurations of `x` and `y` that satisfy the conditions without prematurely breaking.

2. The program moves to check each value `v` in the path `a` against the derived coordinates `(nx, ny)` without expanding the conditions for the cases where `x * y` finds valid configurations beyond just the maximum of `a`. The loop's condition can potentially break without checking all necessary sizes of `x` and `y`.

For example, consider the path:
```
1 2 3 4
```
Given this path, even though `max(a) = 4`, the program might incorrectly determine a contradiction without exploring adequate dimensions that can accommodate such a path.

There exist matrix configurations for input sequences where the coordinates can validate moves but are not assessed due to the flawed condition checking in the loops. As a case of failure, a simple input:
```
n = 4
a = [1, 2, 3, 5]
```
Given this path, a valid 2x3 matrix (for example) exists, which the program would output as "NO" due to premature loop exit conditions, demonstrating incorrectness.

In summary, the logic in the program doesn't fully account for all possible configurations that match valid movement paths in the specified matrix, leading to potential misjudgments on whether a successful configuration is possible.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the dimensions of a hypothetical matrix. It checks the validity of a sequence of coordinates derived from a global list `a`. Specifically, it iterates through each value in the list `a`, converting each integer into matrix-like coordinates (`nx`, `ny`). The function verifies that the movement from one coordinate to the next (calculated from adjacent elements in `a`) is a valid step (specifically, a step to an adjacent cell in the matrix). If any step does not conform to this criterion, the function returns `False`. If all steps are valid, it returns `True`. Notably, the code lacks validation for the input list `a`, including checks for its length or whether all elements in `a` fall within the specified range. Additionally, the initial values of `px` and `py` are conditionally referenced but could be affected by the list `a`, which is assumed but not guaranteed to be defined within the scope. Therefore, there could be a risk of reference errors if `a` is not provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
