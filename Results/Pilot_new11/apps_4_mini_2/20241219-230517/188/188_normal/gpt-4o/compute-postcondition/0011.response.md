The code invokes a print statement, meaning it outputs 'NO' to the console but does not modify any variables or their values in the program. The values of `n`, `cards`, `count`, and `unique_numbers` remain unchanged from their initial state; however, the output of the program indicates the result.

Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `cards` is a list containing `n` integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency distribution of `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique keys from `count` based on their frequency; the printed output is 'NO'.**
