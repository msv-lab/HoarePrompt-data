The provided program aims to determine if Petya and Vasya can choose distinct integers such that they can take all `n` cards evenly. The program utilizes a frequency counter to evaluate conditions based on the counts of unique integers present on the cards.

Upon analyzing the code and the output hints, the following points are noted:

1. **Unique Card Count Check**: The program correctly checks if there are fewer than two unique card values. If so, it prints 'NO' as required by the problem description.

2. **Frequency Condition**: The critical part of the logic checks if the two most frequent unique card numbers both appear exactly `n // 2` times. This is essential for ensuring that both players can receive an equal number of cards.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where all cards have the same value by directly checking the length of unique card values, returning 'NO' if there is less than two. It also accurately assesses the frequency count, returning 'NO' if it's not possible to partition the cards evenly.

However, there is a flaw in the program's logic:

- It only considers the two most frequent card values when the number of unique values is greater than or equal to two. In scenarios where there are more than two unique values present, if the two most common values each appear exactly `n // 2` times, it outputs 'YES' with those values. This means that if there are other values present, they won't affect the decision, potentially missing valid combinations. 

For example:
- Input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```
- Expected Output: 'NO' because no two cards can be split evenly.
- The program incorrectly may return 'YES 1 2' if it finds 1 and 2 as the two most common even if they do not meet the even distribution requirement caused by the presence of another pair.

Thus, while the basic structure of the code follows the general intent of the problem, it fails in certain edge cases, making it unreliable.

Correctness: **False**.
