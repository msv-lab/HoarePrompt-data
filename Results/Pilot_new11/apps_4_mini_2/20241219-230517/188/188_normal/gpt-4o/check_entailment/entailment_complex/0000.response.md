To determine the correctness of the provided Python function against the problem description, we can analyze how the function operates:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an even integer `n` and `n` integers representing the cards. This aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Counting Unique Cards**: The function uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in the `cards` list. This is correct and necessary for checking the game fairness.

3. **Checking Unique Numbers**: The function checks if there are fewer than two unique numbers. If so, it prints 'NO'. This correctly handles the case where players cannot choose distinct numbers.

4. **Game Fairness**: The critical part of the implementation checks the last two numbers in `unique_numbers` to see if each appears exactly `n // 2` times. This check correctly implements the requirement for the game to be fair. 

5. **Output**: If the game is fair, it prints 'YES' and the two distinct integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This meets the output format required by the problem.

Here are the scenarios the algorithm correctly accounts for:

- **Fewer than two unique numbers**: If all cards have the same number, it correctly outputs 'NO'.
- **Not enough cards to make it fair**: If the card counts do not allow for an equal distribution to both players, it also correctly outputs 'NO'.
- **Existence of two distinct card numbers, each counted equally**: It correctly identifies this condition, outputs 'YES', and provides the chosen integers.

### Examination of Edge Cases:
1. **Example with Two Distinct Cards**: 
    - Input: `2, 1, 2` → Outputs 'YES 1 2' (which is correct).
    
2. **Example with All Same Cards**:
    - Input: `4, 4, 4, 4` → Outputs 'NO' (as expected).

3. **Example Without Enough Cards**:
    - Input: `6, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3` → Outputs 'NO'.

4. **Example With Appropriate Features**:
   - Input: `4, 10, 10, 20, 20` → Outputs 'YES 10 20'.

All edge cases that can arise have been accounted for correctly.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles input as expected without errors. 

Therefore, after analysis:

Correctness: **True**
