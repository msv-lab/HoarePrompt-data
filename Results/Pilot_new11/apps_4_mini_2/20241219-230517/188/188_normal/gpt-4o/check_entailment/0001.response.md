Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Petya and Vasya can choose distinct integers such that they can split the cards evenly between them. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4
3
3
4
4
```
In this case, Petya can choose `3` (which has 2 cards) and Vasya can choose `4` (which also has 2 cards). The game is fair as both players end up with the same number of cards, yet the program would print `"NO"` because it checks that the last two unique numbers must each have exactly `n/2` occurrences, treating them as distinct integers. The program does not account for an alternate situation where unique numbers fulfill the criteria for a fair game while having different counts than `n/2`.

Thus, it misses valid scenarios where different numbers appear the same number of times that can lead to a fair game setup. Hence, since the program does not always provide the correct result as per the problem statement, it is deemed incorrect.
