To determine the correctness of the provided code, we must analyze the program based on the problem description.

The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn given a certain amount of time (M minutes) to solve n tasks, each composed of k subtasks. The points earned are calculated both from individual subtasks solved and an additional point if all subtasks of a task are completed.

Let's analyze the `func_1` function:

1. It calculates the total time required to complete one full task (`total_time_per_task = sum(t)`).
2. It iterates through the number of complete tasks Polycarp can accomplish (`complete_tasks`).
3. For each number of complete tasks, it calculates how much time would be used and the corresponding points.
4. It checks remaining time after completing those tasks and attempts to maximize additional subtasks solved within the remaining time.
5. It uses a greedy approach to decide how many subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.

However, there are potential edge cases that might not be handled correctly:

- If `M` is 0, Polycarp cannot solve any subtasks, yet the program calculates points based on tasks that cannot be completed.
- The program does not properly account for exceeding the maximum number of tasks or subtasks (i.e., when remaining subtasks exceed the total available tasks post-completion of complete tasks).
- In cases where `n` or `k` is at its minimum (like 1), it might lead to unexpected results if there's not enough time. The implementation assumes he can solve at least one subtask each time without checking the limits.
- Additionally, if `M` is less than the smallest subtask time, he canâ€™t solve any subtask (which should lead to a direct output of `0` points). 

**Example Input to Demonstrate Failure:**
- For `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `M = 0`, and `t = [1]`, the correct output should be `0`, but the current implementation would still calculate points from the loops without correctly functioning to output `0` directly in this case.

Based on this analysis, we identify that the program may not function as intended for certain edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.
