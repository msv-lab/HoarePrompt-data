Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 45, `k` is at least 1, `M` is greater than or equal to `time_used`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of a valid `t`, and `remaining_time` is non-negative. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to the remainder after subtracting `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, with `subtask_time` being the next element in `t`. Otherwise, the conditions of the precondition hold true without any changes to the variables.***
