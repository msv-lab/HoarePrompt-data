Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is the maximum possible points achievable based on complete_tasks and subtasks solved, `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `(n * (k + 1))`, `remaining_time` is non-negative or zero (if the total time used is less than or equal to M), and `subtasks_solved` is equal to the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time.**
