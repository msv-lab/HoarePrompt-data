The code snippet modifies the `subtasks_solved` variable by adding `max_subtasks_for_this_task` to it. The initial state indicates `subtasks_solved` is -1 and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is also -1. 

Calculating the new value:
- `subtasks_solved` = -1 + (-1) = -2

The other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state will reflect the updated value of `subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45; `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45; `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9; `t` is a list of at least 3 integers; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `complete_tasks` is 0; `time_used` is greater than `M`; `points` is 0; `remaining_time` is less than 0; `subtasks_solved` is -2; `subtask_time` is the third element in `t`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is -1.**
