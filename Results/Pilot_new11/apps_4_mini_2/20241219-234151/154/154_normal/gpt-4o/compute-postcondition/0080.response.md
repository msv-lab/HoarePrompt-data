The expression assigns `max_points` the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The state of `max_points` will be updated based on the values of `points` and the updated value of `subtasks_solved`, which is previously defined as the minimum of its previous value or `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. Consequently, since the initial conditions are still valid, the output state will reflect any change in `max_points` and the definition of `subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 45, `k` is at least 1, `M` is greater than or equal to `time_used`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of a valid `t`, `remaining_time` is non-negative, `subtasks_solved` is now the minimum of its previous value or `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, and `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`.**
