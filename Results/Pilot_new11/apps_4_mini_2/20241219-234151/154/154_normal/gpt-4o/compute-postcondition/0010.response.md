According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `t`. For the loop to execute, the list `t` must contain at least one element. Given that `k` is the number of elements in `t` and is in the range 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, this ensures that `t` has at least one integer. 

At the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that after evaluating `subtask_time`, the state of `time_used` is drawn from a valid total that represents time allocated, but since `time_used` is already greater than `M`, this indicates that we were possibly using an illegal state before starting. Also, `remaining_time` being less than 0 suggests that there are no remaining resources for subtasks, which will prevent further execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute properly, `subtask_time` needs to represent the time required for the first subtask, which is the first element in `t`. 

Thus, to adjust the states accordingly, we state:
- `t` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer,
- `subtask_time` is the first element in list `t`,
- We need to ensure the loop can execute with a valid context, meaning overall time constraints may need checking based on these adjustments.

State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of at least 1 integer, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is less than 0, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`**
