`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. Given that `remaining_time` is non-negative and `subtask_time` is the next element in `t`, the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will depend on the specific values of `remaining_time` and `subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 45, `k` is at least 1, `M` is greater than or equal to `time_used`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of a valid `t`, `remaining_time` is non-negative, `subtask_time` is the next element in `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
