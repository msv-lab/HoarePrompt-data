In the provided code snippet, the variable `remaining_time` is computed by subtracting `time_used` from `M`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45
- `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45
- `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9
- `t` is a list of `k` integers
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`
- `max_points` is equal to `max(0, 0 + subtasks_solved)`
- `complete_tasks` is 1
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `points` is equal to `k + 1`
- `remaining_time` is less than 0
- `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`

Now we calculate `remaining_time`:

- `remaining_time` is set to `M - time_used`.
- Since `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, and `complete_tasks` is 1, then `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`.

Thus, we can rewrite the equation for `remaining_time`:
- `remaining_time` becomes `M - total_time_per_task`.

Considering that `remaining_time` was initially less than 0, the new value after execution will reflect this computation:

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, 0 + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - total_time_per_task`, and it is still less than 0; `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.**
