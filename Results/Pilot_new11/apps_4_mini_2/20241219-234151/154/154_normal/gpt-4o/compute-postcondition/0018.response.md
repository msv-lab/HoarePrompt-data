In this code snippet, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The current value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is -1. Thus, `subtasks_solved` will decrease by 1 because adding -1 is equivalent to subtracting 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. The preconditions are still valid, except `subtasks_solved` is now reduced by 1.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of at least 2 integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is less than 0, `subtasks_solved` is -1, `subtask_time` is the second element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is -1.**
