Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that could be solved given the initial `remaining_time` with respect to all subtask times in `t`, and `remaining_time` will be updated accordingly based on the total time used to complete the solved subtasks.**
