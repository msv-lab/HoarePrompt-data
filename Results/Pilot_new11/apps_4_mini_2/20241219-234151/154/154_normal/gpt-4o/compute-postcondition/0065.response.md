`subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, which is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Given that `remaining_time` is adjusted to be non-negative and is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will yield a non-negative integer since integer division of a non-negative number by a positive number results in a non-negative integer. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 45, `k` is at least 1, `M` is greater than or equal to `time_used`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of a valid `t`, `remaining_time` is non-negative, `current value of remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 45, `k` is at least 1, `M` is greater than or equal to `time_used`, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of a valid `t`, `remaining_time` is non-negative, `current value of remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
