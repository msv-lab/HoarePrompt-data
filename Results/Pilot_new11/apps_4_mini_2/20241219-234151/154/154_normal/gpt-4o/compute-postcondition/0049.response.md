To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we begin by examining the relevant variables and their states:

- `n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45.
- `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45.
- `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9.
- `t` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, which implies `total_time_per_task = sum(t)`.
- `max_points` is equal to `max(0, max_subtasks_for_this_task)`.
- `complete_tasks` is 1.
- `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`.
- `points` is equal to `k + 1`.
- `subtasks_solved` is equal to `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.
- `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.

Now, we analyze the code snippet provided, which adds `max_subtasks_for_this_task` to `subtasks_solved`.

The changes happening in the variables:
- `subtasks_solved` will be incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Therefore, the new state of `subtasks_solved` can be represented as:
- Before the code execution: `subtasks_solved = max_subtasks_for_this_task`.
- After the code execution: `subtasks_solved = max_subtasks_for_this_task + max_subtasks_for_this_task = 2 * max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects these variables:

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, max_subtasks_for_this_task)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `subtasks_solved` is equal to `2 * max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
