The value of `remaining_time` is calculated as `M - time_used`. Given that `remaining_time` is initially less than 0, it suggests that `M` is less than `time_used`. Thus, after the calculation, `remaining_time` will still be negative, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing `time_used` and `M`. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `points` is equal to 2 * (k + 1), `remaining_time` is less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` remains 0; `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`.
