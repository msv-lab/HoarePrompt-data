To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop, we consider the conditions under which the loop was executed and the computations that take place within it. 

1. The loop runs for each element in the list `t`. It iterates as long as `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to the current `subtask_time`.
2. Since `remaining_time` starts as a negative value and the code specifies that it must be less than zero initially, the loop cannot execute even once because the condition `remaining_time >= subtask_time` cannot be satisfied.
3. As a result, the values of the variables that started with their initial values won't change during non-execution of the loop.

Now, let's summarize the final output state dependent on the initial defined conditions:

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with k elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, 0 + subtasks_solved)` which remains 0, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is equal to the initial value `M - total_time_per_task` and remains less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
