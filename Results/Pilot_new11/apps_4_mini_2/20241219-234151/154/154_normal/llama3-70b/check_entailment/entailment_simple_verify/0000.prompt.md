You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let us analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:** 
   - `n`: Number of tasks.
   - `k`: Number of subtasks per task.
   - `M`: Total minutes available.
   - `t`: List of integers representing time required for each subtask.

2. **Output:** 
   - The maximum number of points Polycarp can earn in `M` minutes.
   - Points are earned by solving subtasks, with bonus points given for completely solving all subtasks of a task.

3. **Logic to implement:**
   - Solve as many subtasks as possible in a given time `M`.
   - Determine the number of completed tasks to award the extra points.

### Program Analysis:
The logic in the provided program makes use of dynamic programming to calculate the number of subtasks that can be completed in `M` minutes.

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction:**
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved using up to `j` minutes considering the first `i` subtasks.
   - The core idea is that for each time `j`, it checks whether it can include the current subtask at time `t[i-1]`. If it can, then it updates the maximum subtasks that can be achieved.
   
2. **Summation of Results:**
   - The sum of the last rows of `dp` gives the total subtasks completed.
   - Additionally, the program checks how many tasks were completely solved at full `M` minutes and adds that to the score.

### Potential Issue:
- The program does not take into account the number of total tasks `n`. This is a crucial aspect of the problem since it indicates how many tasks can be generated for solving the subtasks.
- There can be scenarios where Polycarp can completely solve subtasks for more tasks than time allows if subtasks are not fully utilized by accounting for `n`.

### Example Case:
Consider an example:
- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 3`, `M = 10`, and subtasks `t = [1, 2, 3]`
  
  - For these inputs, the optimal output should be 5 because:
    - He can fully solve both tasks (1 + 2 + 3 from the first task and 1 + 2 + 3 from the second task totals 12 minutes needed, but only 10 minutes available).
    - However, if he optimally solves 5 subtasks in 10 minutes from two tasks without the program accounting for limiting to `n`, the behavior would yield an incorrect representation of potential completions. 

In this case, the program fails to correctly account for the maximum number of points achievable, failing to limit the calculations based on `n`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to consider the number of tasks `n` in conjunction with the available minutes `M`, leading to a potential situation where the maximum points calculated breach the task constraints outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 45, k is an integer between 1 and 45, M is a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2·10^9; `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp[k][j]` contains the maximum number of times the items can be used to reach each value from 0 to `M`, reflecting all combinations of the first `k` items.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
