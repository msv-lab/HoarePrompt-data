Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2Â·10^9 (must be greater than 0), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user, and `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then for the current values of `i` and `j`, `dp[i][j]` remains either 0 or is updated to 1, with `i` equal to 1 and `j` equal to 1.***
