According to the provided code, the loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `M` is at least 1, the loop will execute again as `M` contributes to the upper limit of the range.

In the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `M` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
