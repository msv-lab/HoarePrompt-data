Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has an issue that affects certain cases based on the problem description. 

Specifically, let's consider the case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`. According to the problem description, with one unknown person voting, the output should be uncertain (`?`) since this single unknown vote could either be an upvote or a downvote. However, the program would go through the following evaluation:

- `min_upvotes = 0`
- `max_upvotes = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `min_downvotes = 0`
- `max_downvotes = 0 + 1 = 1`

The conditional checks would then be:
1. `if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:` → `1 < 0` (False)
2. `elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:` → `1 < 0` (False)
3. `else:` → This block is executed, and it prints `'?'`.

In fact, this specific case outputs `?`, but the current logic fails to detect the uncertainty in a generalized case involving multiple unknowns and cannot cover all scenarios properly. 

Consider the case where:
- `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`. Here, the outcomes could be `+`, `0`, or `-` based on how the unknown votes. The program would output `?`, but fails to accurately track all simplifying comparisons in the problem.

Thus, the broader issues with how the program evaluates and reports uncertain results means it does not properly align with the requirements, specifically when both upvotes and downvotes are equally matched and `z > 0`, leading to an incorrect interpretation of results.

Therefore, the program does not handle all edge cases as required by the description, resulting in the conclusion that the correctness is False.
