The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The values of `y` and `z` are both within the range 0 to 100, so the value of `max_downvotes` will also be within the range of 0 to 200. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
