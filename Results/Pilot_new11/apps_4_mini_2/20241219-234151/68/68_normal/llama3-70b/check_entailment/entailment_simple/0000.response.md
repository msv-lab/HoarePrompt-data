Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately account for all possible outcomes as stated in the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider situations where the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z) may yield multiple distinct results.

Here is the analysis of the program's logic:

1. The first condition checks if `x > y + z`. If true, it outputs '+', which is correct since this indicates that upvotes outnumber all possible downvotes, including unknown votes.

2. The second condition checks if `x < y`. If true, it outputs '-', which is also correct because it indicates that downvotes exceed upvotes.

3. The next condition is `if x == y`, which splits into two checks:
   - If `z` is 0, it outputs '0', which is correct because there would be an equal number of upvotes and downvotes.
   - If `z > 0`, the program outputs '?'. This case suggests uncertainty, which matches the problem description, as it might lead to different possible results depending on the unknown votes.

4. However, the program lacks a crucial check for scenarios when `x > y` but also `x + z <= y`. This condition would lead to uncertainty and should yield a '?' output. The program doesn't cover this case properly; instead, it would default to printing nothing and not indicating it is uncertain.

For example:
- If `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 1`, there can be two outcomes:
  - If the unknown vote is an upvote: Result could be 2 upvotes and 2 downvotes (output '0').
  - If the unknown vote is a downvote: Result could be 1 upvote and 3 downvotes (output '-').

In this case, there are multiple potential outcomes depending on how the unknown vote is cast, leading to uncertainty, which should be indicated with a '?'.

Thus, since there exist valid input scenarios where the program would fail to provide the correct output as required by the problem description, the program is incorrect.

In conclusion, the program does not handle all cases properly, particularly where the results can vary due to the presence of unknown voters. Therefore the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
