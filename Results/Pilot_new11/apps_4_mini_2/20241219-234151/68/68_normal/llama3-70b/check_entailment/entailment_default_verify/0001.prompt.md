You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program against all possible cases defined by the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The program logic is as follows:

1. It reads three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. Additionally, it checks:
   - If `x > y + z`, it prints `+`.
   - If `x < y`, it prints `-`.
   - If `x == y`, it checks if `z == 0`. If yes, it prints `0`. If no, it prints `?`.
   - Lastly, if none of the prior conditions apply, it prints `?`.

Now, let's analyze potential cases, particularly focusing on edge cases:

1. **Case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`:**
   - Expected output: `0` (there are no votes at all).
   - Program output: The condition `x == y` is true, and since `z == 0`, it should print `0`. Correct output.

2. **Case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`:**
   - Expected output: `?` (the vote could be an upvote or downvote, hence uncertain).
   - Program output: The condition `x == y` is true, and `z != 0`, so it prints `?`. Correct output.

3. **Case where `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 0`:**
   - Expected output: `-` (1 upvote is less than 2 downvotes).
   - Program output: It checks `x < y`, which is true, and prints `-`. Correct output.

4. **Case where `x = 2`, `y = 2`, and `z = 2`:**
   - Expected output: `?` (with two unknown votes, it could become either + or -).
   - Program output: The condition `x == y` is true with `z != 0`, so it prints `?`. Correct output.

5. **Case where `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`:**
   - Expected output: `-` (3 upvotes and 7 downvotes).
   - Program output: It checks `x < y`, which is true, and prints `-`. Correct output.

6. **Case where `x = 3`, `y = 4`, and `z = 2`:**
   - Expected output: `?` (3 upvotes and 4 downvotes, plus 2 unknown). The outcome can still swing to either vote direction depending on how the unknowns vote.
   - Program output: The condition `x < y` is true, and it prints `-`. Incorrect output, as it should be `?`.

From the above cases, we can see that the program fails on specific edge cases where the results could be uncertain due to the unknown votes, particularly when `x` is less than `y` but there are unknown votes.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, with the constraints \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). It outputs a character based on the relationship between these values. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it outputs '+'; if `x` is less than `y`, it produces no output; if `x` equals `y`, it evaluates `z`: if `z` is 0, output is '0', otherwise it outputs '?'. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, without checking the exact value of `z`, it outputs '?'. Finally, if `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, but greater than or equal to `y`, the function does not generate any output. There are situations where there might be no output produced even if conditions are met, which may not have been explicitly captured in the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
