The code provided only prints a '-' character and has no effect on the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state will retain all the initial conditions regarding the variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and the current value of `x` is less than `y`.**
