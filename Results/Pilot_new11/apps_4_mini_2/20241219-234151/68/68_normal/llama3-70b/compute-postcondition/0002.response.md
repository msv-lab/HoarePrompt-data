The code snippet executes a print statement, which outputs the string `'+'`. There are no changes to the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z` in the code, so their states remain the same. The output itself does not affect the state of any variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. The current value of `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x > y + z`). Output is '+'**
