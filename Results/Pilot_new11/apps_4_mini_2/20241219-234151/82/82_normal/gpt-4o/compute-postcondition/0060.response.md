The variable `new_b` is calculated based on the values of `b` and `candidate`. Given that `candidate` can be either `k` or `diff // k`, we evaluate the expression `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

1. `b` is a positive integer.
2. `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, which are both also positive integers since `k` is positive and `diff` is positive.
3. The expression computes the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

The previous variables remain valid post-execution with the new value for `new_b`. Therefore, the output state includes all relevant information:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is greater than 0, `int(math.sqrt(diff))` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is updated to the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is updated to the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.**
