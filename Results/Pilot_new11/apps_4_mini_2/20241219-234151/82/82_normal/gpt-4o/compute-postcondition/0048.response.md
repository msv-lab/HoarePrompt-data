According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. The for loop will execute for each element in this list. The loop variable `candidate` will take on the values of `k` and then `diff // k` subsequently.

At the end of the last iteration, we have to consider the current value of `candidate` and whether there are more elements left in the list to iterate over.

Given that the last executed candidate is `candidate` (either `k` or `diff // k`), and if it has already taken the last value of the list during the last iteration, the loop cannot execute further. However, if we are still at the first candidate `k`, then we can move to the second candidate `diff // k`.

To prepare for the next iteration:

1. If `candidate` was `k`, then for the next iteration we would set `candidate` to `diff // k`.
2. If `candidate` was `diff // k`, then the loop would terminate since there are no more candidates left.

Assuming that we are still executing for elements in the list, let's say, for example, the previous value of `candidate` is `k`. Then we need to update the state for the next iteration to have `candidate` set to `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers with `a` not equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to be equal to `candidate`, `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is updated to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `candidate` is `diff // k`.**
