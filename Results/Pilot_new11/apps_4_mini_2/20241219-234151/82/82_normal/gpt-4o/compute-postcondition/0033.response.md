According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candidate` values that are generated from `k` and `diff`. The variable `diff` is calculated as the difference between `a` and `b`, which means `diff` is positive since `a` is not equal to `b`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, the following states should be considered:
1. The `candidate` list will contain two values: `k` and `diff // k`. 
2. For the loop to iterate at least once, `k` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to `diff`, which is derived from the conditions set for `a` and `b`.

Finally, since `k` is a candidate in the list and needs to allow for the loop to execute at least once, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `k`, along with the calculation of `diff`, should be confirmed.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`, `k` is greater than int(math.sqrt(diff)), `diff` is the positive integer calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.**
