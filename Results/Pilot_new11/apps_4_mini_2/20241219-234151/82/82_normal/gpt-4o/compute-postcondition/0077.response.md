The value of `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The previous state of `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` and `new_b` are defined based on the calculations involving `a`, `b`, and `candidate`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
