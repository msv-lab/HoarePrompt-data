The calculation of `new_b` involves adjusting `b` based on `candidate`. The expression `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` computes the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. 

Given:
- `a` is a positive integer.
- `b` is a positive integer with `a` not equal to `b`.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.
- `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

The value of `new_b` will depend on the values of `b` and `candidate`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer with `a` not equal to `b`; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
