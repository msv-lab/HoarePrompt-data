The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The previous values of `candidate` remain unchanged, and the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer with `a` not equal to `b`; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and now `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer with `a` not equal to `b`; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
