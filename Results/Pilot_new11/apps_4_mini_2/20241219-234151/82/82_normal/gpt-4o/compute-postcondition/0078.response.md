The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The initial condition states that `candidate` is defined as `diff // k`, which is a positive integer since `diff` is greater than 0 and `k` is a positive integer. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`) are unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `min_k` has now been assigned the value of `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` and `new_b` are defined based on the calculations involving `a`, `b`, and `candidate`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
