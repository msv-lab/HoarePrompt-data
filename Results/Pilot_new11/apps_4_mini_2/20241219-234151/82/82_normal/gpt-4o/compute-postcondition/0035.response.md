The value of `new_b` is calculated using the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Since `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`, the value of `new_b` will also be calculated based on that positive value of `b`. The impact of this code only affects the variable `new_b`, while the other variables retain their previous states. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`, `k` is greater than int(math.sqrt(diff)), `diff` is the positive integer calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, and `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`, `k` is greater than int(math.sqrt(diff)), `diff` is the positive integer calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate.**
