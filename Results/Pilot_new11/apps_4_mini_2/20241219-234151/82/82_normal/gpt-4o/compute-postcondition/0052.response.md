The statement `min_lcm = current_lcm` assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The previous value of `current_lcm` is still valid, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `current_lcm` is updated to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is updated to be equal to `candidate`, `new_a` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
