To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and the provided output hints, we will analyze the code and hints for each function.

1. **Function Number 1**: 
   - Code:
   ```python
   def func_1(x, y):
       while y:
           (x, y) = (y, x % y)
       return x
   ```
   - Output Hints: This function is correctly computing the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. Given the constraints \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\), it operates correctly under these limits.

2. **Function Number 2**: 
   - Code:
   ```python
   def func_2(x, y):
       return x * y // func_1(x, y)
   ```
   - Output Hints: The purpose of `func_2` is to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `x` and `y` by using the GCD from `func_1`. The main concern here is the possibility of division by zero, but since `func_1` always returns a positive integer (as both inputs to it are positive integers), it should never encounter div-zero errors in valid cases.

3. **Function Number 3**: 
   - Code:
   ```python
   def func_3(a, b):
       if a == b:
           return 0
       diff = abs(a - b)
       min_lcm = float('inf')
       min_k = 0
       for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
           if diff % k == 0:
               for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                   new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                   new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                   current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                   if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                       min_lcm = current_lcm
                       min_k = candidate
       return min_k
   ```
   - Output Hints: This function correctly identifies a non-negative integer `k` such that the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized. If `a` is equal to `b`, it correctly returns `0`. When `a` is not equal to `b`, it correctly computes potential candidates using the divisors of `diff` and subsequently evaluates the LCM for modified versions of `a` and `b`.

Given all that, we need to check for potential edge cases. The function is designed to explore all potential divisor candidates of the difference vector `diff`. The nested loops with checks for minimum LCM ensure that no potential candidates are omitted. 

However, there is a potential edge case worth noting:
- If `a` and `b` are very close (e.g., `1` and `2`), the loop iterates through divisors correctly; however, nuances in LCM calculations (involving large values) could cause potential inefficiencies, though they will still yield the correct output.

After evaluating the program against the problem description and its requirements, I conclude that the code does indeed function as described.

Therefore, I assert:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program seems to correctly handle the calculations needed to find the expected minimal `k` from the provided inputs, as verified against the problem statement and hint confirmations.
