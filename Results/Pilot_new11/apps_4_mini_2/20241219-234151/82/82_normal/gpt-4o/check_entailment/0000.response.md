To evaluate the program against the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it accounts for all potential cases for finding the smallest non-negative integer \(k\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a+k\) and \(b+k\) is minimized.

### Review of the Provided Code:
1. **Helper Function `func_1`:** This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Helper Function `func_2`:** This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the relation \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. **Main Function `func_3`:** 
   - It checks if \(a\) is equal to \(b\). In this case, it returns \(0\) since the LCM of the same number with itself is the number itself.
   - It calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
   - It searches for factors \(k\) from \(1\) to \(\sqrt{\text{diff}}\).
   - For each factor, it computes the potential values of \(a+k\) and \(b+k\), and finds the minimal LCM for those transformed numbers.
   - The goal is to find the optimal value of \(k\) that minimizes the LCM.

### Potential Case for Failure:
While reviewing the conditions in the main function, it only considers values of \(k\) starting from \(1\) to \(\sqrt{\text{diff}}\). However, there may be cases where \(k=0\) yields the optimal LCM but is not being checked.

**Example Case to Consider:**
- Let \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\).
- For \(k = 0\):
  - LCM(2+0, 4+0) = LCM(2, 4) = 4.
- For \(k = 1\):
  - LCM(2+1, 4+1) = LCM(3, 5) = 15.
- For \(k = 2\):
  - LCM(2+2, 4+2) = LCM(4, 6) = 12.
- For \(k = 3\):
  - LCM(2+3, 4+3) = LCM(5, 7) = 35.

From these evaluations, we can see that when \(k = 0\), the minimum LCM is achieved. Hence, the program misses the case where \(k = 0\) is optimal.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to consider the possibility of the optimal value being \(k = 0\) for any values \(a\) and \(b\) where their immediate LCM when \(k = 0\) is less than or equal to any LCM calculated for \(k \ge 1\).

Correctness: **False**.
