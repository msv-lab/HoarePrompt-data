To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program concerning the given problem description, we will analyze whether the program successfully finds the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to find a non-negative `k` such that `LCM(a + k, b + k)` is minimized.
   - If multiple values for `k` yield the same minimum LCM, we should return the smallest `k`.

2. **Function Explanation**:
   - `func_1(x, y)`: Computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
   - `func_2(x, y)`: Computes the LCM of `x` and `y` using the relationship `LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)`.
   - `func_3(a, b)`: Main function that:
     - Returns `0` if `a == b` (since `LCM(a, b) = a = b` and thus minimizing `k` is trivial).
     - Computes the absolute difference `diff = |a - b|`.
     - Iterates through the divisors of `diff`, calculating possible values of `k` and corresponding LCMs for pairs `(a+k, b+k)`.
     - Tracks the minimum LCM and the smallest `k` that produces this LCM.

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program starts by checking if `a` equals `b`, returning `0` immediately which is correct.
   - It calculates the difference and iterates over all possible divisors of this difference. For each divisor:
     - It computes new values for `a` and `b` adjusted by the divisor, which represents potential values of `k`.
     - It checks LCM for these new values and keeps track of the minimum found.

4. **Considerations**:
   - The program efficiently finds all possible `k` values by iterating up to the square root of the `diff`, ensuring it considers both `k` and `diff // k`.
   - It correctly returns the smallest `k` for the minimum LCM.

### Conclusion
The program aligns directly with the requirements laid out in the problem description:
- It correctly handles the case when `a` is equal to `b`.
- It evaluates all candidates for `k` derived from the divisors of the difference `diff`.
- It correctly computes and compares LCMs, ensuring that the output is constrained to the smallest non-negative integer `k`.

Hence, after thoroughly evaluating the logic and flow of the program against the problem statement and its requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
