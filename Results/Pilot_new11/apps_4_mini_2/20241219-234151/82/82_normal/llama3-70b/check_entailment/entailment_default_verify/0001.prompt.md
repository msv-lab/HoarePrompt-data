You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze what the program is intended to do.

The task requires finding a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The program defines two functions: `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and `func_2` to compute the LCM using these two values.

However, the current implementation does not include the necessary logic to iterate over possible values of \( k \) in order to find the optimal one that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). The functions for GCD and LCM are useful, but without calling them in a loop that checks all values of \( k \), the program will not fulfill the problem requirements as stated.

### Examination:
1. The program lacks a main function or procedural logic to search through potential values of \( k \).
2. It does not return or print any value that indicates the minimal \( k \) found.
3. There is no mechanism to compare multiple values of \( k \) to find the smallest one that yields the minimum LCM.

### Example Case Analysis:
Let's consider the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \):
- The expected output is \( k = 2 \) because:
    \( \text{LCM}(6 + 2, 10 + 2) = \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \)

Let's test this:
- If we use \( k = 0 \): \( \text{LCM}(6, 10) = 30 \)
- If we use \( k = 1 \): \( \text{LCM}(7, 11) = 77 \)
- If we use \( k = 2 \): \( \text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 \) (minimum)
- Continuing to \( k = 3 \), \( k = 4 \), and so on will yield larger values.

Thus the minimal k and LCM is found when \( k = 2 \).

However, since the program does not have the logic to perform this search:
- It will not output anything.
- It will not find the optimal \( k \).
- Therefore, it will not meet specifications given in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to fulfill the task because it does not incorporate the mechanism to evaluate \( k \) increments and compute LCMs. Hence, even though the individual functions work fine, without a driver for these functions to achieve the final result requested, the implementation is incomplete and incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are constrained by the condition that they must be at least 1 and at most 10^9. It returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b`, then dividing that product by the result of another function, `func_1`, applied to the same parameters `a` and `b`. It is assumed that `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero integer to avoid division by zero; however, the code does not explicitly handle the case where `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, which could lead to a runtime error. Therefore, the function may encounter an error in such a scenario, indicating that the final state of the program could be an error state if `func_1` returns zero. If `func_1` does not return zero, the function performs the multiplication and division as described and returns the resultant value.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
