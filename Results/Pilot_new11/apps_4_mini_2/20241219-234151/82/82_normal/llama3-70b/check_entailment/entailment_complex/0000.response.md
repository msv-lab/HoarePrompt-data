To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the program's components and the requirements step by step.

### Problem Summary
The problem requires us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized. The expected output is the smallest `k` that achieves this.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), this function is correct and reliable, returning the GCD effectively.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**: This function computes the LCM using the formula:
   
   \[
   \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
   \]

   Given the workings of `func_1`, it should reliably compute the LCM as long as it does not receive inputs that would lead to division by zero, which, based on problem constraints, cannot happen.

3. **Main Logic**: 
   - The program initializes `k = 0`.
   - It computes the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` using `func_2`.
   - The `while True` loop continually computes the LCM for incremented values of `k` until it finds a situation where the new LCM is not less than the current minimum LCM (`min_lcm`). 
   - When it exits the loop, it decrements `k` by 1 before printing. 

### Edge cases and correctness check:
- The program correctly recognizes the stopping condition when the current LCM is no longer less than the minimum found. However, it decreases `k` after the loop. This is where potential issues arise:
   1. If the first computed LCM is already the minimum, it outputs `k - 1`, which could incorrectly output `-1` if `k` was never incremented in the loop.
   2. The only situation where the loop may break without ever incrementing `k` is when the LCM does not decrease at all for `k = 0`. 
   3. This would happen, for example, when `a` and `b` are the same - in which case the optimal `k` is `0`, leading to potential output `-1`.

### Conclusion
Given that the output of the program can be `-1` in the specific case where `a = b`, this violates the problem constraints, which specify that `k` must be non-negative.

Thus, the program fails to follow the problem description for at least one potential case, where the inputs lead to an output that is invalid under the stated requirements. Therefore, the program does not fulfill its obligations correctly across all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
