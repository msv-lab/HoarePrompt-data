The function accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, representing two numbers in the range [1, 10^9]. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function utilizes a loop that repeatedly assigns the values of `b` and `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. After the loop, it returns `a`, which by that point holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is 0 (though constraints specify they are at least 1), the function would still handle it correctly since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. There are no additional checks for edge cases beyond the given constraints, but the function assumes valid input as specified.
