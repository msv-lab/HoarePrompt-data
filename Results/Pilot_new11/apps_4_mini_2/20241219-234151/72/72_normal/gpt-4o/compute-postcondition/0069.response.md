According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as there are remaining questions, which is determined by the variable `remaining_questions`. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_questions` was greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one more question to process. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_questions` must be decremented by 1, reflecting that one question will be processed in this iteration. Additionally, since the loop is set to run for `remaining_questions`, when `remaining_questions` is decremented, it will still need to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, after one execution of the loop, `remaining_questions` will be adjusted to a value that is still greater than 0, which means it must be at least 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `row` is either `x` or `x + 1` depending on the final `direction`, `direction` is 1 or -1 depending on the final row state, `sergei_questions` contains the count of times the condition `row == x and col == y` was true throughout the iterations, and `max_questions` has been incremented or decremented based on the number of iterations ensuring it reflects the final calculation over all columns processed (0 to m-1)**
