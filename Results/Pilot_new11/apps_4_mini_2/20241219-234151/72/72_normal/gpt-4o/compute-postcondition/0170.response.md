Functionality: **The function reads five integers from the input: n, m, k, x, and y, which represent dimensions and constraints for counting occurrences in a grid-like structure. It computes the maximum, minimum, and total count of specific occurrences based on the position (x, y) and the number of questions (k) processed in a defined cyclic manner. The final output consists of the maximum number of occurrences (`max_questions`), the minimum number of occurrences (`min_questions`), and the total occurrences of `(row == x and col == y)` during the iterations. The function does not explicitly return a value; instead, it prints these results directly. Potential edge cases include handling situations where there is only one row or column, which may affect the calculations of cycles and increments. Also, the computation of `sergei_questions` should accommodate situations where `remaining_questions` may lead to no updates if conditions are not met in the for loop.**
