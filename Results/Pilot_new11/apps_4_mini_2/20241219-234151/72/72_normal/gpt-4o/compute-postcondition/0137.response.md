Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` starts as 0 for the first iteration, `sergei_questions` is one greater than its previous value. If `direction` is equal to 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2` and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, if `direction` is not equal to 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` is -1, then `direction` is now 1 with `row` being either `(x + direction) + 2` or `((x + 1) + direction) + 2.```
