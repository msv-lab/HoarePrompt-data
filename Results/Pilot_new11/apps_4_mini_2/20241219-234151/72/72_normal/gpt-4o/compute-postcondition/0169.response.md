The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters, as indicated by the lack of any parameters in the function definition. However, based on the provided constraints, we can infer the following:

- `n` and `m` are integers that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
- `k` is a positive integer constrained by 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `x` is an integer constrained by 1 ≤ x ≤ n.
- `y` is an integer constrained by 1 ≤ y ≤ m.

Since the output and specific behavior of the function based on these parameters were not provided, we cannot detail the return values or conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts constraints on integers n, m, k, x, and y based on specified ranges, but does not explicitly take parameters or provide a return value as the function definition stands.**
