Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, and `col` is 1. If `direction` equals 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is decreased by 3 and `direction` is set to -1. If `direction` is not 1 and `row` is -1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1 and `row` is increased by 2; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
