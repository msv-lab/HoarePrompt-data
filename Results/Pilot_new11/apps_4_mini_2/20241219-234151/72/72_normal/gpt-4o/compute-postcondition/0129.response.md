Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` starts as 0 for the first iteration, `sergei_questions` is one greater than its previous value, `max_questions` is equal to `initial max_questions + 1`, `row` is either `x + 1` or `x + 2`. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2` and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, no changes occur in this block.***
