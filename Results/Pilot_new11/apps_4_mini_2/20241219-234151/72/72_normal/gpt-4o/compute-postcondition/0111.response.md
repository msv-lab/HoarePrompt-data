The code `max_questions -= 1` decrements the value of `max_questions` by 1. The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `remaining_questions`, `col`, `row`, `x`, `y`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged.

Since there are no specific values given for `max_questions`, its state is now simply one less than its original value. The exact previous value is not provided, so we can't specify it.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1.**
