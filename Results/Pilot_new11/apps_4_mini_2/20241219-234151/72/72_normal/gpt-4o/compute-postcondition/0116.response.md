Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 2. If `row` is equal to `n`, then `max_questions` is increased by 1 and `row` is updated to its previous value minus 2. Otherwise, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` is equal to -1, then `row` is increased by 3.***
