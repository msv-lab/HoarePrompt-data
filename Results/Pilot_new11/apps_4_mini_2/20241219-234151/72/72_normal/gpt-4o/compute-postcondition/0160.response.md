The operation `max_questions -= 1` decrements the value of `max_questions` by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `remaining_questions`, `col`, `row`, `x`, `y`, `sergei_questions`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1.**
