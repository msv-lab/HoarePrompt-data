Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, and `col` is 0. If `direction` is 1 and `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is set to `n - 2`, `direction` is set to -1, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1. If `direction` is not 1, then `row` is updated to 1, `direction` is set to 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1 only if the initial value of `row` was -1, while the other preconditions remain unchanged.***
