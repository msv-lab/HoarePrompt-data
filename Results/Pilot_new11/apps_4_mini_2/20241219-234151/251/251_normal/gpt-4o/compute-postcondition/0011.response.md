According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range determined by `i`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which is greater than 0, and `i` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Hence, `j` will become 2.

Since `i` is a positive integer, for the loop to continue executing, it must also hold that `j` is still less than `i`. Thus, the current value of `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2.**
