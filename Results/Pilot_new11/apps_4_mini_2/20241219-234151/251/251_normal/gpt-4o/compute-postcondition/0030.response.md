According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i`, which determines the range for the loop. The loop is defined to iterate `j` from `0` to `i - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than `0`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer, we can infer that `i_prev` must be at least `-1` for `i` to be a valid index. Since `i` is defined as `i_prev + 2`, this means that `i_prev` must be at least `-1` to ensure that `i` is at least `1`.

Hence, to ensure the loop executes:
- `i` must be greater than 0. 
- Since `i` is defined as `i_prev + 2`, `i_prev` must be at least `-1`.
- At the beginning of the loop, `j` will start from `0`, and therefore `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, which should also be properly initialized before the loop.

So the adjusted states should reflect these conditions. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev + 2` (where `i_prev` must be at least -1), `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, `j` is 0**
