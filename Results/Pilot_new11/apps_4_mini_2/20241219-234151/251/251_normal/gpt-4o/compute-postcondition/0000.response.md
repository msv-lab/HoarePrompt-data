`data` is assigned the value of the split input string, which creates a list of strings from the input. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `cakes` also remains unchanged as no code modifies it directly. The variable `data` will contain the input values as strings. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `data` and retains the original states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, `cakes` is a list of tuples (r_i, h_i) for i in the range [0, n-1], and `data` is a list of input strings split from the input.**
