The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])` updates the value of `dp[i]`. Given that `dp[i]` is initially equal to `volumes[i]`, we need to consider both sides of the `max` function.

1. `dp[i]` starts with the value `volumes[i]`.
2. `dp[j]` is still valid as it's unaffected by the current operation; its value remains unchanged.
3. Since `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, it implies that `dp[j] + volumes[i]` will yield a value greater than `volumes[i]`.

Since `dp[j]` is not specified but is valid and affects the calculations, we can state:
- Let `dp[j]` be represented as `x`, where `x` is some value that combines with `volumes[i]`.

The `max` function then evaluates:
- One side: `volumes[i]`
- The other side: `x + volumes[i]` which is greater than the first since `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` suggests `dp[j]` is possibly a positive contribution.

As a result, `dp[i]` will be updated to `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `j` is 0, `dp[i]` is now `dp[j] + volumes[i]`, and `dp[j]` remains unchanged.**
