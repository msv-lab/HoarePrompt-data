According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`, which iterates from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, meaning that the loop has completed its iterations and `j` can no longer run. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to be `i`, and `i` must be greater than 0 to allow for at least one iteration. 

Thus, at the moment, `volumes[j]` must be less than `volumes[i]`, and since `j` is currently equal to `i`, this state must be reflected as we prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]` and `j` must be less than `i` (meaning it is 0, since `j` can be incremented back to 0), `i` should be greater than 0.**
