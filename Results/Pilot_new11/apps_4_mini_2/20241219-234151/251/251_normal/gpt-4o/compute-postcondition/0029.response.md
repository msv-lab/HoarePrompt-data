The `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `volumes[i]`. The previous value of `dp[i]` could have been the maximum value obtained by evaluating `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1` where `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`. However, after this assignment, `dp[i]` now solely equals `volumes[i]`, thus if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to the previously calculated values from `dp[j] + volumes[i]`, that information is no longer valid for `dp[i]`.

Other variables remain unaffected in value, and the previous definition for `dp[i]` does not contribute to its new value. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`**.
