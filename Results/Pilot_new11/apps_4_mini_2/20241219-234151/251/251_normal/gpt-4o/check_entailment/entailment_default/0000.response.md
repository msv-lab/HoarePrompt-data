Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic necessary to determine the maximum volume of stacked cakes according to the given problem description. It calculates the volume for each cake using the formula for the volume of a cylinder and employs dynamic programming to track the maximum possible volume of stacked cakes while adhering to the constraints regarding volumes. 

The provided hints accurately describe the functionality of `func_1`, stating that it computes the volumes and checks stacking conditions based on volume comparisons. Also, the constraints for input are met since `n` is always between 1 and 100,000 with valid radius and height values specified. 

The function `func_2` correctly captures input and processes it for `func_1`, as outlined in the problem description. There are no apparent missing cases or logical fallacies based on the hints and description, ensuring that the output adheres to the expected precision. Therefore, the implementation should yield correct results across all specified inputs.
