Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`, where `j` is 1. If the condition is not met, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
