Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list where if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j]` plus `cakes[i][0]`; `i` is incremented for the next iteration, and `j` equals the new value of `i`. If the condition is not met, `dp` remains unchanged.***
