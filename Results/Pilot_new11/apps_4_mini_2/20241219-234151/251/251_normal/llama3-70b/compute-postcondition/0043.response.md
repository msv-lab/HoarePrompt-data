According to the code, the loop will iterate based on the value of `i`. However, since `i` is currently out of range for the next iteration, it implies that `i` is less than or equal to 0, which means the loop will not execute. To allow the loop to execute, `i` must be set to a value greater than 0. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are to ensure `i` is greater than 0, with `j` starting at 0 because it will take on values from 0 to `i-1` during the iterations.

State: **`dp` remains unchanged, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
