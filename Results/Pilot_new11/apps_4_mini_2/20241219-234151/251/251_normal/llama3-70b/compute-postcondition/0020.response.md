Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `dp` is a list containing `n` elements where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, and the remaining elements are initialized to 0.0; `j` is 0. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then the current value of `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + cakes[i][0]`***
