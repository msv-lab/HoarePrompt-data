To determine if the provided Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to verify whether it accurately calculates the minimum number of segments that Sofia must draw with a ruler for a given number of squares `n`.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
- Sofia draws squares, each consisting of 4 segments of length 1.
- To minimize the number of segments requiring ruler use, she can use previously drawn segments as guides.
- The required task is to calculate the minimum number of segments requiring ruler use for `n` squares, with the constraints given.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program accepts a positive integer `n` (number of squares).
2. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the minimum number of segments needed:
   - It iterates through potential factors of `n`, using \( a \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - For each factor \( a \), it calculates \( b \) as \( (n + a - 1) // a \) (which effectively computes \( b \) such that \( a * b \) covers at least \( n \)).
   - It computes the segments needed for the rectangle formed by these factors as \( segments\_needed = 2 \times (a + b) \).
   - It keeps track of the minimum segments required using `min_segments_needed`.

### Checking for Correctness:
The logic used to calculate segments:
- For each pair of dimensions \((a, b)\) where the product is at least \( n \), it checks every possible configuration to minimize the perimeter calculated by \( 2 \times (a + b) \).
- This correctly addresses the need to balance between the dimensions of the squares, ensuring that segments used can be drawn using guides already available.

Given that Sofia has to draw \( n \) squares:
- For 1 square, she needs to use a ruler for 2 segments.
- For 2 squares, the program correctly returns 3 segments.
- For 4 squares, it should return 4 segments.
- The computation fully encapsulates the relationship of segments drawn to the factors of \( n \).

### Summary:
The program iteratively finds every possible combination of dimensions and calculates the minimum required segments that Sofia has to draw with the ruler, which matches the problem's requirements.

After evaluating the problem description against the program's logic and computations, we see:
- The approach taken aligns with telling how many segments require a ruler.
- The implementation handles the constraints correctly without assumption violations.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements presented in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
