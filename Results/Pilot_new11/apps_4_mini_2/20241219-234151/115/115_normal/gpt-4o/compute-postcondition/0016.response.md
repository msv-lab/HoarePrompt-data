Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50; `A` is unchanged; `B` is updated such that `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1 where the corresponding elements in `A` are all equal to 1, and `operations` contains tuples representing the 1-based indices of those updates; if no updates occur, then `B` remains unchanged, and `operations` is still an empty list if no such conditions were ever met.**
