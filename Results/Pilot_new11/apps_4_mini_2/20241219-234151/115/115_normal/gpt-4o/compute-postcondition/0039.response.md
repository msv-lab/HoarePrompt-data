The code assigns the value 1 to the elements of the array `B` at specific indices based on `i` and `j`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, or `j`. The previous values being `j` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 2 remain unchanged after execution. However, the elements `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` will now all be equal to 1. 

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is unchanged, `j` is 1, and `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1.**
