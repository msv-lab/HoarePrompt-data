Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 2, `A` is unchanged, and `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, the tuple `(i + 1, 2)` is added to `operations`, and `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1.***
