The code modifies a multidimensional array `B` at specified indices based on the current values of `i` and `j`. Specifically, it sets the following indices of array `B` to 1:

- `B[i][j]`
- `B[i][j + 1]`
- `B[i + 1][j]`
- `B[i + 1][j + 1]`

The initial state does not provide the exact values of `i`, but all other state conditions remain unchanged since there are no operations that affect those variables. The output state will reflect that the values of `B` at the affected indices have been changed to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `j` is `m - 1`, `A` is unchanged, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1.**
