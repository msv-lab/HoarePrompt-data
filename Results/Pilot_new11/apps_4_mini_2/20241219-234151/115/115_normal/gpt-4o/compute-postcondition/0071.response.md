The loop compares elements of two matrices `A` and `B` at the specified row `i` for each column `j` from 0 to `m-1`. If any pair of elements does not match, the function will return `-1`. The loop will execute `m` times if `m` is greater than `0`. After all iterations have been completed, if no mismatches are found, no return statement is encountered, which means the function completes execution without returning a value.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 1, `m` is non-negative, the values at A[i][j] are equal to B[i][j] for all j from 0 to m-1, and the function completes without returning a value (None).**
