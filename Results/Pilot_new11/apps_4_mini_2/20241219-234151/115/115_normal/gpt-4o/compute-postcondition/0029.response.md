The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given that `i` is `n - 2` and `j` is `2`, the new values computed will be:

- `i + 1` becomes `(n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`.
- `j + 1` becomes `2 + 1`, which simplifies to `3`.

Since `operations` is being modified by adding a new tuple, this affects only the list `operations`.

The initial state of variables that remain unchanged are preserved, and we explicitly mention the change made to `operations`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged; `m` must be greater than 2; `A` is unchanged; `B[n - 2][0] = 1`; `B[n - 2][1] = 1`; `B[n - 2][2] = 1`; `B[n - 2][3] = 1`; `B[n - 1][0] = 1`; `B[n - 1][1] = 1`; `B[n - 1][2] = 1`; `B[n - 1][3] = 1`; `i` is `n - 2`; `j` is 2; `operations` has a new entry `(n - 1, 3)` appended.**
