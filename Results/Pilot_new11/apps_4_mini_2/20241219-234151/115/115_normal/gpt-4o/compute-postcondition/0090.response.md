According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `operations` list. If the list contains at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `operations` must have at least 3 elements. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `operations` must have at least 4 elements. The next operation `op` must be the fourth element in the list.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `m` is non-negative, all elements A[i][j] are equal to B[i][j] for all valid indices i and j if n > 0 and m > 0, `operations` must have at least 4 elements, and `op` is the fourth element in the list.**
