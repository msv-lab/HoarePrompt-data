According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, `j` will be 2 and `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` must be examined for equality. 

State: **`n` is non-negative and at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the elements `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` must be equal.**
