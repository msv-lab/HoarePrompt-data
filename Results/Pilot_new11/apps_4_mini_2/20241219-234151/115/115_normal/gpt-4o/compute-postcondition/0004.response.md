Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a list of `n` lists each containing `m` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a list containing `n` lists each with `m` integers equal to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and the value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.***
