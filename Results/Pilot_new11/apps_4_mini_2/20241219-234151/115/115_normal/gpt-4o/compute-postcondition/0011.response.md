Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50; `j` is `m - 1`; `A` is unchanged. If `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1, and `operations` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, m)`. In all other cases, the state remains unchanged.***
