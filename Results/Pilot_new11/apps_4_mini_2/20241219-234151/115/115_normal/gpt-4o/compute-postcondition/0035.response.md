The code assigns the value of `1` to the elements `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`. Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `j` is `0`, we can detail the assignments as follows:

- `B[n - 1][0]` will be set to `1`.
- `B[n - 1][1]` will be set to `1`, since `j + 1` equals `1`.
- `B[n][0]` (which is `B[i + 1][0]`) will be set to `1`.
- `B[n][1]` (which is `B[i + 1][1]`) will be set to `1`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `operations`, and `j` do not change as a result of this operation. The relevant changes made specifically pertain to the matrix `B`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, `A` is unchanged; `B[n - 2][0]` through `B[n - 2][m - 2]` set to 1, `B[n - 1][0]` through `B[n - 1][m - 2]` set to 1 if conditions are satisfied, otherwise remain unchanged; `i` is `n - 1`; `operations` contains tuples `(n - 1, j + 1)` for every j where conditions are satisfied and is unchanged otherwise; `j` is 0; `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `B[n - 1][0]` is 1, `B[n - 1][1]` is 1, `B[n][0]` is 1, `B[n][1]` is 1**.
