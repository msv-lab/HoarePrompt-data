Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle all cases, particularly cases where matrix A has isolated ones (1s) that cannot be covered by any 2x2 block operations. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

In this case, the ones in matrix A at positions (1,1), (2,1), (1,3), and (2,3) cannot be reached or covered by any 2x2 block operations since there are zeros positioned where the required 2x2 blocks would need to exist. However, the program logic will fail to detect this issue. The `func_1` will look for 2x2 blocks of ones but will not cover isolated ones correctly, and it might return `-1` incorrectly depending on the last check of full matrix comparison.

Additionally, the program does not consider that it can construct 1s in `B` only if the appropriate 2x2 arrangements are found. If they aren't available, the state of `B` could still potentially have zeros while A does not, leading to an ultimately incorrect verification step before concluding the result.

Thus, the program fails to solve the problem for cases where isolated 1s exist and cannot be converted from `B`, resulting in an incorrect output of `-1` despite possible valid configurations for other elements.
