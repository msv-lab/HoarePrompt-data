To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze how the program operates in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Summary:
The task is to transform a matrix `B` (initially full of `0`s) into a given matrix `A` (which contains `0`s and `1`s), using a set of operations that allow us to replace a `2x2` submatrix in `B` with `1`s. We need to check if it's possible to make `B` equal to `A` using these operations and print the sequence of operations, or return `-1` if it's impossible.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n` and `m`, and then the matrix `A`. It properly constructs `A` from the input.

2. **Performing Operations**:
   - The program iterates through possible `2x2` positions in matrix `A`.
   - For each `2x2` submatrix that has all `1`s, it performs an operation by modifying matrix `B`, setting the corresponding positions to `1`, and storing the operation coordinates.
   
3. **Verification**:
   - After attempting to transform `B`, it checks if every element in `B` matches the corresponding element in `A`.
   - If any discrepancy is found, it returns `-1`. 
   - If `B` matches `A`, it outputs the number of operations and the list of operations.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The design effectively implements the transformation needed to create `A` from `B` as described in the specification:
  - It checks all potential `2x2` areas in `A` and updates `B` only when all four corresponding positions in `A` are `1`.
  - The program does not update `B` unless it is valid to do so, preserving the integrity of `A`.

- The check that follows ensures that if there are any remaining `1`s in `A` that couldn't be matched by a valid `2x2` operation in `B`, the program accurately identifies that transformation is impossible and returns `-1`.

- Edge cases, such as all zeros in `A`, are handled correctly by not performing any operations on `B`, thus maintaining its initial state.

- As defined, the program can also handle scenarios where there's no `1` at all in `A`, returning `0` operations correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the requirements of the problem description and handles all cases correctly, including edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is validated.

Correctness: **True**
