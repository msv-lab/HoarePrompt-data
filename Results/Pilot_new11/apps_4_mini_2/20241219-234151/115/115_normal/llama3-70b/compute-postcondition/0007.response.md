Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If the values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, we continue to the next iteration if inside a loop. Otherwise, no action is taken as there is no else part defined.***
