The code snippet appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are not directly mentioned in the Initial State. However, we can infer that `i` is likely being used within some loop or context to represent a position in the 2D array `A`.

Since `ops` is updated with `(i + 1, j + 1)` and assuming the preconditions about `n`, `m`, and `j` hold, `ops` will now contain coordinates that correspond to one row and one column down from a given `i` and `j`.

The states of the other variables are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State highlighting that `ops` has been modified is: 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `j` is 1, and `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**.
