The code initializes the variable `ops` as an empty list. The values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them; it only introduces a new variable. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ops` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on input such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50; `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, where `A` is populated with integers from user input; `ops` is an empty list.**
