The code snippet appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, so we can state that `i` is an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 2; `ops` includes the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 2; `ops` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
