According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means `j` can be increased by 1 to become 1 for the next iteration. For `j` to be valid for the next iteration, `m` must be greater than 2 (since `m` must be at least 3 for `m - 1` to be greater than 0).

The state to be adjusted, therefore, is `j` which will become 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.**
