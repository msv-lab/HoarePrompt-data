The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the state only refers to variables and their values without any mention of a loop, we infer that while we continue within a potential loop, no variables are altered as a result. The values in the current state remain intact as no assignments or calculations are made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, and we continue to the next iteration if inside a loop.**
