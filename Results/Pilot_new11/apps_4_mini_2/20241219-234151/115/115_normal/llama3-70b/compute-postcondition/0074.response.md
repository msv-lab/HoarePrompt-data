Functionality: **The function processes a 2D list `A` of integers with dimensions `n x m`, where `n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, and each element is either 0 or 1. It identifies positions in a 2x2 section of the list where at least one of the elements is 1 and stores the 1-based coordinates of those positions in the list `ops`. If the count of identified positions exceeds 2500, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the count of valid positions followed by the coordinates of each position stored in `ops`. The function does not handle cases where the input does not comply with the specified constraints, nor does it validate the content of the input list `A` beyond the assumption that it contains integers 0 and 1.**
