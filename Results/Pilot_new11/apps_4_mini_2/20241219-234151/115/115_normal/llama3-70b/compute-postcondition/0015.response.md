Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`. If `A[0][1]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[0][2]`, and `A[1][2]` are both 1, then `ops` contains the tuples (1, 1) and (1, 2). If any of the conditions regarding `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` being equal to 1 are satisfied, then the tuples (1, 1) and (1, 2) are added to `ops`. No changes are made otherwise.***
