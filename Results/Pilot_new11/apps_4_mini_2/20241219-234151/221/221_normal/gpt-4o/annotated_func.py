#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `s`, a positive integer within the range [2, 10^12], and `x`, a non-negative integer within the range [0, 10^12]. It performs a series of XOR operations on two implicit variables, `a` and `b`, though `b` is not initialized or defined before being used. This suggests that the function may not operate correctly as written. After execution, while the final values of `a` and `b` depend on their states prior to the function call, at least one value (`b`) is left in an undefined state, suggesting potential errors. Importantly, the function does not return a value, indicating that its primary purpose may be the manipulation of variables or side effects rather than producing an output. Additionally, since there are no explicit actions regarding `s`, its handling remains completely unaddressed in the function, leaving its impact unexplored.
