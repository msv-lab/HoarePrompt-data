The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters, as the definition does not include any input parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided constraints, it implicitly relates to two variables: `s` and `x`. `s` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12. 

The output of the function is unspecified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact behavior or return values. Therefore, we can only state the accepted constraints based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts `s` as a positive integer where 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and `x` as a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12. The specific return value is not provided.**
