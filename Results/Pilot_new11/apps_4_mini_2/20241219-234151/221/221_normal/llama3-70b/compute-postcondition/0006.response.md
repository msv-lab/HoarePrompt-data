Postcondition: ***`s` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^12, `x` is equal to (1 ^ b), `count` is updated to 1, `a` is 1, and `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^12 - 1, if the condition `a ^ b == x` holds true. If the condition does not hold, the values of `s`, `x`, `count`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
