Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when `t` is greater than `n` correctly as per the problem description. In particular, the computation for how many spectators are standing when `t` is in the range from `n + 1` to `n + k` must account for the fact that participants begin to sit down after all stand up.

For instance, with the input `10 5 11`:
1. At `t = 11`, according to the process described, the first spectator who stood at `t = 1` sits down, while there are still 4 spectators standing (the spectators that stood from `t = 2` to `t = 5`, and those that stood during `t = 6` to `t = 10` remain). 
2. However, the program incorrectly computes this as `n + k - t`, resulting in `10 + 5 - 11 = 4`, which isn't the expected output.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for all possible input cases. For this reason, the program is deemed incorrect.
