You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

The program is structured as follows:

1. It reads three integers: `n` (total spectators), `k` (maximum number of spectators standing at any given moment), and `t` (time).
2. It checks if the time `t` is less than or equal to `k`:
   - If true, it prints `t`, which represents the number of spectators standing because they stand one by one until the k-th spectator.
3. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`:
   - It prints `k`, indicating that the maximum number of spectators standing has been reached.
4. If `t` is greater than `n`, it prints `n + k - t`, following the pattern of spectators sitting down as new ones stand up.

Now let's consider the edge cases:

1. For `t = 1` through `t = k` (where the program should correctly output `t`).
2. For `t = k + 1` through `t = n` (this should return `k`).
3. For `t = n + 1` through `t = n + k` (the output should decrease starting from `1` down to `0`).

We also need to confirm if the program handles all possible values in its conditions logically. 

Let's take the case where `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 11`. According to the given logic:
- `11` is greater than `n` (which is `10`), so it should calculate `n + k - t`:
\[ 
n + k - t = 10 + 5 - 11 = 4 
\]
This case works correctly.

Now let’s analyze some edge cases:
- For `t = 0`, it should ideally return `0` since no spectators have stood up yet, although the program does not handle `t = 0` since it only considers `1 ≤ t < n + k`.
  
- Let's take another example where `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and `t = 6`. Here:
    - The time `t = 6` is greater than `k` but less than `n`, so it should return `3`.

Observing all conditions and cases, we find that the program fails to follow the specification as it does not define outputs for `t` values that exceed `k` while not exceeding `n` but it fails when `t = 0`. Therefore, this shows that the program does not handle cases correctly and misses logic for top boundary values of `t`.

Thus, we find a specific case (e.g., `t = 0`) where the program does not cater to the complete description provided.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes three positive integer inputs, `n`, `k`, and `t`, satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. It evaluates the value of `t` against `k` and `n` to determine what to print: if `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`; if `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`; and if `t` exceeds `n`, it prints `n + k - t`. The function does not return a value; instead, it outputs the result directly to the standard output based on these conditions. Importantly, the function exclusively prints results and does not store or return these values, which should be noted when considering its overall behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
