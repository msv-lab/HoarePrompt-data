Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly identifies the number of spectators standing at any given time `t` according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program handles each case:

1. When `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it correctly returns `t` because this is the phase where spectators continuously stand up one by one.
  
2. When `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it accurately prints `k` since all `k` spectators are standing during this time and no one has yet sat down.

3. When `t` is greater than `n`, the formula `n + k - t` correctly calculates how many spectators are still standing. This works because, after time `n`, spectators start sitting down in reverse order after reaching the maximum standing count.

All the outputs provided in the examples provided with the problem description align with the behavior of the implemented function. The function covers all conditions laid out in the problem statement. Hence, I conclude that the implementation is correct for all possible cases described.
