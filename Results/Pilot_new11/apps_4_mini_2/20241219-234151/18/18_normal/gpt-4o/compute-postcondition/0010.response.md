The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as input, but it operates based on three positive integers: `n`, `k`, and `t`. The constraints specify that `n` is between 1 and 10^9, `k` is between 1 and `n`, and `t` is between 1 and `n + k`. 

The output behavior is not defined in the provided information, so we cannot specify return values for different cases as there are no descriptions of conditions or return values. Without further details, the functionality can only be stated with the permitted parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and t, which are positive integers subject to the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. The return value is not specified.**
