The `print(k)` statement outputs the value of `k`, but it does not change the state of any existing variables. Thus, the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged from the initial state after the code executes. 

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are positive integers that satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. The value of `t` is greater than `k`, and the current value of `t` is less than or equal to `n`. Value of `k` has been printed.**
