The function takes three positive integer inputs, `n`, `k`, and `t`, satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. It evaluates the value of `t` against `k` and `n` to determine what to print: if `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`; if `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`; and if `t` exceeds `n`, it prints `n + k - t`. The function does not return a value; instead, it outputs the result directly to the standard output based on these conditions. Importantly, the function exclusively prints results and does not store or return these values, which should be noted when considering its overall behavior.
