The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters as the definition shows no parameters in the parentheses. However, it performs computations based on the conditions provided for `n`, `k`, and `t`, which are integers constrained by the following relationships: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.

Based on the output conditional structure: 
- Case_1: If certain criteria involving `n`, `k`, and `t` are satisfied, the function returns a specific result.
- Case_2: If different criteria are met, it returns another result.
- The function might return different messages or values based on the evaluated conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates on integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, returning different values based on their relationships as defined in the conditions.**
