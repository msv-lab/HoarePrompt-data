To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I'll analyze both the program and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The problem outlines a Mexican wave scenario where:
- Spectators stand up sequentially up to `k` at time `1` to `k`.
- After that, as new spectators stand, the previous ones sit down in a cyclical manner.
- The goal is to determine how many spectators are standing at time `t`.

### Analyzing the Program:
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```
- The program uses a conditional to check if `t` is less than or equal to `n`. If true, it prints the minimum of `t` or `k`, which is correct since if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, it directly correlates with the number of spectators standing.
- If `t` is greater than `n`, it calculates `k - (t - n) % k`. This formula is intended to find how many spectators are still standing, but it needs verification against the cyclical pattern described in the problem. 

### Output hints:
The hints suggest:
- For `t <= n`, the output is indeed calculated by `min(t, k)`.
- For `t > n`, it describes a cyclical behavior where spectators sit down after standing, supporting the logic of `k - (t - n) % k`. 

### Validating with Examples:
The examples provided in the problem description are as follows:
- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 3`, the expected output is **3**. The calculation of `min(3, 5)` gives **3**, which is correct.
- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 7`, the expected output is **5**. After the first 10 seconds, the number of spectators standing remains **5**, and the calculation provides the expected result using the second case handling.
- For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 12`, the expected is **3**. The calculation `k - (12 - 10) % 5` yields **3**, which is correct.

### Edge Case Analysis:
- At `t = n`, where all `k` spectators are standing still fits correctly as handled by the program.
- When `t` equals `n + 1`, the formula used `k - (t - n) % k` ensures proper wrap-around based on the cyclical nature of the spectators standing up and sitting down.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis:
1. Every edge case suggested by the description and hints has been addressed correctly by the program.
2. The logic adheres exclusively to the requirements without missing or mishandling any potential cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code follows the problem description accurately, handling all cases as required to determine the number of spectators standing at time `t`.
