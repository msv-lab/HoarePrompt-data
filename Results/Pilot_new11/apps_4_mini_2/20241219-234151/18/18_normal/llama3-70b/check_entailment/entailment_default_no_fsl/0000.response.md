To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze its functionality and output behavior based on the specified inputs and expected outputs.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

**Functionality Breakdown:**
1. The function reads three integers: `n`, `k`, and `t`.
2. It checks if `t` is less than or equal to `n`:
   - If true, it prints the minimum of `t` and `k`.
3. If `t` is greater than `n`, it computes `k - (t - n) % k`.

**Expected Outputs Based on Example Cases:**
- **For `n = 10, k = 5, t = 3`:**
  - `t <= n`, so it should print `min(3, 5)`, which is `3`.
- **For `n = 10, k = 5, t = 7`:**
  - `t > n`, so it computes `k - (t - n) % k`, i.e., `5 - (7 - 10) % 5 = 5 - (-3 % 5) = 5 - 2 = 5`. This matches the expected output.
- **For `n = 10, k = 5, t = 12`:**
  - `t > n`, so it computes `5 - (12 - 10) % 5 = 5 - (2 % 5) = 5 - 2 = 3`. This also matches the expected output.

**Edge Cases:**
- For `t = n` (maximum standing spectators), the program outputs `k` correctly due to the condition `min(t, k)`.
- For `t = n + k - 1`, it also correctly computes how many are still standing.
- If k is equal to n, the logic still holds because it would involve standing spectators cycling out correctly.

**Potential Issue Identified:**
After thorough examination, the provided code correctly handles all cases as given by the problem statement and the examples. However, one potential issue is not explicitly visible in normal cases due to the mathematical computation involved in modulo operations, which is generally safe as long as all inputs comply with the constraints.

The output hints clarify that the program does not handle input validation or incorrect types, but it is noted that we're assuming valid inputs per the problem description. Thus, even if it doesn't handle exceptions, we should assume inputs will be within specified constraints.

**Conclusion:**
Since the program handles all cases correctly given the problem conditions described:

Correctness: **True**
