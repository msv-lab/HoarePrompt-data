The value of `current_node` is updated based on the formula `2 * current_node + 2`. The initial state allows for `current_node` to be either 1 or 2. 

- If `current_node` is 1, then the new value would be `2 * 1 + 2 = 4`.
- If `current_node` is 2, then the new value would be `2 * 2 + 2 = 6`.

Therefore, `current_node` can either be updated to 4 or 6 based on its preceding value.

The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and `2^h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` (must have at least 2 characters), `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is either 4 or 6 based on its previous value.**
