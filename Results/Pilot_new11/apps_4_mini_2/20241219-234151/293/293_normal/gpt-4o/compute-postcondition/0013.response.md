Postcondition: ***`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is between 1 and `2^h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length `h` representing `n - 1`, `current_level` is 0, if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is updated to 1; otherwise, `current_node` is updated to 2 and `direction` is not '0'.***
