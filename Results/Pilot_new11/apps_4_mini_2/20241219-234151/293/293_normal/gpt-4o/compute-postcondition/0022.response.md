The value of `current_node` is updated based on its previous value. If `direction` was '0', then `current_node` is either 3 or 5, which makes the new value either `2 * 3 + 2 = 8` or `2 * 5 + 2 = 12`. If `direction` was not '0', then `current_node` is either 4 or 6, which makes the new value either `2 * 4 + 2 = 10` or `2 * 6 + 2 = 14`. Therefore, the specific value of `current_node` depends on the initial state of `current_node` and `direction`.

Given that `current_node` can take different values before executing the code, I will summarize this in the output state based on the potential values of `current_node`:

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is between 1 and `2^h`; `total_leaves` is 2; `visited_count` is 5; `path` must have at least 3 characters; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is either 8 or 12 if previously 3 or 5 (when `direction` is '0') or either 10 or 14 if previously 4 or 6 (when `direction` is not '0').**
