The variable `ans` is incremented by the value `n // 2 - 1`. Given that `n` is an even integer greater than 1, `n // 2` will yield a positive integer value greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `ans` will be updated accordingly. 

The previous values of the affected variables before the execution are:
- `ans` is 0
- `n` is an even integer greater than 1 

Calculating the new value of `ans`:
- New value of `ans` = 0 + (n // 2 - 1) = n // 2 - 1

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1**
