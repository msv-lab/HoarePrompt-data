Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `h` and `n`, where `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. It computes a value `ans` based on the value of `n` while halving `n` until it reaches 1. In each iteration of the loop, it accumulates either `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2` if `n` is odd into `ans`. The function then prints the final value of `ans`. It inherently assumes that `n` starts from a valid positive integer within the specified range and does not handle cases where input may violate the stated constraints, nor does it account for invalid or negative values for `h` or `n`. Therefore, `h` remains unchanged during execution while `n` will be reduced to 1 after the loop. In summary, the function summarizes a computed result based on the evolution of `n` and outputs that result.**
