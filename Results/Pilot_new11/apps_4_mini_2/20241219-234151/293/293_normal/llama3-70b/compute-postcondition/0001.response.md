`ans` is assigned the value `0`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `ans` is 0**
