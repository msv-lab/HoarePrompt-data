In this scenario, the value of `res` is incremented by 2. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged in this context. 

Since `res` starts at 0, after executing the code `res += 2`, the new value of `res` becomes 2. The range of `n` and the condition that the current value of `n` is divisible by `i` do not change.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9; `res` is 2; `i` is 1; and the current value of `n` is divisible by `i` (n % i == 0).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `n` is divisible by `i` (n % i == 0)**.
