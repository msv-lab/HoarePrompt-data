Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 4 to 10^9. If `i * i` equals `n`, then `res` is set to 3 if `n` is divisible by 3, otherwise, `res` becomes 1. If `i * i` does not equal `n`, the values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged, with `res` previously set to either 4 or 2 and `i` being 3.***
