Correctness: **False**.

The provided program counts the number of divisors of `n` and doubles that count, which does not address the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The program logic does not correlate with the definition of a split, and thus will not yield the correct result for the number of distinct weights of splits. 

For example, when `n = 8`, the expected output is `5`, corresponding to the weights of these splits:
- Weight 1: [8]
- Weight 2: [4, 4]
- Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
- Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
- Weight 5: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]

However, the program will output `4`, as it only calculates the number of divisors, effectively counting weights incorrectly. Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements stated in the problem description.
