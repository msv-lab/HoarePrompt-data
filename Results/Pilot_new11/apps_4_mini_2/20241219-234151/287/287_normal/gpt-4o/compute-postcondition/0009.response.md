The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that initially, `i` is 1, the new value of `i` becomes 2. The values of `num` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 2, and `i` is now 2.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 2, `i` is 2**
