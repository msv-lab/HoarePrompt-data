The given problem description requires a function that finds the number of different weights of splits for a given integer `n`. A split is defined as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sums up to `n`, with the weight being the count of elements equal to the first element of the split.

The provided program, however, calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, not the number of different weights of its splits. 

Output hints clarify that `func_1` computes the number of divisors by checking each integer from 1 to the square root of `num` and counting pairs of divisors. It does not address the splitting or weight concepts at all, which are central to the problem statement.

For instance, when the input is `7`, based on the problem's examples, valid splits are as follows:
- Weight 1: `[7]`
- Weight 2: `[3, 3, 1]`
- Weight 3: `[2, 2, 2, 1]`
- Weight 7: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

Thus, the weights can be 1, 2, 3, and 7, giving four different weights. The program will not output the correct result for this input.

Since the program does not adhere to the problem description and fails to calculate the required output, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.
