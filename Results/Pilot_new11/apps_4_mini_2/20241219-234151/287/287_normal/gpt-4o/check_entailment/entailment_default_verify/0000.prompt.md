You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation.

The problem is to find the number of different weights of splits of `n`. The program defines a function `func_1(num)` which calculates a count based on the divisors of `num`. This approach is not aligned with the requirement to count the number of different weights of the splits.

### Potential Issue
The weight of a split is defined by the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element of the split, and to solve the problem, we need to be concerned with how many such weights can be formed, depending on the integer partitions of `n`.

The program counts the number of divisors of `n` instead, which does not correspond to the split weights as described. For example:
- For `n = 7`, valid splits include:
  - [7] -> weight 1
  - [3, 3, 1] -> weight 2
  - [2, 2, 2, 1] -> weight 3
  - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> weight 7
Thus, the weights collected should be {1, 2, 3, 7} which means there are 4 different weights.

However, running the given program will not yield the correct result as it counts the number of divisors, not the distinct weights determined by the valid splits. 

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the count of different weights of splits of `n`, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.

This is evident because, for any number `n`, the outputs based on counting divisors will not provide the correct weights as illustrated by the discrepancies given in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `num` (1 <= num <= 10^9) as input and calculates the total number of divisors of `num`. It iterates from 1 up to the square root of `num`, checking if each integer is a divisor. If a divisor is found, it increments a count and checks if the divisor pair (i, num // i) is distinct, incrementing the count again if so. The function returns the total count of divisors. After execution, the program's final state reflects that `count` holds the number of divisors of `num`, ensuring it handles the edge case where `num` is a perfect square correctly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
