Correctness: **True**.

The provided program simulates the yearly weight increase of Limak and Bob until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. It correctly implements the weight changes by tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year. The loop continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight, and the `years` counter accurately tracks the number of years required for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob. 

The program has been tested against the provided examples and behaves as expected. In every potential case where Limak's weight starts lower than or equal to Bob's, the program will eventually depict a situation where Limak becomes heavier, as outlined in the problem description. Since all scenarios adhere to the specified conditions, we can confidently conclude that the program is correct.
