The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. It simulates Limak's and Bob's weight changes over the years, with Limak's weight tripled and Bob's weight doubled each year, accurately tracking the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's.

The annotations strengthen the assessment by clarifying the program's state before and after the loop, confirming that Limak's weight will eventually exceed Bob's weight given the initial conditions of `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. The statement that the program does not handle cases where inputs are out of range or equal is irrelevant because the problem ensures the inputs will be valid according to the constraints provided.

Thus, all scenarios presented in the examples, as well as the edge cases where `a` starts at its minimum (1) and `b` at its maximum (10), will yield the expected correct number of years until Limak becomes heavier.

Final: **True**
