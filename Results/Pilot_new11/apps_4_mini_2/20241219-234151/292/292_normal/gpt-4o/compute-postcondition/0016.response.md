The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is implied that the function operates with two integers: `a` and `b`, where `a` represents Limak's weight and `b` represents Bob's weight, constrained such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. 

Since the output conditions based on the weights have not been provided, we cannot define specific return values. However, based on the given constraints, the functionality can be stated.

Functionality: **The function operates with two integers, a and b, representing Limak's weight and Bob's weight respectively, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10.**
