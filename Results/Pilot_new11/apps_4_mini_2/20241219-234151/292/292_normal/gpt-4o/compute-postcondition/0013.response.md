The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `years` is unknown, but it is valid to assume that it can be any non-negative integer since it typically represents a count. The states of the other variables, `a` and `b`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state incorporates the increment in `years`.

Output State: **`a` is between `9` and `270`; `b` is at least `36` and still greater than or equal to `a`; `years` is incremented by 1.**
