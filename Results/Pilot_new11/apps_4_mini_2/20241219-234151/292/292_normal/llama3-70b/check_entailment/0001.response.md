Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem statement. It takes two integers as input representing Limak's weight (a) and Bob's weight (b), ensuring that Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight. The while loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year while keeping track of the number of years.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when both a and b start at equal weight; it appropriately calculates the next weights after one year. All the provided example cases confirm that the program produces the correct output for every scenario described.

Since I cannot find any case where the program would fail to correctly identify when Limak's weight surpasses Bob's, I conclude that the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.
