The variable `a` is assigned the value of 3 times its previous value. Given that `a` is initialized with the statement `a is 3 * a`, its initial value is indeterminate. However, after executing the operation `a *= 3`, `a` will now be three times its previous value. 

The variable `b` must still be at least `3 * a` after the execution, and `years` remains unchanged at 2.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a` and maintains the condition of `b` and the unchanged value of `years`.

Output State: **`a` is now `3 * (3 * a)`; `b` must be at least `3 * a`; `years` is 2**.
