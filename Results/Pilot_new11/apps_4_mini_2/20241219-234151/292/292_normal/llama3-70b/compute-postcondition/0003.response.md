The variable `a` is multiplied by 3. The value of `a` is an input integer and is constrained such that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, which means `a` is at least 1 and at most 10. The variable `years` remains unaffected in this operation. After performing the operation, the new value of `a` is `3 * a`, while `b` and `years` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State reflects the changes made to `a`:

Output State: **`a` is equal to `3 * a`, `b` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, `years` is 0**
