Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully comply with the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, it ignores movements in the "West" and "East" directions entirely, which is acceptable because the problem only mentions that Limak moves from the North Pole to the South Pole, but it also does not accurately handle cases where these movements can affect the scenario's validity.

For example, if the input allows for moves "West" or "East," the program should account for any invalid moves toward those directions, especially when Limak is at extreme latitudes (like the North or South Pole). 

Moreover, there are cases where the program will incorrectly output "YES" or "NO" based on the latitude checks and ignores potential logical errors in movements. For instance, if Limak starts moving South but then makes a subsequent movement that does not align with the conditions specified (like if he ends with "East" movements while still needing to return North), this is not correctly reflected in the current implementation.

A specific counterexample could be:
- Input: 
```
3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North
```
The expected output should be "NO" because while he starts at the North Pole and moves South, an invalid East move is made without any checks, which could be problematic in a different scenario. The function would still return "YES" for this input erroneously.

Thus, the conditions set by the problem are not thoroughly addressed in practical scenarios, leading to various paths of incorrect correctness by the overall logic of latitude management.
