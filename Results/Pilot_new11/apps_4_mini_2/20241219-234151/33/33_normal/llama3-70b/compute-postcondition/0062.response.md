The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer within the range of 1 to 50. Alongside `n`, it accepts multiple journey parts, where each journey part consists of an integer `t_i` (representing time) and a direction `dir_i` (which can be one of the strings "North", "South", "West", or "East"). 

The function processes the journey parts and ultimately returns output based on the provided inputs. As there are no specific output cases detailed in the provided information, the exact nature of the return value remains unspecified but can be inferred to involve the processing of direction and time.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and multiple journey parts consisting of an integer `t_i` (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a direction `dir_i` ("North", "South", "West", or "East"), processing this information to produce a result based on the journey's directions and times.**
