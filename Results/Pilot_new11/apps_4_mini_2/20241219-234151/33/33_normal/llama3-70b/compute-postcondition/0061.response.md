The code checks whether `curr_lat` is equal to 90. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Given the defined conditions for `curr_lat`, if `curr_lat` were 90, the print statement would output 'YES', but if it is any other value (including negative), it will print 'NO'. As the program was stated to execute without termination and there was no 'NO' printed during execution, we can infer that `curr_lat` must have been 90.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `curr_lat` is 90, and that 'YES' was printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is 90; 'YES' was printed.**
