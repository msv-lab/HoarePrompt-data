Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, then the program has printed 'NO' and exited. If `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], then `curr_lat` is updated based on the direction specified by `dir`, or it remains at 90 if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South'. The current value of `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North'.***
