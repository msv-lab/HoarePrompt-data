The values of `t` and `dir` are assigned the result of `input().split()`, meaning `t` is now getting the first part of the input (as a string) and `dir` is getting the second part (also as a string). The values of `n` and `curr_lat` remain unchanged. 

Since `t` is expected to be an integer, there is a possibility that the code should convert it based on the scenario. However, we acknowledge that `t` just takes the input as is, for now.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is a string assigned from input; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
