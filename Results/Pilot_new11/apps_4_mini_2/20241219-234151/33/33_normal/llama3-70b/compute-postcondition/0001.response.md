The variable `curr_lat` is assigned the value of 90. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer in the range between 1 and 50, and the journey parts are defined with `t_i` and `dir_i`, but those are not directly affected by the current code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6; `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", or "East"; `curr_lat` is 90**
