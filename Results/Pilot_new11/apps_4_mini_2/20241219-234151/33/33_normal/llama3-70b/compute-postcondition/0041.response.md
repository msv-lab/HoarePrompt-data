The code `exit()` terminates the program execution immediately without changing any variable states. The existing values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged. The execution is also terminated with output 'NO'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged or is within the range of -90 to 90; program execution is terminated with output 'NO'.**
