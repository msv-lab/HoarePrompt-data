According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is an integer with a range of 1 to 50. The states provided indicate that `n` is already defined within this range, ensuring the loop will execute. The loop variable `_` does not need to be modified, as it is typically used to indicate that the value is not needed in the loop body. 

There are no additional conditions that need to be fulfilled for the loop to execute based on the provided states. 

However, for clarity on the states at the beginning of the loop with respect to `curr_lat`, it is informative to note that it remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations, and it's initialized at its maximum negative value.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `n` is valid and that `curr_lat` begins at an initial defined value. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90**
