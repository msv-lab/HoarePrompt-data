Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then 'NO' has been printed and the program has exited. Additionally, `curr_lat` is currently 90 and `dir` is not 'South'. `curr_lat` may remain at 90 or update based on the specified direction.***
