The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that the program will stop execution and none of the variables will be modified. The existing values for `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged. The output 'NO' has been printed before calling `exit()`, and since the program is terminating, there are no further calculations or changes to note.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; the output 'NO' has been printed.**
