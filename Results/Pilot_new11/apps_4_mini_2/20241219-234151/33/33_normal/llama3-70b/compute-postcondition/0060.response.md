Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is in the range of -90 to 90; if `curr_lat` is 90, then the input direction must have been 'South' at least once; if `curr_lat` is -90, the input direction must have been 'North' at least once; the program executes without termination, meaning neither 'NO' was printed during execution nor did the program exit prematurely.**
