Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then 'NO' has been printed and the program has exited. If `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90] and meets any other conditions, it may update based on the specified direction or remain at 90, as applicable.***
