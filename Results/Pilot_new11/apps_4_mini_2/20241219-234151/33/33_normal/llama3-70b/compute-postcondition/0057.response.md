The statement `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console but does not change the values of any variables. The conditions given earlier about `curr_lat` and `dir` are not directly affected by this print statement, nor does this statement alter `n`, `t`, or `dir`.

Since no variables are updated, and it merely prints to the output, we retain the previous state information unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input.**
