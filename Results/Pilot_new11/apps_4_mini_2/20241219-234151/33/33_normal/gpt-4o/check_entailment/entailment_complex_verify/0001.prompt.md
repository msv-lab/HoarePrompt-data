You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
    if position != 0:
        valid = False
    if valid:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze each part of the program based on the problem description and the rules set forth for Limak's journey.

1. **Initial Setup**: The variable `position` is initialized to `0`, representing the North Pole. The journey starts there, which is appropriate.

2. **Movement Logic**:
   - When moving "North", the program checks if `position - t < 0` to ensure Limak does not exceed the North Pole. If true, it sets `valid` to `False`.
   - When moving "South", it checks if `position + t > 20000` to ensure Limak does not exceed the South Pole. If true, it sets `valid` to `False`.
   - For "West" or "East", it checks if the `position` is `0` (North Pole) or `20000` (South Pole). If Limak is at either pole and tries to move west or east, `valid` is set to `False`.
   - If `position` ever becomes less than `0` or greater than `20000`, it sets `valid` to `False`.

3. **Final Position Check**: After all movements are processed, it checks if the final position (`position`) equals `0` (indicating Limak ends back at the North Pole). If not, it sets `valid` to `False`.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if all conditions are met by setting `valid` to `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Case

However, let's consider a special scenario where Limak tries to make a sequence of moves that results in him being at the North Pole, and then attempts to move inappropriately. 

For example:
```
Input
3
20000 South
1000 East
20000 North
```
Here's what happens step by step:
1. Move 20000 South: valid, `position` becomes 20000 (South Pole).
2. Move 1000 East: since `position` is 20000 (South Pole and no East/West movement is allowed), `valid` should become `False`, but according to the program, `valid` will remain `True`.
3. Move 20000 North: invalid because Limak has already moved East while at the South Pole.

With this input, the final output is "NO" as expected, but the internal logic fails to correctly flag the movement "East" at the South Pole, so it does not invalidate the journey.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the rules when moving East or West at the poles specifically, failing to maintain the journey validity in some scenarios.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; each t_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6 and dir_i is a string that is either "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `position` is the final position after all steps, `valid` indicates if the moves were all within permitted limits, `n` remains the initial input integer between 1 and 50, `t_i` and `dir_i` are the inputs received during the iterations, and if any invalidation conditions were met, `valid` will be `False`.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`position` is the final position after all steps and is not equal to 0, `valid` is False, `n` remains the initial input integer between 1 and 50, and `t_i` and `dir_i` are the inputs received during the iterations.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`position` is the final position after all steps and is not equal to 0, `n` remains the initial input integer between 1 and 50, and `t_i` and `dir_i` are the inputs received during the iterations. If `valid` is True, 'YES' is printed. If `valid` is False, no 'YES' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of directional movements based on user input and checks if the movements are valid according to specific constraints. It does not accept parameters, and it takes an integer input `n` (the number of movements) followed by `n` lines of input containing an integer `t` (the distance) and a string `dir` (the direction). The function maintains a `position` variable that reflects the user's current position, initialized to 0, and a boolean `valid` to track the validity of the movements. If any movement attempts to go below 0 or above 20000, or if specific direction constraints are violated (e.g., attempting to move 'West' or 'East' when at the limits), the `valid` flag is set to False. Following all movements, the function evaluates whether the final position is 0, and if all movements were valid. If `valid` is True and the final position is 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function may miss a check to invalidate movements to 'West' or 'East' by not updating the `valid` flag accordingly after those direction attempts, leading to potential unforeseen outcomes. Overall, it evaluates the movement logic within the constraints of the problem and provides a simple verification based on these rules.
