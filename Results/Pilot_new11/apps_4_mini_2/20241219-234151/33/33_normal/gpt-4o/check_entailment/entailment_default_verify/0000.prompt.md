You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
    if position != 0:
        valid = False
    if valid:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the logic implemented in the code.

### Conditions from the problem description:
1. If Limak is at the North Pole (position 0), he can only move South.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole (position 20000), he can only move North.
3. The journey must end at the North Pole (position 0).

### Analysis of the program:
- The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of parts Limak's journey consists of.
- A variable `position` is initialized to 0 (indicating the North Pole).
- For each journey segment:
  - The distance `t` and the direction `dir` are read.
  - If the direction is "North":
    - It checks if moving North would take the position below 0. If it would, it's deemed invalid.
    - It decreases the `position` by `t`.
  - If the direction is "South":
    - It checks if moving South would take the position above 20000. If it would, it's deemed invalid.
    - It increases the `position` by `t`.
  - If the direction is either "West" or "East":
    - It checks if Limak is at the North or South Pole. If he is, it's invalid.
- After processing all segments, it checks if the final `position` is 0 (North Pole).

### Potential issues:
- The condition for moving "North" only checks if the resulting position is less than 0, but does not fully account for the first move staying at the North Pole and then immediately moving "East" or "West" (which should be invalid).
- The program allows moving East or West while Limak is at the North Pole (position = 0) or South Pole (position = 20000) without properly preventing it as per condition 1 and 2.
- Additionally, when checking the movement to the South, it fails to prevent moving South too much (i.e., going above position 20000) in the condition when initial position is already near its limit. 

Let's consider a specific input case that reveals a problem in the code:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1000 East
  ```
  In this case, Limak who starts at the North Pole (position 0) attempts to move East, which violates condition 1, yet the program does not recognize this as invalid.

Another example, which is similar to existing cases:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  20000 South
  10 East
  20000 North
  ```
In this case, Limak moves to the South Pole (position 20000), then tries to go East which should be invalid, but the program does not catch it.

### Conclusion:
Since the program can fail for inputs that violate the movement restrictions described, the program does not adhere correctly to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a series of directional movements based on user input and checks if the movements are valid according to specific constraints. It does not accept parameters, and it takes an integer input `n` (the number of movements) followed by `n` lines of input containing an integer `t` (the distance) and a string `dir` (the direction). The function maintains a `position` variable that reflects the user's current position, initialized to 0, and a boolean `valid` to track the validity of the movements. If any movement attempts to go below 0 or above 20000, or if specific direction constraints are violated (e.g., attempting to move 'West' or 'East' when at the limits), the `valid` flag is set to False. Following all movements, the function evaluates whether the final position is 0, and if all movements were valid. If `valid` is True and the final position is 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function may miss a check to invalidate movements to 'West' or 'East' by not updating the `valid` flag accordingly after those direction attempts, leading to potential unforeseen outcomes. Overall, it evaluates the movement logic within the constraints of the problem and provides a simple verification based on these rules.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
