According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates `j` from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, which means `j` will take values starting from `i + 1` up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
