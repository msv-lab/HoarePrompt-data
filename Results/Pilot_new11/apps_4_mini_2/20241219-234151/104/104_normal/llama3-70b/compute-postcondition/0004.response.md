According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, which means that `j` must start from `1` and can go up to `n`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to `1` and `i` is `0`, the initial value of `j` will be `1`, allowing the loop to execute properly.

After the first iteration, the value of `j` will increment, but at the start, it aligns correctly. The other variables `max_erase` and `i` do not affect the execution of this loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
