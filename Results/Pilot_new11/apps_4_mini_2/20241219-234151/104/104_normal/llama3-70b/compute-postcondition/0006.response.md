The code updates the value of `max_erase` to the maximum of its current value and the calculated value `j - i - 1`. Given that `max_erase` starts at 0, and `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, we can compute `j - i - 1` as follows:

1. `j = 1`
2. `i = 0`
3. Therefore, `j - i - 1 = 1 - 0 - 1 = 0`.

Next, we evaluate `max(max_erase, j - i - 1)`:
- The current value of `max_erase` is `0`.
- The calculated value is also `0`.

Thus, `max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` results in `0`, so `max_erase` remains unchanged. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**.
