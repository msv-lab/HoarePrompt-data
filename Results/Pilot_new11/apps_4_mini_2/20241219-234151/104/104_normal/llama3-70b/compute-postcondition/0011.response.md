According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `n` must be at least 3 to continue allowing the loop to iterate. 

State: **`max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
