According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. The range for `j` in the for loop starts from `i + 1`, which is `2`, and goes up to `n + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, moving from `2` to `3`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since we need `j` to be `3` to execute the loop again, the condition implies that `n` must be at least `3` to allow the next iteration, making the total maximum value of `j` now `3`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_erase` and 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `n` must be at least 3.**
