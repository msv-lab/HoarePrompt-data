Postcondition: ***`max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for valid values of `j`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 3 at the start of the loop. All elements in the list `a` from index `i` (2) to index `j` (3) are consecutive and the difference between each element `a[k]` and `a[i]` is equal to `k - i`, indicating that `a[2]` equals `a[2]`, and `a[3]` equals `a[2] + 1`.***
