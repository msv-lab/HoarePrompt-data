The code `print(max_erase)` will output the current value of `max_erase` without changing its value. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000; `max_erase` is unchanged; `i` is `n - 1`.**
