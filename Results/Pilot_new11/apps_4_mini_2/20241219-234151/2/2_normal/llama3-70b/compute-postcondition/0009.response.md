According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `i` and `x` variables. The loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to and including `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2. 

Furthermore, for the loop to continue executing, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2 (because `i` would need to be less than or equal to `x`). 

Therefore, the updated state should reflect these adjustments: 
- `max_sum` remains 0 
- `max_num` remains 0
- `i` is now 2 
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `digit_sum` retains its value since it isn't updated as it doesn't affect the continuation of the loop.

State: **`max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `digit_sum` is 1**
