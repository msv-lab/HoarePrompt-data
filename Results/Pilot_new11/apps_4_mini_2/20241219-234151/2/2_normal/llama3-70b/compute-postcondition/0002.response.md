`max_num` is assigned the value 0. The value of `max_sum` remains unchanged at 0, and `x` is still an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0; `max_num` is 0.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0; `max_num` is 0**.
