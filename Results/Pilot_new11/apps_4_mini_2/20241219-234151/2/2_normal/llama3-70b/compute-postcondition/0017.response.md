`max_num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. Therefore, after the code execution, `max_num` becomes 3. The other variables (`max_sum`, `i`, `x`, and `digit_sum`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 3, `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `digit_sum` is 3.**
