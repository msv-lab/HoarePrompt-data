The code assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. Given the initial state, `max_sum` was 0 and `digit_sum` is 1 and is greater than `max_sum`. Therefore, after executing the code, `max_sum` is updated to 1. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
