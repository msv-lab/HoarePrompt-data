The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state indicates that `x` is an input integer ranging from `1` to `10^18`, but the execution of the code does not alter the value of `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_sum` is now `0`, with no other variables affected. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18; `max_sum` is 0**
