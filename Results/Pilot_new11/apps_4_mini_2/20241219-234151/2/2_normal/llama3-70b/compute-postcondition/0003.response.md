According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. For the loop to run, `x` must be at least 1, as the range is defined from 1 to `x + 1`. The given states of `max_sum` and `max_num` do not affect the execution of the loop.

Since `x` is already guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^18, and the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 to `x`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- `x` is already within the valid range and does not need adjustment.
- Initially, `i` must be set to 1 at the beginning of the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1**
