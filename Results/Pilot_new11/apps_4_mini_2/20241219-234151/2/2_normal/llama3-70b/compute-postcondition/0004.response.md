The `digit_sum` variable is assigned the sum of the digits of `i`, which is currently 1. When `i` is converted to a string and iterated over, the only digit is '1'. Converting '1' back to an integer gives the sum of 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
