The code assigns the value of `digit_sum` to `max_sum`. Previously, `max_sum` was 0, and `digit_sum` is given as 2. Therefore, after execution, `max_sum` will be updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `digit_sum` is 2**
