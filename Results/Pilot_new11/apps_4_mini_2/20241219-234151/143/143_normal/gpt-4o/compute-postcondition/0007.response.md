According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < `n` ≤ 30. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `i` will be 2. Since `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 < `n` ≤ 30, `i` is 2, `dp[1]` is updated to min(`dp[1]`, `c[1]`)**
