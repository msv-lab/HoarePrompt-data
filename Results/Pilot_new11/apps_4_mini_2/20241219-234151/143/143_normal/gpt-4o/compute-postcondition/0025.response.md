According to the code, the loop will execute while `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Since the loop starts with `i` at 30, the next iteration will decrease `i` by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 30. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to 29.

The variables `n`, `dp`, `answer`, and `current_cost` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop's iteration control. 

Thus, we update `i` to 29 while keeping the rest of the states intact.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[30]`, `current_cost` is unchanged, `i` is 29, and `L` is decreased by \(2^{30}\)**.
