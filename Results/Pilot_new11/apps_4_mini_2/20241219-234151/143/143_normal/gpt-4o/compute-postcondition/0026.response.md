The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i]`, where `i` is 29. The other variables remain unchanged in their state. As a result, `current_cost` is modified, but since we do not have the exact values of `dp[29]`, we cannot express the updated `current_cost` numerically. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, `answer` is the minimum of its previous value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[30]`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[29]`, `i` is 29, and `L` is decreased by \(2^{30}\).
