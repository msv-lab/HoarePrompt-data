The `current_cost` increases by the value of `dp[i]`, where `i` is 28. The initial state reflects that `dp[i]` has been initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, so `dp[28]` has an assigned value, but we do not know what it specifically is. Therefore, after execution, the state of `current_cost` will be changed.

However, all other variables `n`, `dp`, `answer`, and `L`, as well as the logic about the potential decrement of `L`, remain untouched by the current line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30; `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30; current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + dp[28]`; `i` is 28; `answer` is updated to min(previous_answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[29])**.
