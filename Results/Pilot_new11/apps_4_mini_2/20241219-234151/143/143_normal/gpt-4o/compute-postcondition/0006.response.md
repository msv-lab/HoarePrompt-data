The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `c[i]`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so `dp[1]` is being updated. The specific values of `dp[1]` and `c[1]` are unknown, but the operation will yield a new value for `dp[1]` that is the lesser of the two. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < `n` â‰¤ 30, `i` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated to min(`dp[1]`, `c[1]`)**
