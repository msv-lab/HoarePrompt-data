In the provided code, the list `c` is being constructed by concatenating the `costs` list with additional elements. The original length of `costs` is `n`, which is known to be between 1 and 30. The new list `c` will always have a fixed length of 31.

1. The elements of `c` will be the same as those in the `costs` list for the first `n` elements.
2. The remaining elements in `c` (from index `n` to index 30) will be filled with the value of `max_cost`, which is \(10^{18}\). This will fill the remaining 31 - n spaces in the list.

Since `costs` has `n` integers, after this assignment, `c` will have:
- The first `n` elements filled with values from `costs`, and
- The remaining `31 - n` elements filled with \(10^{18}\).

The original values of other variables (`n`, `L`, `max_cost`, `dp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `c` and the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer c_i (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9); `max_cost` is 10^18; `dp` is a list of 31 integers all equal to 10^18; `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` integers are from `costs` and the last `31 - n` integers are equal to 10^18.**
