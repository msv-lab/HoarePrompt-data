The code modifies the value of `L`. Specifically, `L` is decremented by `1 << i`, which is equal to `2^i`. Since `i` is 30, `1 << i` calculates as `1 << 30`, which is `2^30`. Hence, `L` will be reduced by `2^30`. The states of the other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `dp[i]` is initialized for `1 ≤ i ≤ 30`, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[30]`, `i` is 30, and `L` is now equal to `L - 2^30`.**
