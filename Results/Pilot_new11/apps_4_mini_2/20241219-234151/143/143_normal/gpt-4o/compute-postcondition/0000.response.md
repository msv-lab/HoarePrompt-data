The variable `max_cost` is assigned a value of \(10^{18}\). The initial state of other variables (`n`, `L`, and `costs`) remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer c_i (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `max_cost` is 10^18.**
