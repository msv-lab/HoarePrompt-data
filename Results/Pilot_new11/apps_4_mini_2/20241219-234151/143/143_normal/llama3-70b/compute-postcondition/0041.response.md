`vol` is assigned the value of \(2^j - 1\). The value of `j` is 1, so calculating \(2^1 - 1\) gives us \(1\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1**
