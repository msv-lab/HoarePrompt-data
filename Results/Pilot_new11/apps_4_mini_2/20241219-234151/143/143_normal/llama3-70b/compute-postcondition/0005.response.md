According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given as an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, it guarantees that `n` is at least 1, which allows the loop to execute for at least one iteration. The variable `i` is initialized to 1, which is suitable for the loop execution in this context. 

The states provided appear to already accommodate the necessary preconditions for the loop to execute properly. Given that `j` will start from 0 and increment until it is less than `n`, there isn’t a need for modifications. 

State: **`n` is any integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `dp` is a list of integers with `L + 1` elements, dp[0] is 0, other elements are float('inf'), and `i` is 1**
