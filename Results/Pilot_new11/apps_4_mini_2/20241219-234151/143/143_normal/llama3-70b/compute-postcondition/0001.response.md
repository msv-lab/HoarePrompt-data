The variable `costs` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping integer conversion over input split by spaces. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and the costs list `c` remains unchanged. However, the execution of the code updates or creates a new variable:

- The variable `costs` now holds a list of integers that are input by the user.

Other variables (`n`, `L`, and `c`) remain unchanged in terms of their assigned or scoped values. Hence, the Output State will reflect the assignment of `costs`.

Output State: **`n` is now an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 30; `L` is now an input integer within the range 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9; `costs` is now a list of integers from input.**
