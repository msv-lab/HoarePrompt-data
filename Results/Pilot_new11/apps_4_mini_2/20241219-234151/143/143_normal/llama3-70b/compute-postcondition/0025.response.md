According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to be executed again, `j` must be 1, and `n` remains as the previous value within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `j` is 1**
