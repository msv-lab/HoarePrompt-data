The initial state specifies that `n` is within the range of 1 to 30, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1. The code involves an assignment to an element of the list `dp`, where the new value for `dp[i]` is the minimum between its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`.

The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be relevant for indexing. Assuming `i` is in the range where `dp` can be accessed (1 to 30 for `n`), the value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the current value of `dp[i]`, `dp[i - vol]`, and `costs[j]`. 

Since `vol` is 1, this means we are looking at `dp[i - 1]`. So the expression becomes `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[1])`.

The output state will reflect that `dp[i]` may change based on the minimum value calculated but does not specify the internal state of `dp[i]`, `dp[i - 1]`, or `costs[1]`. 

Therefore, the output state retains the valid boundaries for `n` and the value of `j` while indicating how `dp[i]` might be updated. Since we don't have the initial values of `dp` or `costs`, we keep the information general.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, and `dp[i]` may be updated to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.**
