Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and (`dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`) provided that `vol` is less than or equal to `i`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `vol` are set to `L + 1`, 0, and their current value respectively.***
