`vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is initially `0`, we calculate `vol` as follows: `2 ** 0 - 1`, which equals `0`. The state of `n` and `j` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the calculation. 

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0**.
