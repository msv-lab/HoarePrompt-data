Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `dp[0]` is equal to 0, and other elements of `dp` remain initialized to float('inf'). If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` may equal min(dp[i], dp[i - 2] + costs[n]) for a valid index `i` where i ≥ 2.***
