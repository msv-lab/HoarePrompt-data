You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 12
20 30 70 90

Output
150

Input
4 3
10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input
4 3
10 100 1000 10000

Output
30

Input
5 787787787
123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and analyze the program logic.

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade, given `n` types of bottles with specific volumes and costs. Each type `i` bottle has a volume of `2^i - 1` liters.

The program implements a dynamic programming solution where:
- It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to purchase exactly `i` liters of lemonade.
- It iterates through possible volumes up to `L`, and for each volume, it checks all bottle types to see if it can produce that volume by using one of the bottle types and the previously computed minimum costs.

### Analyzing the Code for Potential Issues:

1. **Volume Calculation**: 
   The volume for bottle type `j` is calculated as `2 ** j - 1`. However, when `j` is `0`, this correctly gives `1 liter`. Subsequent volumes are `3`, `7`, `15`, `31`, ..., up to `2^(n) - 1`. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: 
   The initialization of `dp[0] = 0` is appropriate since no cost is incurred for 0 liters. The loop that updates `dp` for all volumes up to `L` also seems right at first glance, but we need to consider if it fully captures the requirements mentioned in the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   One potential edge case undervalued by the current implementation arises when `L` is very small (like `1 liter`) but costs are disproportionately high, or when `L` is strictly less than the smallest volume available. In both cases, while the program is designed to find the minimum cost for `exactly L liters`, it may fail to assess if larger volumes can somehow be advantageous due to lower costs.

### Testing an Edge Case:
- If we feed it an input such as:
  ```
  1 1
  100
  ```
  The only available bottle gives `2^0 - 1 = 1 liter` for a cost of `100 roubles`. It returns `100`, which is correct.

However, consider:
- Input:
  ```
  2 1
  10 5
  ```
  In this case, for `L = 1`, it can only utilize the first bottle which is `10 roubles`. It might seem okay for this scenario, but what if it gets:
  
- Input:
  ```
  2 3
  50 20
  ```
  This output would be `50`, but if we assess using `1 liter` from both bottles, it would simply be `40`, which is lower overall.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis:
- The program logic does not handle cases where utilizing lower volumes in combination could yield higher efficiencies in achieving at least `L` with lower costs.
- The program consists of missed logical considerations into overall costing strategies when using the available bottle options effectively.

Therefore, given these points:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and the costs list c contains n integers where each c[i] is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[i]` is the minimum of all possible sums of `dp[i - (2^j - 1)] + costs[j]` for `vol` such that `vol ≤ L` and `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`; other `dp` elements remain float('inf') if not updated.
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
