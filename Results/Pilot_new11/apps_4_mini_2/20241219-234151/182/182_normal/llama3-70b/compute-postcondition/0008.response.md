Functionality: ** The function reads an integer input representing a rotation angle of a camera in degrees, normalizes this angle to the range of 0 to 359 degrees using the modulo operation, and then evaluates the normalized angle. If the normalized angle is 0, it prints 0. For any other normalized angle, it calculates and prints an integer representing the adjusted rotation state based on the normalized angle, specifically the division of the angle adjusted by 90 degrees and then taken modulo 4. The function does not return any value; it only prints results to the output. The potential edge cases include handling of inputs that might initially exceed the expected bounds, and the function solely relies on computed standard inputs without validation of range constraints on the input itself. **
