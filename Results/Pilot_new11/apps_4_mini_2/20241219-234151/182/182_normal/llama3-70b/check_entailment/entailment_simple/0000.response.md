To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's break down the logic.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We are given a rotation angle \( x \) that can vary between \(-10^{18}\) and \(10^{18}\).
2. The task is to determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise rotations required to align a rotated image such that it is minimally deviated from the vertical.
3. The outputs should handle any angle and reduce it correctly using the modulo operation.

### Code Analysis:
The program workflow is as follows:
1. It reads an angle \( x \) from input, representing the rotation angle of the camera.
2. It computes \( x \) modulo 360 to normalize the angle into a 0-359 degree range:
   - This step ensures that no matter how high or low \( x \) is, we can work with the equivalent angle within a full circle.
3. It checks if the normalized angle \( x \) is zero:
   - If \( x \) is zero, it prints `0`, meaning no rotations are needed.
4. If \( x \) is not zero, it calculates the minimum number of 90-degree rotations:
   - The formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is used to determine the number of 90-degree clockwise turns necessary to get the angle back to minimal deviation from the vertical. This works by effectively rounding up after adding 90 and then finding the remainder when divided by 4, which gives the count of 90-degree turns required.

### Evaluation of the Implementation:
1. The modulo operation with 360 effectively handles the large range of \( x \) and brings it within manageable bounds for computation.
2. The behavior for \( x = 0 \) is correct, as it results in no required rotations.
3. The formula for the number of turns ensures that the output satisfies the criteria for any positive or negative value of \( x \):
   - For negative angles, adding 90 before division successfully adjusts the behavior to count the necessary clockwise turns accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description correctly, as it calculates the minimum number of 90 degree rotations necessary for any given rotation angle. Thus, it successfully adheres to all provided specifications without failing for any edge cases, making it reliable and accurate in its output.
