To analyze the provided program against the given problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The input is an integer `x`, representing the rotation angle in degrees. Positive values denote clockwise rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation.
2. The output should be the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to bring the image deviation from vertical to a minimum.
3. The possible deviations from vertical can be obtained as:
   - For positive `x`, the rotations are straightforward.
   - For negative `x`, the effective rotation can be computed after converting it to its clockwise equivalent by adding 360 degrees as needed.

### Implemented Code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if x == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer angle and computes its equivalent within the range of [0, 360) using the modulo operation. This part is correct for defining the position of the rotation within a circle.
2. The case where `x` is exactly `0` correctly returns `0` with no further computation needed.
3. For non-zero values of `x`, the program computes `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This logic aims to determine how many 90-degree clockwise turns are needed.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Counter-Clockwise Input**: For negative angles, the logic does not correctly convert the angle into a form suitable for determining the necessary clockwise rotations.
   - For example, for an input of `-60`, the modulo operation yields `300`. Using the current formula would give `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which evaluates to `4`. However, based on the provided problem description, the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns should actually be `3` for `-60`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly compute the number of 90-degree turns needed for negative angles. 

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
For an input of `-60`, the program outputs `4` instead of the correct answer `3`, which clearly shows that it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Hence, it is deemed incorrect.
