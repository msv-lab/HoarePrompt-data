You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.

One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?

But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.

Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.

Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to "true up". [Image] 

The next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.


-----Examples-----
Input
60

Output
1

Input
-60

Output
3



-----Note-----

When the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.

From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if x == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program against the given problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The input is an integer `x`, representing the rotation angle in degrees. Positive values denote clockwise rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation.
2. The output should be the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to bring the image deviation from vertical to a minimum.
3. The possible deviations from vertical can be obtained as:
   - For positive `x`, the rotations are straightforward.
   - For negative `x`, the effective rotation can be computed after converting it to its clockwise equivalent by adding 360 degrees as needed.

### Implemented Code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if x == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer angle and computes its equivalent within the range of [0, 360) using the modulo operation. This part is correct for defining the position of the rotation within a circle.
2. The case where `x` is exactly `0` correctly returns `0` with no further computation needed.
3. For non-zero values of `x`, the program computes `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This logic aims to determine how many 90-degree clockwise turns are needed.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Counter-Clockwise Input**: For negative angles, the logic does not correctly convert the angle into a form suitable for determining the necessary clockwise rotations.
   - For example, for an input of `-60`, the modulo operation yields `300`. Using the current formula would give `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`, which evaluates to `4`. However, based on the provided problem description, the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns should actually be `3` for `-60`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly compute the number of 90-degree turns needed for negative angles. 

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
For an input of `-60`, the program outputs `4` instead of the correct answer `3`, which clearly shows that it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Hence, it is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer input representing a rotation angle of a camera in degrees, normalizes this angle to the range of 0 to 359 degrees using the modulo operation, and then evaluates the normalized angle. If the normalized angle is 0, it prints 0. For any other normalized angle, it calculates and prints an integer representing the adjusted rotation state based on the normalized angle, specifically the division of the angle adjusted by 90 degrees and then taken modulo 4. The function does not return any value; it only prints results to the output. The potential edge cases include handling of inputs that might initially exceed the expected bounds, and the function solely relies on computed standard inputs without validation of range constraints on the input itself.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
