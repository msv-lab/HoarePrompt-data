The value of `current_sum` is assigned 0, which means it has been reset to a new value. The previous value of `current_sum` was equal to the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `segment_length` remains 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of `ticket`, `i` is 1.
