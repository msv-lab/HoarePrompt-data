The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The initial value of `current_sum` was equal to `int(ticket[2])`, but after the execution of the code, `current_sum` has been changed to `0`. All other variables retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `segment_length` remains 2, `i` is 2**
