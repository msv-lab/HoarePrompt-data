According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100, the loop can execute provided that `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` remains 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is reset to 0, `segment_count` is increased to 1, `i` is 1**
