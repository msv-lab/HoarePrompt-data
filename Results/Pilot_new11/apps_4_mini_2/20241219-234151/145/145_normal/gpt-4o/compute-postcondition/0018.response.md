The statement `segment_count += 1` increments the `segment_count` by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` was 2, so the new value becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ticket` is a string of exactly `n` digits, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 3, `i` is 2**.
