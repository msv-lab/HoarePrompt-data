You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function based on the problem description.

The program's goal is to check if a ticket (represented as a sequence of digits) can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. 

The `func_1` function first iterates through possible segment lengths, calculates the target sum for the segment, and then tries to partition the ticket into segments with that target sum. 

### Potential Issues with the Program:

1. **Target Sum Calculation**: The program calculates `target_sum` based on the first segment of a given length. However, it does not ensure that subsequent segments can also match that target sum while considering the entire ticket correctly. It only checks from the beginning, which might not represent potential valid segmentations.
  
2. **Segment Count Condition**: The program checks if `current_sum` is zero and `segment_count > 1` to decide if it has successfully found two or more segments with the same sum. However, it would return 'NO' prematurely if no valid partition is found for the current segment length without considering other possibilities.

### Test Case:

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the potential failure of the program:

- Input:
```
n = 6
ticket = "231231"
```

In this case, the ticket can be partitioned as follows:
- Segment 1: `2 + 3` (sum = 5)
- Segment 2: `1 + 2 + 3` (sum = 5)

So, `2 + 3` can equal `1 + 2 + 3` if segmented correctly. 

However, the current program logic will not find this configuration correctly given how it derives the `target_sum` and proceeds only left to right without trying all configurations.

### Conclusion:

Since we have found an example where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one case, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `segment_sum` takes two integer parameters, `start` and `end`, and computes the sum of the digits in a string variable `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. It assumes that `ticket` is a string containing n digits, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and that both indices `start` and `end` are valid according to the constraints 0 ≤ start ≤ end < n. After executing, the function returns this computed sum. Note that the function does not check if `ticket` meets the specified constraints or if `start` and `end` are within the valid range, which may lead to potential errors if the assumptions are violated.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
