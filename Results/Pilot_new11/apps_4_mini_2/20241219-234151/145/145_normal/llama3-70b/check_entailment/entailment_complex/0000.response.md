To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the implementations given in the code.

### Problem Overview:
The function must determine if a ticket composed of `n` digits is "lucky." A ticket is considered lucky if it can be split into two or more non-overlapping segments where the sum of the digits in each segment is equal.

**Requirements:**
1. The input consists of:
   - An integer `n` (number of digits).
   - A sequence of `n` digits.
2. The output should return "YES" if the ticket is lucky, and "NO" otherwise.

### Code Analysis:
1. The input is read correctly from standard input, and the digits are converted to a list of integers.
2. The `func_1(ticket)` function is meant to check if the ticket can be split as required.
3. The algorithm calculates the total sum of digits and checks if it is odd. If it is odd, the ticket cannot be split into two equal sums (as the halves wouldn't be integers), and it returns `False`.
4. If the total is even, it computes `target_sum` as half of `total_sum`.
5. It then iterates through the digits to accumulate sums into segments. Each time the accumulated sum equals `target_sum`, it resets to start a new segment and increments a counter.
6. Finally, it checks if at least two segments were found (i.e., `segments >= 2`) and returns `True` if so.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The function correctly verifies if a list of digits can be divided into segments that are equal to half the sum.
- If the total sum is odd, it correctly identifies that segmentation is impossible.
- It returns "YES" and "NO" based on whether it found at least 2 valid segments during its iteration.
- The edge case of forming segments is well-handled by resetting `curr_sum` once a valid segment is identified.
- Given the constraints, this logic will suffice for all possible valid inputs as stated.

### Conclusion:
The code adheres to the problem's requirements by accurately evaluating whether it can partition the digit sequence into lucky segments. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
