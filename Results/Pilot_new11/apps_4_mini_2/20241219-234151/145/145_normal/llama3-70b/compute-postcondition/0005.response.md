The variable `curr_sum` is initialized to 0. There are no other affected variables, and the previous conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `curr_sum` while maintaining the initial definitions of the other variables.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with a length `n` (where `2 <= n <= 100`), each digit between `0` and `9`; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2; `curr_sum` is 0**.
