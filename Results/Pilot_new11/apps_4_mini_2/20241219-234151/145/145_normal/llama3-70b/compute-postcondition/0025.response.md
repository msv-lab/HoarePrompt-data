The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `ticket`. `ticket` is a string composed of digits with a length between 2 and 100, and each digit is in the range of 0 to 9. After executing the function body, if the total sum of the digits in `ticket` is odd, the function returns `False`. If the total sum is even, the function checks the number of segments in `ticket` that have a sum of digits equal to 'target_sum'; if there are 2 or more such segments, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string of digits `ticket` and determine if the total sum of the digits is odd, or if even, check if there are at least two segments with a specific sum. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string of digits `ticket` and returns `False` if the sum of the digits is odd; if the sum is even, it returns `True` if there are at least two segments with a specified sum, otherwise it returns `False`.**
