After executing the code `curr_sum = 0`, the variable `curr_sum` is updated to 0. The other variables remain unaffected. The previous value of `curr_sum` was `target_sum`, but now it has been explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1 plus its previous value.**
