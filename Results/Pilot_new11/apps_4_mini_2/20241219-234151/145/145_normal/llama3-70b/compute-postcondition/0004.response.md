In the provided code, `target_sum` is assigned the value of `total_sum // 2`, which means `target_sum` will be equal to half of `total_sum`. Since `total_sum` is given to be an even number, `target_sum` will also be an integer.

The other variables (`ticket` and `total_sum`) remain unaffected by this code snippet. 

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with a length `n`, where `2 <= n <= 100`, and each digit is between `0` and `9`; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, and `total_sum` is an even number; `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`.**
