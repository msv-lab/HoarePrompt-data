Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, and if `curr_sum` is equal to `target_sum`, then `segments` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `curr_sum` remains unchanged and `segments` stays the same.***
