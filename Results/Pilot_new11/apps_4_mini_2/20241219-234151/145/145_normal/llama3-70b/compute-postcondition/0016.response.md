`curr_sum` is assigned the value `0`. There are no changes to the other variables: `ticket` remains a string of digits, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2`, and `segments` is updated to `segments + 1` before the current code execution. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 100, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is an even number, `target_sum` is equal to `total_sum // 2, segments` is updated to `segments + 1`, `curr_sum` is 0**.
