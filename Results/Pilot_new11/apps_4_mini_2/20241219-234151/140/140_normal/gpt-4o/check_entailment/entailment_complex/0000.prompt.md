You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of directed edges in the graph (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (u, v) representing a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing `m` directed edges, `graph` is a defaultdict where each vertex `u` has a list that includes all vertices `v` that it points to, representing the directed edges.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES', indicating that the directed graph represented by the edges has been validated and confirmed to be acyclic.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer representing the number of directed edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing `m` directed edges, `graph` is a defaultdict where each vertex `u` has a list that includes all vertices `v` that it points to. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples containing `m` directed edges, and `graph` still contains all the edges as it initially did, preserving at least one cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating a specific condition based on the graph structure, which still contains all the directed edges and preserves at least one cycle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a directed graph, an integer `m` representing the number of directed edges, and a list `edges` of tuples where each tuple (u, v) indicates a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v. The function constructs a graph using these edges and checks for cycles in the graph.

Initially, if the graph is found to be acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If a cycle is detected, the function attempts to remove each edge (u, v) and checks if the graph still remains acyclic after the removal. If it finds that removing any edge allows the graph to be acyclic, it will return 'YES'. 

If all edges are checked and none allow the graph to be acyclic after their removal, the function returns 'NO', indicating that the graph contains cycles. 

Thus, the final state indicates whether the directed graph is acyclic after considering the possibility of removing one directed edge, and the program will always return either 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions. It should also be noted that the function does not handle the case where the edges list is empty nor validate the input parameters for proper ranges explicitly, which could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid input is provided.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (from 1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing directed edges to other vertices; n is an integer representing the number of vertices such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree` is a dictionary where each value represents the total number of incoming edges to each vertex from the graph, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys, and each key `u` has its outgoing edges counted towards the in-degrees of its endpoints.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `count` is equal to the number of nodes processed from the original queue, `in_degree` is a dictionary reflecting the final in-degrees of all nodes in the graph, where the nodes with in-degree 0 have all been processed, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 500, `graph` continues to hold its structure with `n` keys, representing the nodes and their neighbors.
    return count != n
    #The program returns whether the number of nodes processed from the original queue is not equal to the integer n, which is between 2 and 500.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_cycle` takes a directed graph represented as a dictionary of vertices and their outgoing edges, and checks for the presence of cycles within that graph. It computes the in-degrees of each vertex, processes vertices with an in-degree of zero, and counts how many vertices are reachable from the starting points. If the count of processed vertices is not equal to the total number of vertices `n`, it indicates the presence of a cycle in the graph. The function returns `True` if there is a cycle (i.e., the number of processed vertices is less than `n`), and `False` otherwise. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the graph is empty, disconnected, or contains self-loops, which could affect the in-degree calculations and overall cycle detection.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
