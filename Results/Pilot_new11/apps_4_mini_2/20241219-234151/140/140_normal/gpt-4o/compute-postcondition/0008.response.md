Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least one key, `n` is between 2 and 500, `u` is the first key in the graph, `in_degree` is a dictionary where for each value `v` in `graph[u]`, `in_degree[v]` has been incremented by 1 for each element in `graph[u]` (the total increment equals the number of elements in `graph[u]`).**
