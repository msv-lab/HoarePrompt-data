Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary with values reflecting the in-degrees of all neighbors after decrementing for all neighbors of the node; `n` is an integer between 2 and 500; `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys; `queue` contains all neighbors of the processed node that have an in-degree of 0 after decrementing; `node` is a valid key in the graph, and `graph[node]` was processed for all its neighbors.**
