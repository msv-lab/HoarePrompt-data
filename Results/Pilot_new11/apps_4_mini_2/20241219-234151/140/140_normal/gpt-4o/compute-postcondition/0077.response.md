Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` maintains its structure with `n` keys; if `in_degree[neighbor]` is equal to 0, then `queue` includes `neighbor`, `node` still has at least 1 remaining neighbor in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, and `in_degree[next_neighbor]` is equal to 0.***
