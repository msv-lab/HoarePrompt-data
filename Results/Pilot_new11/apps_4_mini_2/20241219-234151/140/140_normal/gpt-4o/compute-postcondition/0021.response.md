The variable `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1. Given the preconditions, `in_degree[v]` was previously some integer value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, `n` is between 2 and 500, `u` is the third key in the graph, `graph[u]` has at least 2 elements, and `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1.**
