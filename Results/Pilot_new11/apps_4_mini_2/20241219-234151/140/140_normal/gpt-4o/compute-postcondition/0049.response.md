`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The variable `neighbor` must be a neighbor of `node`, and since `node` has at least one neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` will definitely change. The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` depends on its previous value, but overall the states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`in_degree` must have at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; `queue` contains one less element; `node` is the element that was removed from `queue`; `count` is increased by 1; `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1.**
