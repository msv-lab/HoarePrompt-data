Postcondition: ***`in_degree` is updated with `in_degree[neighbor]` decreased by 1, `n` is between 2 and 500, `graph` maintains its structure with `n` keys, `queue` is updated to include `neighbor`, `node` is the current node which has at least 1 neighbor in `graph`, `count` is increased by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0, indicating that `neighbor` has no remaining incoming edges.***
