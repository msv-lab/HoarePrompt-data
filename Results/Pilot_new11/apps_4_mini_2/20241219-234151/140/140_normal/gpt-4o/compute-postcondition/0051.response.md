The operation `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The initial state mentions that `in_degree` must have at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0, and since the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is also 0, it implies that `neighbor` can be added to the `queue`. The values of `n`, `graph`, and the condition of `count` being increased by 1 remain unaffected by this particular operation. 

The `queue` now contains the `neighbor`, so we need to update this state as well.

Output State: **`in_degree` must have at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; `queue` now contains `neighbor` added; `node` is the element that was removed from `queue`; `count` is increased by 1; the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.**
