The variable `count` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`in_degree`, `n`, `graph`, and `queue`) remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree` is a dictionary with values representing incoming edges, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys, `queue` is a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`, and `count` is now `0`.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary with values representing incoming edges, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `graph` is a dictionary with `n` keys, `queue` is a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`, and `count` is `0`.**
