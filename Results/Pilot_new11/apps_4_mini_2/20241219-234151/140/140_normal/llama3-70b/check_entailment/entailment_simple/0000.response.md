The provided program verifies whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. Let's analyze the problem description and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input Format**: 
   - The first line gives the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`.
   - The next `m` lines describe directed edges in the graph.
   
2. **Output Requirement**: 
   - The program should print "YES" if it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, otherwise "NO".
   
3. **Cycle Definition**: 
   - A directed graph is acyclic if it contains no cycles.

### Program Analysis
1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - The graph is represented as an adjacency list where `graph[u]` contains all vertices that can be reached directly from vertex `u`.
   
2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program uses depth-first search (DFS) through the function `func_1` to detect cycles in the graph. The `visited` list keeps track of explored nodes, while the `rec_stack` keeps track of nodes currently in the recursion stack. If a node is found in the recursion stack while being processed, a cycle exists.
   
3. **Decision Logic**:
   - After performing the cycle detection on all nodes, if a cycle is found, it prints "NO". If no cycles are detected, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Evaluation
- The program determines if there exists a cycle or not. However, it does not consider the condition of potentially removing an edge to make the graph acyclic. The program only checks if the graph is already acyclic or if it has cycles without examining whether removing just one edge can resolve the cycle.
- For example, in cases where multiple edges create cycles, the program will output "NO" unconditionally without checking if at least one edge can be removed to resolve the cycle.

### Counterexample
- Consider a graph where vertices form a single cycle and have two directed edges linking back (e.g., edges (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 2)).
- The correct output should be "YES" because removing any one edge (say, (1, 2)) will result in an acyclic graph. However, the program will fail to identify this situation correctly.

### Final Conclusion
The annotated program does not fulfill the requirement of checking if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

Correctness: **False**
