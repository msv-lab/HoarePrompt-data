The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: 
- `node`: an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph`: a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing directed edges from the corresponding vertex.
- `visited`: a list of booleans indicating if a vertex has been visited.
- `rec_stack`: a list of booleans indicating if a vertex is part of the current recursion stack. 

After executing the function body, it can return multiple values based on various conditions:
- In Case_1, the function returns `True`.
- In Case_2, it returns `True`, indicating a cycle is detected in the graph at the node since its neighbor has already been visited.
- In Case_3, the function returns `True`.
- In Case_4, it returns `True`, indicating successful traversal or processing of the node, which is an integer having at least 2 neighbors in the graph.
- In Case_5, it returns `True`, indicating that the current node has been successfully visited and processed in the graph traversal.
- In Case_6, it returns `True`, indicating that the current node is part of a cycle in the graph, as it is marked as visited and has multiple neighbors to explore.
- In Case_7, it returns `False`, indicating that no cycle is detected in the neighbors of the node in the graph.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a vertex represented by an integer `node`, a graph structure represented by a list of lists, and additional parameters for tracking visited vertices and the recursion stack, while detecting cycles and indicating the processing status of the current vertex. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters node, graph, visited, and rec_stack, and it returns values that indicate successful traversal, cycle detection, or absence of cycles in the graph relative to the specified node.**
