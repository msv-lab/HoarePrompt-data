Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `graph[node]` is not empty, and `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `visited[neighbor]` is False, the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns False, indicating that `neighbor` was not visited, or, if `visited[neighbor]` is True, then `rec_stack[neighbor]` is False, suggesting that `neighbor` is part of a different call stack.***
