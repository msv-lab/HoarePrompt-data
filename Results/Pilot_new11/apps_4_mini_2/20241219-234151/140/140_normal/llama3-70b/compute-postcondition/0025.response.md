The variable `rec_stack[node]` is being assigned the value `False`. This indicates that the current `node` is being removed from the recursion stack, signifying that the depth-first search (DFS) for this node is complete and no cycles are detected involving this node.

The initial conditions state that `visited[node]` is True and `rec_stack[node]` is True, meaning that the `node` was previously visited and is currently in the recursion stack.

After executing the code, only the `rec_stack[node]` value changes from True to False. The other states remain intact as there are no further modifications to them.

Output State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is False, `visited` indicates all reachable nodes from `node` that were processed, and there is no cycle detected in neighbors of `node`.**
