To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the nature of the for loop.

1. **Understanding the variables**:
   - `node`: This is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, which is a valid index for the graph.
   - `graph`: This is a list of lists that represents directed edges, where `graph[node]` represents a list of neighbors (edges) for the given `node`.
   - `visited[node]`: This indicates that the current `node` has already been visited. 
   - `rec_stack[node]`: This indicates that the current `node` is in the recursion stack during the traversal.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop `for neighbor in graph[node]:` will execute if `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor. Therefore, we need to ensure that `graph[node]` is a valid list and has elements.

3. **Necessary State Adjustments**:
   - The `graph` must have valid edges from `node`. Specifically, for the loop to execute, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. This means we need to adjust the state to state that `graph[node]` must not be an empty list.
   - The variable `neighbor` will be assigned the first element of `graph[node]` during the first iteration.

With these considerations in mind, the adjusted state can be described as follows:

State: **`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `graph[node]` must not be empty, neighbor is the first neighbor in graph[node]**.
