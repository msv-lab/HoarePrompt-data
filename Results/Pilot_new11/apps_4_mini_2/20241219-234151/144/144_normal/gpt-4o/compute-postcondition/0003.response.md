The variable `mex` is assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order; `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `mex` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order; `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `mex` is 1.**
