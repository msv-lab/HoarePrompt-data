According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` positive integers and `n` is at least 2, the loop will iterate over each element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, and since `n` is at least 2, there is still at least one more element to iterate over.

From the provided information, `num` is currently the second element in `a`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `num` will need to be updated to the third element in the list. Additionally, the `mex` value could potentially be affected depending on `num`'s comparison with the current `mex`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order, where `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, and `mex` is unchanged (unless specified otherwise)**.
