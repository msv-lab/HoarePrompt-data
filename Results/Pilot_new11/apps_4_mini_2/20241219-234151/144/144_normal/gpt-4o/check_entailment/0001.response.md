Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the maximum possible value of mex for the given constraints and operates as intended according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of elements and the list of integers.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the array to facilitate sequential checking for the minimum missing positive integer.
3. **Mex Calculation**: Using a simple loop, it keeps track of the current `mex` value starting from 1. If the current number in the sorted array is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex`, effectively marking that integer as present and proceeding to search for the next potential `mex`.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated `mex`.

The algorithm is efficient and works within the problem constraints. I have not found any specific cases in which it fails to produce the correct output based on the problem's requirements. The examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly, as the program generates the correct output for both cases provided. Thus, after thorough consideration of possible edge cases and the logical flow of the program, I conclude it is correct.
