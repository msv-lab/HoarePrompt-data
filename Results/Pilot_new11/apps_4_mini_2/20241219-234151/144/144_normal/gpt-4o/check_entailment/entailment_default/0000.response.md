The provided program reads a list of positive integers, sorts it, and computes the maximum possible value of `mex`. The approach used is to iterate through the sorted array and increase the `mex` counter whenever an element greater than or equal to the current `mex` is found.

However, there is a subtle issue in the approach when the values in the list are not distinct. For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
The expected output is `2`, since the only positive integer we can form is `1`, and `mex` will be `2` because `2` is not present in the modified array. However, the code will yield `2` instantly since it checks the first `1` and increments `mex` to `2` after the first iteration, but in this case, there are multiple `1`s that do not allow higher integers to be formed because the necessary integers are not present.

Moreover, if `a` has elements like `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the computed `mex` will behave accurately and will result in `4`. But in scenarios like `[2, 2]`, the output should be `1` as we cannot adjust `mex` since `1` cannot be produced with fewer than `2` operations.

Thus, the program fails to account for certain cases where identical integers prevent the formation of a required sequence to increment `mex`.

Correctness: **False**.
