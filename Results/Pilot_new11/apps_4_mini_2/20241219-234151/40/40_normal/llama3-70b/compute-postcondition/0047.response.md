Given the provided initial state and the loop code, here's the analysis of the final output state after all iterations of the loop:

Initial State: `s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings found in `s` starting from index 1.

The loop executes for `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 3) to `n + 1`. Thus, the loop will run `n - 2` times, iterating through possible substrings of `s` that start from index `i` (2).

After all iterations of the loop have completed, the variables will have the following values:
- `s` remains unchanged as the initial user-input string of lowercase English letters.
- `n` remains unchanged, but it is still greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` remains constant at 2.
- `j` will be equal to `n + 1` (which is its initial value).
- `max_len` will reflect the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings that were found during the iterations of the loop, which may have been updated based on the comparison of substrings and their lengths.

As such, in the case where the loop executes fully, and assuming that there are both palindromic and non-palindromic substrings in the string `s`, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the initial value, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings in `s` starting from index 1.**
