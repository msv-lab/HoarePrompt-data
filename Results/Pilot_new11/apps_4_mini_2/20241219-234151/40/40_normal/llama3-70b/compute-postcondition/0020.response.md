The variable `substr` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, which means `substr` will contain the characters from index 1 to index 2 of the string `s`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes `s` as the user-input string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found in `s`, `j` is 2, and finally `substr` is assigned the substring `s[1:2]`.

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found in `s`, `j` is 2, `substr` is `s[1:2]`.**
