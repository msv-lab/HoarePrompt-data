Postcondition: ***`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index 2 to 4. If `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. The else part is not applicable as there is no else condition defined.***
