According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The variable `i` is currently 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, allowing the loop to execute. After the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `i` will now be 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must hold true. Since `i` is now 2, for the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings found in `s` starting from index 1.**
