According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `j = i + 1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3 after the next iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, for the next iteration, `j` must be less than or equal to at least 3 (which is feasible since `n` is greater than 1).

Thus, the updated state will be:
State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `substr` is the first two characters of `s`.**
