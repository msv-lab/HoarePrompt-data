The value of `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`. Assuming `s` is a user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` will represent the number of characters in that string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the integer value representing `len(s)`.

Output State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` is the integer value equal to `len(s)`**.
