According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from `i + 1` (which is 3) to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3. 

Given that `i` is currently 2, the starting value for `j` will be 3 (`i + 1`). The ending value for `j` will be `n + 1`, which means that the loop will continue until it reaches `n` (inclusive). If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop will have valid iterations.

Thus, the necessary states are:
- `n` must be at least 3 to ensure the loop executes.
- `j` is initially set to 3 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the required adjustments are that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is now 3.

State: **`s` is the user-input string of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is now 3, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings found in `s` starting from index 1.**
