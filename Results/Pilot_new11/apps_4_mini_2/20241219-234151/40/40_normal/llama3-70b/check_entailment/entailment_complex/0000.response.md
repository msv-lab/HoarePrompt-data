Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads a single non-empty string `s` containing lowercase English letters, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Logic for Non-palindromic Substrings**:
   - It utilizes nested loops to generate and evaluate all possible substrings of `s`. The outer loop iterates through potential starting indices of substrings, while the inner loop iterates through potential ending indices. This ensures that all substrings are considered.
   - For each substring generated, it checks if the substring is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`). This is the correct logic to determine if a substring is a palindrome.

3. **Tracking the Maximum Length**:
   - The program maintains a variable `max_len` which stores the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found. This adheres to the requirement of calculating the longest non-palindromic substring.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints `max_len` if it is greater than 0. This matches the requirement to return the length of the longest non-palindromic substring or 0 if all substrings in `s` are palindromic.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases effectively. For instance, if the input string contains only one character, all substrings will inherently be palindromic, leading to a correct output of 0.

6. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program respects the input length constraint (up to 50 characters) as it does not exceed memory or processing limitations.

Overall, the structure and flow of the program align perfectly with the requirements set forth in the problem description, covering all necessary logical conditions and edge cases without exceptions. Therefore, the verification concludes that the implementation accurately reflects the task at hand, yielding the expected outcomes for all valid inputs.
