The provided program attempts to determine the length of the longest substring of a given string that is not a palindrome. Let's analyze the code based on the problem description and the requirements to identify any potential pitfalls.

1. **Identifying Palindrome**: The function `func_1(s)` checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing the string with its reverse.

2. **Key conditions**:
   - If the length of the string `s` is 1 or less, it correctly returns `0`, as there's no non-palindromic substring possible.
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it returns the length of `s`.
   - It also checks the substrings by removing the first character (`s[1:]`) and the last character (`s[:-1]`). If either of these substrings is not a palindrome, it returns their respective lengths.

3. **Potential issues**: 
   - The program does not consider cases where the whole string could be a palindrome but still have a longer non-palindrome substring contained within it. 
   - For instance, if the string were "aab", the whole string is not checked directly for a non-palindromic substring of length 3, while it can have "aa" (length 2) which is a palindrome but also allows for the whole string to be counted as not a palindrome as expected. 

4. **Specific counterexample**:
   - Consider the string "abcba". The string itself is a palindrome (length 5), but if we took `s[:-1]`, which results in "abcb", we see that it has no further substrings of length 4 that would get checked, leading to a minimum case of just `0` being returned.

Because of these points, particularly the failure to cover all possibilities effectively leaving valid cases ignored when the function logic checks only the trimmed edges of the string (and possible palindromes being too strictly filtered), it will lead to incorrect outputs in examples where non-trivial non-palindromic substrings exist.

Given that there are examples where the code will return incorrect values based on the relations stated above, I determine the program is incomplete and mistakenly designed for the outlined task.

Correctness: **False**.
