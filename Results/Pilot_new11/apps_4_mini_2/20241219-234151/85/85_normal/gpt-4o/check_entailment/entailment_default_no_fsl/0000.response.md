Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of pairs of shovels that add up to a cost ending with the maximum possible number of nines. It misinterprets the problem by focusing on the number of trailing nines in the input value `n` rather than calculating valid pairs of shovel costs.

For example:
- In the case where `n = 7`, the expected output is `3`, representing the pairs (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5). However, when the program runs, it calculates `max_9s` (which will never find any trailing nines in `n = 7`), and then proceeds to produce output as `(7 + 1) * 0`, resulting in `0`.

- Similarly, for `n = 14`, the expected output is `9`, but the programâ€™s logic will again incorrectly focus only on how many trailing nines are in `n`, ending up with an erroneous calculation.

Thus, the program fails to handle the core requirement of counting valid pairs based on their costs, making it incorrect for every potential case outlined in the problem description.
