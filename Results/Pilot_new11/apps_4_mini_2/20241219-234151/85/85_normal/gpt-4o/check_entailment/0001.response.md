Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum number of nines based on the problem description. 

To illustrate this, let's consider an example:

For `n = 3`, the shovels and their costs are:
- Shovel 1: cost 1
- Shovel 2: cost 2
- Shovel 3: cost 3

The possible pairs of shovels and their total costs are:
- Pair (1, 2): total cost = 3 (ends with 0 nines)
- Pair (1, 3): total cost = 4 (ends with 0 nines)
- Pair (2, 3): total cost = 5 (ends with 0 nines)

In total, we have 0 pairs that end with nines. The maximum number of nines that can be obtained is `0`, and there is 1 way to achieve that (since none of the pairs add up to anything ending in 9).

However, let's see how the code behaves with `n = 3`:
1. The while loop checks if `(3 + 1) % 10 == 0`, which is `True`. It would add 1 to `max_9s` and then reduce `n` to `0` (since `3 // 10` is `0`). It exits the loop.
2. Then, `pairs` is calculated as `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which equates to `(0 + 1) * 1 = 1`.

The output suggests that there is 1 pair, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Thus, the program fails to return the correct output for this and potentially other cases, demonstrating that it is incorrect overall.
