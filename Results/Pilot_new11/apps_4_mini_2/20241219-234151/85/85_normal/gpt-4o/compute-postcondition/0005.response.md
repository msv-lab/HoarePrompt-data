According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` means that for the loop to execute again, `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0 or 1. 

- If `n` is 0, then `n + 1` equals 1, and the condition `(1 % 10 == 0)` is false. 
- If `n` is 1, then `n + 1` equals 2, and the condition `(2 % 10 == 0)` is also false.

In both cases, the loop cannot execute again because the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a value such that `n + 1` is 10 or a higher multiple of 10. The smallest value of `n` that satisfies this is `n` must be 9.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 1**
