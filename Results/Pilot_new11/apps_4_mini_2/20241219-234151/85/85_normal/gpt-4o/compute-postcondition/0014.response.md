The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly in its declaration. However, it is implied that the function operates on an integer `n` which is subject to the constraint that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). Given that there are no provided outputs or cases from the function's body, we cannot detail specific return values or behaviors without that information. Therefore, based solely on the provided constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and performs operations based on that integer. The specific output or behavior is not defined.**
