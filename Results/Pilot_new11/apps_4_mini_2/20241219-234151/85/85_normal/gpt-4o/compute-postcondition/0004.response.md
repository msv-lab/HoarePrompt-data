After executing the code, `n` is assigned the value of `n // 10`. Since `n` must be 9 or greater, the possible values for `n` after the integer division by 10 will be 0 or 1 (if `n` is 9 or 10, respectively). The state of the variable `max_9s` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is 0 or 1; `max_9s` is 1**
