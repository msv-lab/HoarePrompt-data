The function reads an integer `n` from input, which should be between 2 and 10^9 inclusive. It then counts how many integer pairs `(i, n - i)` exist for `i` ranging from 1 to `n // 2` such that the sum `i + (n - i)` is a multiple of a power of 10 that corresponds to the number of digits in that sum minus 1. Finally, it prints the count of these valid pairs. Note that the function does not return a value but outputs the result directly via print. There is no handling for invalid input; if the input is outside the specified bounds, the behavior is undefined. Additionally, there's no input mechanism to ensure `n` falls within the required range prior to processing.
