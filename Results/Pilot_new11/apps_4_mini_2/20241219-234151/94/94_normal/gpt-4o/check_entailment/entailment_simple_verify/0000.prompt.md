You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
from collections import deque
#Function 1:
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]

#Function 2:
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem statement and the provided code.

The problem requires determining if two 2x2 sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration through a series of moves. The moves consist of sliding a tile (either 'A', 'B', or 'C') into an adjacent empty space (labeled 'X').

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function simply concatenates the two rows of the puzzle grids into one string, which is likely meant to represent the puzzle state. However, this function is defined but never used in the code.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore all reachable states from the initial configuration given as `start`. It enqueues all unique configurations into a set called `visited`.
   - The current state is checked for possible moves based on the position of 'X' (the empty space). For each move, it generates a new state and adds it to the queue if it has not been visited.
   - The return value is the set of all visited states.

### Missing Logic

The code does not seem to provide a final comparison between Bessie's and Elsie's configurations. It prepares to explore states for one puzzle but does not include logic to apply this exploration to both puzzles and determine if they can reach the same configuration.

**Potential Case Where It Fails:**
- If we call `func_2` for both Bessie's and Elsie's configurations separately, we would miss the final step of checking if both puzzles have at least one common state in their visited states.
- This means that even if one puzzle can reach multiple configurations, if those configurations do not match the other puzzle's configurations, we cannot deduce that they can reach the same configuration. 

### Conclusion

Since the provided code does not complete the required task as per the problem description by lacking the comparison between the two configurations, it is not correctly solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not satisfy the problem's requirements as it fails to determine whether both puzzles can reach the same configuration.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from collections import deque

bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
bessie_start = func_1(bessie_puzzle)
elsie_start = func_1(elsie_puzzle)
bessie_reachable = func_2(bessie_start)
elsie_reachable = func_2(elsie_start)
if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle is a list containing exactly two strings, each string is of length 2 consisting of exactly three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character 'X'.
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]
    #The program returns the concatenation of the first and second strings in the 'puzzle' list, which are each of length 2 consisting of exactly three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character 'X'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X', representing the initial configuration of the sliding puzzle on a 2 × 2 grid.
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

        current = queue.popleft()

        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos
                    ], new_state[empty_pos]
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid sequences of swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` is empty as all reachable unique states from `start` have been explored; `current` is the last state processed before `queue` became empty; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, which no longer changes; `empty_row` and `empty_col` represent the final coordinates of 'X' at the end of the iterations; if no valid moves were possible, `visited` will contain only `start` and `queue` will be empty.
    return visited
    #The program returns the set of all unique states formed by valid sequences of swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters, as stored in 'visited'. If no valid moves were possible, 'visited' contains only the initial state 'start'.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
