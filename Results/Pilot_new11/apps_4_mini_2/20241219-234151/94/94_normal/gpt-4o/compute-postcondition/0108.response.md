The variable `new_state_str` is assigned the value created by joining the elements of `new_state`. The initial state specifies that `new_state` has undergone a swap of two values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, altering the order of the elements in `new_state`. The length and content of `start` remain unchanged, and the same applies to `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and their derived values `new_row` and `new_col`. 

The contents of `new_state_str` will reflect the newly ordered elements from `new_state`. Consequently, `new_state_str` will be a string representation of that array after the swap. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state` after the swap; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, and `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
