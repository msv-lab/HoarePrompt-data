The code snippet adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The variable `new_state_str` is formed from the elements of `new_state` after a swap, but the exact content of `new_state_str` is not specified in the current state. Therefore, its actual value is unknown.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state` after the swap; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`.**
