To calculate the new position `new_pos`, we first evaluate the new values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the initial state. The variable `new_pos` is computed as follows:

- `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col`

Given the initial state, we have:
- `new_row` is equal to `r + dr`
- `new_col` is equal to `c + dc`

Thus, we can express `new_pos` explicitly in terms of `r`, `dr`, `c`, and `dc`:

- `new_pos = (r + dr) * 2 + (c + dc)`

Since we don't have specific values for `r`, `dr`, `c`, and `dc`, but we keep the relationships valid. The values of the other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; `new_pos` is calculated as (r + dr) * 2 + (c + dc)**
