The code snippet involves swapping elements in the list `new_state`. 

1. The variables `empty_pos`, `new_pos`, and `new_state` are involved in the swapping operation.
2. `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are assigned to each other, effectively swapping their values.
3. The initial values of `new_state`, `empty_pos`, and `new_pos` are not explicitly given, but we assume that `new_state` is derived from `current`, and `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been calculated based on the values of `empty_row`, `dr`, `empty_col`, and `dc`.

The results after the operation:
- The specific values in `new_state` at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` will change due to the swap.

Since we don't have specific values for `empty_pos`, `new_pos`, or the contents of `new_state`, we cannot define the exact outcome of the elements at those positions. 

However, we can confirm that:
- The configuration of `new_state` has changed at the two positions indexed by `empty_pos` and `new_pos` after the swap.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state` has been updated with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
