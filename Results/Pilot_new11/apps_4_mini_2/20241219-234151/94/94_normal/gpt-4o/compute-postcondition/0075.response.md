Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; and `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`. If the new position is within bounds (i.e., `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`), if `new_state_str` was not previously visited, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and appended to `queue`. If `new_state_str` was already visited, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`. If `new_row` or `new_col` is out of bounds, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`.***
