The variable `empty_pos` is assigned the index of the character 'X' in the string `current`. The state of `current` is not explicitly defined, but it is known to contain one 'X'. The other variables `start`, `visited`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the information about these variables.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states obtained by swapping 'X' with its adjacent characters in the grid; `queue` must contain at least one reachable state from `start`; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
