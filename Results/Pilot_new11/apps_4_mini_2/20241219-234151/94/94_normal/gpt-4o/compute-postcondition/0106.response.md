The variable `new_state` is assigned the value of the list created from `current`. This action does not modify other variables. The previous value of `current` is unknown, so `new_state` reflects the contents of `current` converted to a list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list of the current contents of the variable `current`.**
