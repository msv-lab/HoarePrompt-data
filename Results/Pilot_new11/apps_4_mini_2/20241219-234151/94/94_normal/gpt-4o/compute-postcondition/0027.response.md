Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` includes `new_state_str`. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`.***
