The code snippet appends `new_state_str` to `queue`. The `queue` variable is modified, but none of the other variables in the initial state are changed by this operation. The states of the other variables remain intact, so the output state incorporates only the change to `queue`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`; `new_state_str` has been added to `visited`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.**
