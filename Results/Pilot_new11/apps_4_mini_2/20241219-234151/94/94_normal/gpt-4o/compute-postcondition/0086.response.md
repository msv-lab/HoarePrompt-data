The code swaps the characters at the indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list, effectively moving 'X' to a new position and the character that was previously in that position to the position of 'X'. 

Given the following assignments:
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `new_pos` is calculated based on `new_row` and `new_col`, which are derived from the new position attempted for 'X'.

The output state reflects the swap of the characters at those positions while maintaining the integrity of the other variables.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` must not be empty; `current` is a specific string representation of a state; `empty_pos` now corresponds to `new_pos`, reflecting the character swap; `new_state` is the list representation of `current` with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.**
