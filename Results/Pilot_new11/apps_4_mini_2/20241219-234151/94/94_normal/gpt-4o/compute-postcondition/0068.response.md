The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are dependent on the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` adjusted by the direction values `dr` and `dc`, respectively, where `new_row` equals `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` equals `empty_col + dc`. Therefore, the exact value of `new_pos` depends on the earlier established values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
