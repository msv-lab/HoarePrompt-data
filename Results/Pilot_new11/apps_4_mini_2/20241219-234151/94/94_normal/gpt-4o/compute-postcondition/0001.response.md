The variable `visited` is assigned a set containing the string `start`. The value of `start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'. Therefore, `visited` will contain exactly that one string as its single element. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing the value of `start`; `visited` is set containing the value of `start`.**
