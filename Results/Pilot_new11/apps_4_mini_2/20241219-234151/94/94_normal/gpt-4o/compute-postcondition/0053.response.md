Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now contains at least one reachable state from `start` plus `new_state_str`; `directions` is defined and contains at least one direction; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is the integer division of `empty_pos` by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `new_state_str` is the string representation of the list resulting from swapping the positions of 'X' and its adjacent character which is not in `visited` before this operation; and `new_state_str` has been added to `queue`.**
