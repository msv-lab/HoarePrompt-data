The code assigns the value of `i` to `x1`. The initial value of `i` is `0`, so `x1` will also be `0`. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a 2D list representing a 2x2 grid containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `puzzle2` is a 2D list representing a 2x2 grid containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 0; `x1` is 0.**
