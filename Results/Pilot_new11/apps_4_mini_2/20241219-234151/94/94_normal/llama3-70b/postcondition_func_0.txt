The function accepts two 2D lists, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each representing a 2x2 grid that contains exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. It identifies the row indices of 'X' in both puzzles, swaps the rows containing 'X' between the two puzzles, and then checks if the sorted contents of `puzzle1` are equal to the sorted contents of `puzzle2`. The function returns a boolean value indicating the equality of the sorted lists after the swap operation. It is important to note that the function assumes the input lists always contain valid elements and may not handle cases where 'X' is not present, duplicates exist, or the lists are not in 2x2 format, which could lead to errors or incorrect behavior.
