Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if two given 2x2 sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration. The key issue is that the swap operation between the tiles is incorrectly applied. By simply swapping the tiles where 'X' is located, the program ignores the possible sequences of moves that can occur to rearrange the tiles, effectively disregarding the sliding puzzle mechanics.

For instance, consider the input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
According to the problem, Bessie has the configuration 'AB/XC' and Elsie has 'AC/BX'. The program would mistakenly attempt to swap the positions of 'X' between the two puzzles, resulting in both puzzles evaluating to 'AC/BX' after the swap. This does not correctly represent whether the two puzzles can actually reach the same configuration through valid moves. 

Moreover, the program uses sorting to check for equality of the configurations, which is not sufficient since the positional arrangement of tiles also matters and two identical sets of tiles can be in different configurations.

The absence of consideration for the sliding movement rules invalidates the determination of whether they reach the same configuration, thus leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect for all potential cases.
