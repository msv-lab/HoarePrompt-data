The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, the new value of `temp_counter` becomes greater than `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `moves` is a list containing formatted strings where `moves` includes `move {regulars[0]} {temp_counter}`, `regulars` has at least 1 element, `i` is still 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, `regulars[0]` is now equal to `str(temp_counter)`.**
