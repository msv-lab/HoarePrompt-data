In the given code, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Prior to this code execution, `temp_counter` had a value that is less than or equal to `2n`, and because it is incremented by 1, its new value will now be at most `2n + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, including the list `files`, integer `n`, list `examples`, integer `i`, and the condition `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and is now ≤ 2n + 1; `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.**
