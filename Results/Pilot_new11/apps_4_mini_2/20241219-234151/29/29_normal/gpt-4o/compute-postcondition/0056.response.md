In the current state, for the `while` loop to execute one more time, both conditions `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set` must hold true.

1. `temp_counter` has already been incremented by 1 and is still `≤ 2n`, which means it is possible for it to still be less than or equal to `2n`. There's no need to adjust `temp_counter` for it to potentially execute again, assuming it was already at a valid value.

2. The value of `str(temp_counter)` must also be in `files_set`. Given that `temp_counter` was just incremented, it is necessary to know if `str(temp_counter)` is currently in the `files_set`. Since it is specifically mentioned that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, this condition is satisfied at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` can be incremented again while still satisfying the conditions:

- Since `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1 and is currently `≤ 2n`, it can increment again only if the previous value was less than `2n`.

Therefore, there are no necessary adjustments to either `temp_counter` or `files_set` as both conditions are already satisfied. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list containing at least 3 elements; `i` is 2; `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and is still ≤ 2n; `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.**
