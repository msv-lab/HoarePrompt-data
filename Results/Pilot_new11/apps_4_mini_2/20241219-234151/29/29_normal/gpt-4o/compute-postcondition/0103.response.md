The variable `target` is assigned the value of `len(examples) + i + 1`. The value of `len(examples)` is equal to `n`, and `i` is given as `2`. Therefore, `target` becomes `n + 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 3`.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100000, so `target` will subsequently be in the range of `4` (when `n` is 1) to `100003` (when `n` is 100000). The values of `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `temp_counter`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `n + 3`, and `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1` and not in `files_set`.**
