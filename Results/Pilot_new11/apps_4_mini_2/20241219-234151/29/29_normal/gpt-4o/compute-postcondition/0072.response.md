To determine which states need to be modified in order for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the conditions given in the `while` loop.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

For this loop to execute, two conditions must be satisfied:

1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be an element of `files_set`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `temp_counter` is stated to be at least `2 * n + 1`. 
- Therefore, `temp_counter <= 2 * n` cannot be satisfied as `temp_counter` is guaranteed to be greater than `2 * n`. This requires us to adjust `temp_counter`.

Next, we also need to check the condition regarding `files_set`:
- The condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` may be satisfied if `temp_counter` is adjusted accordingly, but since `temp_counter` needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, we must focus primarily on ensuring that `temp_counter` is adjusted before we check if `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Thus, to allow for the loop to execute once, we need to reduce the value of `temp_counter` to be exactly `2 * n` or lower (for example, `temp_counter` can be adjusted to be `2 * n`).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved; `moves` is a list containing formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, capturing the moves made with the corresponding `temp_counter` values; `temp_counter` must be adjusted to `2 * n`; `regulars` has at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `target` is len(examples) + 1; the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`.
