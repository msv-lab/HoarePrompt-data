The code appends `name` to the list `regulars`. The initial state shows that `name` is the first part of `file`, which is the first string in the list `files`. Other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings that contains at least 1 string, `file` is the first string in the list, `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`, `type_` is not equal to '1', and `regulars` now includes the value of `name`.**
