The value of `temp_counter` is increased by 1. Since `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it remains within the valid range after the increment. The other variables' states are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a non-empty list; `i` is 0; `files_set` must include the string corresponding to the new value of `temp_counter`, which is now increased by 1; `temp_counter` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1.**
