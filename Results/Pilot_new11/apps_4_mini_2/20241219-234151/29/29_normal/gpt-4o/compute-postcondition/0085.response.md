Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `moves` includes formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, `regulars` has at least 1 element, `i` is still 0, `target` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`, and if `regulars[0]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `moves` now contains an additional element `move {regulars[0]} {target}`.***
