The value of `name` is derived from the variable `file`, which is the third string in `files`. The code `regulars.append(name)` adds the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. The previous values of `n`, `files`, `file`, and `type_` remain unchanged, while `regulars` is updated to include the new entry.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings; `file` is the third string in the list; `name` is the first part of `file`; `type_` is the second part of `file`; `regulars` now includes the value `name`.**
