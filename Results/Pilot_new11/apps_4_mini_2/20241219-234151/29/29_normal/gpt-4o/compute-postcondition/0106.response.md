To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is:

```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `temp_counter` is currently incremented by 1, meaning it is at most `2 * n`.
- `temp_counter` must also be a string in the `files_set`.

We need both conditions to hold true for the loop to execute once more:

1. `temp_counter` has to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must exist in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` has already been incremented by 1, it must be adjusted for the loop to execute again. Here are the steps we need to consider:

1. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must still be ≤ `2 * n`. With its current value being at most `2 * n`, no adjustments to `n` are necessary, unless it's approaching the limit.
   
2. Additionally, we need to guarantee that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. If the last value of `temp_counter` (which is now one greater than before) is not present in `files_set`, that condition will prevent another execution. 

Thus, the only potential adjustment needed is to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` exists in `files_set` after incrementing. Since we don't know the current state of `files_set`, we can't determine if `str(temp_counter)` is present or not.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we can conclude that `temp_counter` must remain within bounds of `2 * n` and need the corresponding string representation to be present in `files_set`.

Given this analysis, we summarize that:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `n + 3`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 and must be ≤ 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
