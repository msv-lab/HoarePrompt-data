The code splits the string `file` into two parts: `name` and `type_`. Since `file` is the third string in the list `files`, we assume it contains at least two spaces separating two parts. `name` takes the first part of `file`, and `type_` takes the second part. The output state will reflect the updated values of `name` and `type_`, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings; `file` is the third string in the list; `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`.**
