`name` and `type_` are assigned the respective values from the split operation on the first string in the `files` list. The string `file` is equal to `files[0]`, and the outcome of `file.split()` will generate two parts, assigning the first part to `name` and the second part to `type_`. The initial conditions on `n` and the `files` list remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least 1 string, `file` is the first string in the list, `name` is the first part of `file`, `type_` is the second part of `file`.**
