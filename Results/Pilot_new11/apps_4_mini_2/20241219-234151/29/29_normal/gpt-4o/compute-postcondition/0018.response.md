Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings; `file` is the third string in the list; `name` is the first part of `file`; if `type_` is '1', then `examples` now includes `name`. Otherwise, `regulars` now includes the value `name`.***
