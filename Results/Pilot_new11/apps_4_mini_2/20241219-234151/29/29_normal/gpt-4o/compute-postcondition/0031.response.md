The code `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. This string includes the value of `examples[i]` and `temp_counter`. Given that `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1, the value of `temp_counter` is within this range, and we can infer that the string representation of `temp_counter` is valid since the loop terminated due to the condition that it is not in `files_set`.

Therefore, the state of the program will reflect the addition of the new formatted string to the `moves` list, while retaining the existing state of all other variables.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * n + 1; `files_set` must include the string representation of all integers from 0 to `temp_counter - 1`; the loop has terminated because either `temp_counter` is greater than 2 * n or the string representation of `temp_counter` is not in `files_set`; `moves` now includes `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`.**
