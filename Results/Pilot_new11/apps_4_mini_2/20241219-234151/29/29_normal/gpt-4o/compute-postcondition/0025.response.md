The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `temp_counter` is not given, so we cannot specify its new exact value. However, the other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a non-empty list; `i` is 0; `files_set` must include the string "0"; and `temp_counter` is increased by 1.
