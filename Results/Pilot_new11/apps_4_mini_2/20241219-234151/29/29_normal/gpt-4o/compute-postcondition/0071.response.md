Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved; `moves` is a list containing formatted strings for each element in `examples` that was not initially equal to its index plus one, capturing the moves made with the corresponding `temp_counter` values; `temp_counter` is at least `2 * n + 1` if any examples were moved; `regulars` has at least 1 element; `i` is 0; `target` is len(examples) + 1; the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`.***
