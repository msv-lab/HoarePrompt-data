The variable `moves` is updated by appending a formatted string that includes the value of `examples[i]` and `temp_counter`. The `temp_counter` is `2n + 1`, and since it is a defined constant based on the value of `n`, we can state that `temp_counter` is a specific value based on `n` in the defined limits. The other variables remain unchanged, and `moves` is now affected by the addition of the specific formatted string.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is 2n + 1, `n` is as per the original defined limits (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least n strings with `str(temp_counter - 1)` present in `files_set` prior to exit, `moves` has a new element added: the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`.**
