The variable `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is `2n + 1`, so after the increment, the new value becomes `2n + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `2n + 2`. 

Other variables remain unaffected:
- `n` still lies in the limits (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
- `files` continues to contain at least `n` strings, including `str(temp_counter - 1)` which would now be `str(2n + 1)`.
- The `moves` list has an additional element added: `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}`, with `examples[i]` being the string representation of `2n + 1`, meaning the string added to `moves` will reference the previous `temp_counter`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated values of `temp_counter` and confirms the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2n + 2`, `n` is as per the original defined limits (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` contains at least `n` strings with `str(2n + 1)` present in `files_set` prior to exit, `moves` has a new element added: the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` where `examples[i]` is the string representation of `2n + 1`.**
