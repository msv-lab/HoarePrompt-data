According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `files_set`. The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` has been increased by 1.

Since `temp_counter` is increased by 1, we must analyze the following conditions:
1. We know `temp_counter` must remain less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` also needs to be present in `files_set` to ensure the loop can execute again.

Currently, since `temp_counter` has just been incremented, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
- `temp_counter` should still be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` needs to be added to `files_set`.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `n` as it is already within its bounds. However, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `temp_counter` still satisfies the condition alongside `files_set`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `files` is a list of strings containing at least `n` strings; `examples` is a non-empty list; `i` is 0; `files_set` must include the string corresponding to the new value of `temp_counter` (which is increased by 1); `temp_counter` is less than or equal to 2 * n**.
