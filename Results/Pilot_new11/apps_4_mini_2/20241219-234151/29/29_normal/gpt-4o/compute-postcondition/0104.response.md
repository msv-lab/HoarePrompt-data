To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition under which the while loop operates.

The while loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

1. The first part of the condition, `temp_counter <= 2 * n`, needs to hold true for the loop to execute. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, this condition is currently false. Therefore, this is the first state that needs adjustment.

2. The second part of the condition, `str(temp_counter) in files_set`, must be true for the loop to execute. Since `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n + 1`, it is likely that its string representation is not present in `files_set` as it would exceed typical indices, especially since `n` can only go up to 100,000.

Based on the above analysis:

- First, `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted so that it becomes less than or equal to `2 * n`. This can be done by changing `temp_counter` to any value from the range `[2, 2 * n]`.

- Secondly, `temp_counter` also needs to be an appropriate value that corresponds to a string representation appearing in `files_set`. However, from the current context, we cannot derive a specific value for `temp_counter` that meets this criterion without additional information about `files_set`.

Therefore, a feasible adjustment to ensure that the loop can execute at least once would be:

- Set `temp_counter` to a value that is not only less than or equal to `2 * n` but also believed to be present in `files_set`. We can set it to `2 * n` initially while ensuring it can be represented in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000), `files` is a list containing at least `n` strings, `examples` is a list where each element equals its respective index plus one as a string if it was equal to that index and was not moved, `regulars` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `n + 3`, and `temp_counter must be adjusted to ≤ 2 * n and equal to a string in files_set**
