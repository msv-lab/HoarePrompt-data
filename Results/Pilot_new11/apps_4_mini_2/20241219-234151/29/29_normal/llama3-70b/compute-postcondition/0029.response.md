Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing all first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing strings `['move {file} 1', ..., 'move {file} k', 'move {file} {len(examples) + 1}', 'move {file} {len(examples) + 2}', ..., 'move {file} {len(examples) + len(regular)}']` for each file in `regular`, `file` is the last element in `regular`, and `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`.**
