To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by their second element in descending order.
   - `examples` is a list derived from `files`, containing the first elements of tuples where the second element is equal to 1.
   - `regular` is a list derived from `files`, containing all first elements of tuples where the second element is equal to 0.
   - `script` is a list with strings of length equal to `len(regular)`.
   - `file` is assigned the last element in `regular`.
   - `i` is set to `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
   - Lastly, `len(script)` must equal `len(regular)`.

2. **For Loop**:
   The for loop executes on `script`, which is a list. For the loop to execute, `script` must contain at least one element.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - If `script` is empty, the loop will not execute. Hence, `len(script)` must be greater than 0, which implies that `len(regular)` must also be greater than 0 because `len(script) = len(regular)`.

4. **Final State Requirements**:
   - We confirm that `regular` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `file` is the last element of `regular`, `file` would also be defined if `regular` has elements.
   - Furthermore, `i` will need adjusting but will already be set correctly since it is based on the lengths of `examples` and `regular`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the essential condition needed before the loop starts is that `len(regular)` must be greater than 0, ensuring that `script` is not empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing all first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0 and must have at least 1 element, `script` is a list containing strings of length `len(regular)`, `file` is the last element in `regular`, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`, `len(script)` is equal to `len(regular)`**
