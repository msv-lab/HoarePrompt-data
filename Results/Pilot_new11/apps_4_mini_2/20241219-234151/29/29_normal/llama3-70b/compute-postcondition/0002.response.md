According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `files` is an empty list, it does not contribute to the loop execution itself. The only variable that directly impacts the loop's execution is `n`, which is already specified as a positive integer. Additionally, since `_` is used as the loop variable, it does not retain a value that needs to be referenced after the loop executions.

For the loop to execute, `n` must remain unchanged as a positive integer, and the loop will iterate `n` times without altering the state of any other variables. However, since `_` does not hold any value after the loop, we don't need to define any state for it. 

Thus, to summarize the state before the loop starts reflecting the variable `n` and the fact that `files` is initialized as an empty list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is an empty list**
