The variable `name` and `type_` are assigned values from the user input, which is split by spaces. The variable `n` remains greater than 1 but is not directly affected by this operation. Since `files` is a list containing one tuple and a new tuple will be appended to this list, the output state will reflect that `files` will contain additional data per the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is 2; `files` is a list containing one tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)) and the new tuple appended from input.**
