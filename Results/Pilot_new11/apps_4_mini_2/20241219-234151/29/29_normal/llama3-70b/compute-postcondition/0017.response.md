The code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a formatted string to the list `script`. The value of `file` is the first element in `examples`, and `i` is 1. Therefore, the new string that will be appended to `script` is `f'move {file} 1'`, which essentially becomes `move {value_of_file} 1` where `value_of_file` is the content of the first element in `examples`. 

Since `script` is initially empty, it will now contain this new string. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a non-empty list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing `['move {file} 1']`, `file` is the first element in `examples`, `i` is 1**.
