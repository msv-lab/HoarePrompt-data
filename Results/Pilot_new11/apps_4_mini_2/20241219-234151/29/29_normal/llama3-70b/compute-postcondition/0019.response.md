The code appends a formatted string to the `script` list. The formatted string uses the value of `file`, which is the second element of `examples`, and `i`, which is currently 2. The `script` list, which initially contains one element `['move {file} 1']`, will have another string added to it based on the values of `file` and `i`. The other variables retain their prior values. 

Thus, after executing the code, the `script` will now contain two strings: the original plus the new one derived from the `file` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list containing `n` tuples sorted by the second element in descending order, `examples` is a non-empty list containing at least 2 elements, `regular` is a list containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is a list containing `['move {file} 1', 'move {file} 2']`, `file` is the second element in `examples`, `i` is 2**
