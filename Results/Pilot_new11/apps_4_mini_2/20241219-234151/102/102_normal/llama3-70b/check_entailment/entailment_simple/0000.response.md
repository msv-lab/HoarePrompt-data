Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem of checking if Vasya can buy a combination of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars such that he spends exactly `n` burles.

### Explanation of Correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input: `n` (the total amount of money), `a` (the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola), and `b` (the cost of one Bars bar). The input constraints are respected, where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000`.

2. **Looping over possible values of `x`**: The program iterates over possible values of `x`, which represents the number of bottles of Ber-Cola that can be purchased. It starts from `0` and goes up to `n // a`, ensuring that `x` remains a non-negative integer and that it does not attempt to purchase more bottles than can be afforded with `n`.

3. **Calculating `y`**: For each value of `x`, the program calculates the maximum number of Bars bars (`y`) that can be bought with the remaining money after spending `x * a` on Ber-Cola. This is done using integer division `(n - x * a) // b`.

4. **Checking the condition**: The program checks if the condition `x * a + y * b == n` holds true. If it does, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, fulfilling the requirements of the problem.

5. **Handling no valid combination**: If the for loop completes without finding valid values of `x` and `y`, the program outputs "NO", indicating that it's impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

### Conclusion:
The program exhaustively checks all combinations of `x` (from `0` up to the maximum possible number buyable) and determines `y` accordingly. It meets all the requirements of the problem statement, including returning valid output formats and ensuring that both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. The logic is sound, and the approach ensures all possible combinations are considered. Therefore, the program is correctly implemented.
