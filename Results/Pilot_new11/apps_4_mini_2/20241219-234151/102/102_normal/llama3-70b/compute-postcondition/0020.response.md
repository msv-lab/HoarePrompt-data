The code `exit()` is executed, which will terminate the program without modifying any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that program execution has ended.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `y` is equal to `(n - (current value of x + 1) * a) // b`, `x` is incremented by 1, and the program execution has terminated.**
