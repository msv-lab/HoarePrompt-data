To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we must verify if the algorithm implemented in the program can always find two non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that:

\[
x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n
\]

where:

- \( n \) is the total amount of money Vasya has.
- \( a \) is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.
- \( b \) is the cost of one Bars bar.

Let's break down the code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), which represent the necessary parameters.
  
2. **Loop for Possible Values of \( x \)**: The program iterates over possible integers \( x \) from \( 0 \) to \( n // a \). This loop effectively finds all possible quantities of Ber-Cola that Vasya could buy.

3. **Calculating \( y \)**: For each value of \( x \), the program checks if the remaining amount after buying \( x \) bottles of Ber-Cola (i.e., \( n - x \cdot a \)) is divisible by \( b \). If it is, it calculates the corresponding \( y \).

4. **Output**: If a valid combination of \( x \) and \( y \) is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of \( x \) and \( y \). If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints "NO".

The important aspects of the solution that align with the problem specification are:

- The loop checks all possible non-negative quantities of \( x \) up to the maximum \( n // a \).
- The condition \( (n - x \cdot a) \% b == 0 \) effectively checks if the remaining money after buying \( x \) Ber-Cola bottles can be exactly spent on Bars bars, satisfying the requirement of finding non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
- The program does cover all edge cases defined by the problem, including:
  - If \( n < a \) (the loop will still check \( x = 0 \)).
  - The modular arithmetic ensures that only valid \( y \) values lead to a solution.

After thorough examination, it is clear that the provided algorithm implements a straightforward and comprehensive approach to solving the problem stated in the description. It performs the necessary checks and provides answers based on the logical structure of the problem.

Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
