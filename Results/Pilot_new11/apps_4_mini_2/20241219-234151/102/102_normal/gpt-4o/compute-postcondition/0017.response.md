The value of `y` is assigned the result of `(n - x * a) // b`. From the initial state, we know that `n` is at least `a` and `x` is 2. Therefore, we can express `x * a` as `2 * a`. Since it is not the case that `(n - 2 * a)` is divisible by `b`, this means that the expression `(n - 2 * a) % b` is non-zero.

Thus, `y` is determined by the value of `(n - 2 * a) // b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the Output State is: `n` is at least `a`, `x` is 2, and `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`, with the condition that `(n - 2 * a)` is not divisible by `b`.

Output State: **`n` is at least `a`, `x` is 2, `y` is equal to `(n - 2 * a) // b`, and it is not the case that `(n - 2 * a)` is divisible by `b`.**
