The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous bounds of `n`, `a`, and `b` are still valid as they are unaffected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000.**
