To determine the correctness of the program against the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Requirements:
Mishka needs to choose three integers (x1, x2, x3) to switch on the three garlands such that at least one garland is lit during every second starting from the maximum of these three integers. The garland i is lit at seconds x, x + ki, x + 2ki, ..., meaning they light up periodically based on their respective intervals ki.

From the described problem, the goal boils down to finding a way to choose x1, x2, and x3 such that all integers after the maximum of these three are covered by at least one garland lighting up at that moment.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Input Handling:** The program reads three integers k1, k2, and k3 which correspond to the intervals of the garlands.
2. **LCM Calculation:** The program computes the least common multiple (LCM) of k1, k2, and k3, using the formula:
   \[
   lcm = \frac{k1 \cdot k2 \cdot k3}{gcd(k1, k2) \cdot gcd(k2, k3) \cdot gcd(k1, k3)}
   \]
   where `func_1` computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. **Condition Check:** After computing the LCM, the program checks if:
   - The LCM is divisible by k1,
   - The LCM is divisible by k2,
   - The LCM is divisible by k3.
   If all these conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Logical Implication:
- If LCM of the intervals k1, k2, and k3 is divisible by each of them, it implies that the garlands will light up all moments up to and including the LCM. This is because, by definition, an LCM is the smallest multiple that is common to all numbers involved.
- Thus, starting from the maximum of any x1, x2, and x3 chosen before reaching LCM, at least one garland will be lit at every second thereafter.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The mathematical approach involving the LCM and GCD ensures comprehensive coverage of time intervals once the garlands are activated at chosen moments.

Therefore, after evaluating the logic and structure of the provided program against the requirements stated in the problem description, the assessment leads to the conclusion that the program is correct. 

Thus, the final response is:

Correctness: **True**
