According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is non-zero (since in Python, any non-zero integer is considered as `True`). Right before the loop, `b` is an integer and can take values within the range of 1 to 1500. Therefore, for the while loop to execute at least once, `b` must be greater than 0. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `a` and `c` do not influence the execution of this loop.

State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1500, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1500**
