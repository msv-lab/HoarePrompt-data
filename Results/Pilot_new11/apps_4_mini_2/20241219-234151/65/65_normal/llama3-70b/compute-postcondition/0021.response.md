Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique characters in `s` and values represent their counts in `s`, and `max_color_count` is greater than `k` (or undefined if `color_count` is empty).***
