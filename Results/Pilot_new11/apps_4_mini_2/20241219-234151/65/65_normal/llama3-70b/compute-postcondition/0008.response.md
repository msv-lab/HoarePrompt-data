Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `s`, and the dictionary `color_count` is updated such that if `c` is already a key, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `color_count[c]` is set to 1.***
