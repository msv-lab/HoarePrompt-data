You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential edge cases as per the problem description. 

For example, consider the case:
```
Input
1
2
3
```
In this case:
- `a` (lemons) = 1
- `b` (apples) = 2
- `c` (pears) = 3

According to the ratio, the maximum possible compote that can be made would require:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples (as required)
- 4 pears (which we do not have, since we only have 3)

Thus, no compote can be made, and the output should be `0`. However, the program calculates `min_lemon` as `min(1, 2 // 2, 3 // 4)`, which is `min(1, 1, 0)`, resulting in `0`. It then calculates the result as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` which leads to `0 + 0 + 0`, hence the output is indeed `0`.

However, consider this case:
```
Input
0
2
4
```
The program still assumes `min_lemon = 0` if `a=0` but we don't enter edge cases around potential literal misinterpretations of fruit count.

Also, an important distinction not handling invalid test cases like `0` for any of the fruit counts is relevant here.

Thus, while the program may return the correct answer in some cases, it does not meet the robustness that the problem requires. The fruit counts must always be positive as per the problem statement, meaning `0` isn't a valid input scenario, which isn't handled here.

Conclusively, the program lacks the complexity of input validation just around the fruit counts based on the full problem constraints. This leads to the understanding that it is, consequently, not solving the problem as robustly as intended. Thus, the answer is False.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes three positive integer inputs (a, b, and c) from the user, all constrained between 1 and 1000. It calculates the minimum value of a, half of b, and a quarter of c. Using this minimum value, it computes a result by adding it to itself multiplied by 2 and multiplied by 4, and then prints this final result. However, the function does not handle scenarios where any of the inputs are not positive integers or out of the specified range, nor does it return values to another part of a program—it solely prints the output without any form of validation or error handling.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
