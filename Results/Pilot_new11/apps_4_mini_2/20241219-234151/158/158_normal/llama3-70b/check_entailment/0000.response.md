Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used in the compote according to the given recipe ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how it works:
- It reads three integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
- It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`) by taking the minimum of:
  - The number of lemons available (`a`).
  - Half the number of apples (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
  - A quarter of the number of pears (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
- It computes the total count of fruits used in the compote by summing:
  - `min_lemon` (number of lemons),
  - `min_lemon * 2` (number of apples),
  - `min_lemon * 4` (number of pears).

All test cases from the problem description have been handled correctly. For example:
- For input (2, 5, 7): The function calculates that 1 lemon can be used (yielding 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 total fruits).
- For input (4, 7, 13): It determines that 3 lemons can be used (yielding 3 + 6 + 12 = 21 total fruits).
- For input (2, 3, 2): It correctly identifies that no valid compote can be made due to insufficient pears and returns 0.

Thus, the logic and the implementation fulfill the problem requirements for all potential inputs within the specified constraints.
