Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has. These inputs align with the constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000).

2. **Calculating Maximum Amount of Fruits**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the ratio required for compote. The maximum number of lemons (`min_lemon`) is determined by taking the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`).
     - Half of the number of apples (`b // 2`) since two apples are needed for each lemon.
     - A quarter of the number of pears (`c // 4`) since four pears are needed for each lemon.
   This calculation adheres to the specified 1:2:4 ratio.

3. **Total Calculation**: 
   - The program computes the total number of fruits used in the compote as:
     - `1 * min_lemon` for lemons,
     - `2 * min_lemon` for apples,
     - `4 * min_lemon` for pears.
   - This results in `min_lemon + 2 * min_lemon + 4 * min_lemon = 7 * min_lemon`, which correctly reflects the total number of fruits based on the max number of lemons that can be used.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If it turns out that Nikolay cannot use any fruits (for example, not having enough of any fruit to satisfy the minimum ratio), `min_lemon` will be `0`, leading the program to correctly output `0`.

5. **Output**: The function directly prints the total count of fruits used, which matches the expected output format.

Thus, the program accurately and consistently follows the problem description, satisfactorily handles all input constraints, and produces the correct output based on them. Therefore, the correctness determination is **True**.
