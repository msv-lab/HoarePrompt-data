Correctness: **True**.

The program takes inputs for the number of lemons, apples, and pears and calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the specified 1:2:4 ratio. 

1. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can fit into the ratio using `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This correctly ensures that the number of apples is sufficient for the lemons and the number of pears is sufficient for the lemons.
2. It then computes the total number of fruits used based on this maximum number of lemons, following the recipe ratio: 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. 

The code handles all edge cases described in the problem statement effectively, including cases where there aren't enough pears or apples to use any lemons, resulting in a total output of 0. Since the logic adheres to the problem requirements and produces correct outcomes for all possible inputs within the defined constraints, the solution is valid.
