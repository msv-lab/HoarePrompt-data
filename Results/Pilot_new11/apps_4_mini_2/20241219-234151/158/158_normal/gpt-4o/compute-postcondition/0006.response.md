The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output, the function will perform some operations internally with the positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that are bounded by the constraints 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. Since the specific output behavior is not defined in this task, we cannot categorize it into cases. Thus, we can only describe that it operates within the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with positive integers a, b, and c, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000.**
