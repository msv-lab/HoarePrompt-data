The variable `max_lemons` is already defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. The `total_fruits` variable is assigned the value of `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7` since `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. The other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `max_lemons` is `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`; `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `max_lemons` is `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`; `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**.
