You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

The program aims to maximize the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies ('G') after performing at most one swap. It uses the following logic:

1. It calculates the length of the longest contiguous segment of 'G' (without any swaps) and stores it in `max_beauty`.
2. Then it checks for opportunities to increase this length by swapping a 'S' trophy with a 'G' trophy next to it. For each 'G' followed by an 'S', it counts how many consecutive 'G's are on the left and right sides of that position and adds them together.

Now, I need to evaluate whether this logic handles all potential cases correctly.

Consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
Input:
```
5
SGSGS
```
Expected Output: `1`

Explanation:
- The original longest segment of 'G' is `1` (from the indices of the first or third 'G').
- Vova has opportunities to swap:
    - Swap the first 'S' (index 0) with the first 'G' (index 1), yielding 'GGSGS' and the longest segment becomes `2`.
    - Swap the first 'S' (index 1) with the second 'G' (index 2), yielding 'SGGSS' and the longest segment becomes `2`.
- No matter what swap is done, the maximum segment achievable is `2`, hence the result should be `2`.

**However, the program checks for pairs of 'G' and 'S' (i.e., `G` followed by `S`) and only adds the adjacent 'G' segments. This means the drift of 'SG' will not be counted correctly, leading to the absence of cases where segments are wrapped by single 'G'.

It does not correctly account for certain arrangements where swapping non-adjacently can lead to a valid extended segment of 'G's or fails to account that swapping 'G' with 'S' could generate longer segments overall wherever they may be in the sequence. 

The program should also consider the cases where 'G's are entirely surrounded by 'S's or even when no swaps can increase the continuous 'G' segment.

Thus, the invalid logic can lead to incorrect results for some arrangements.

Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to produce the correct result for the input `SGSGS`, where it should return `2` after evaluating the swap options but likely returns `1` following its current logic.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and the second input is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for i, x in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `golden` contains the indices of all 'G's in `s`; `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered at the end of the loop iteration; `max_beauty` is the maximum count of consecutive 'G's found in `s`; `left` is the index of the first 'G' encountered in `s` or `n` if there are no 'G's; `right` is equal to `n`.
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty obtainable with one swap of a 'G' and adjacent 'S', with `s` being the original string. If there are no occurrences of 'G' followed by 'S', then `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0.
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. It calculates the longest sequence of consecutive 'G's in the string, referred to as `max_beauty`. It also computes the maximum potential sequence of consecutive 'G's obtainable by swapping one 'G' with an adjacent 'S', termed `max_beauty_one_swap`. Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. 
The function handles edge cases by ensuring that if there are no 'G's in the string, `max_beauty` will remain 0 (as initialized), and `max_beauty_one_swap` will also remain 0 if there are no valid 'G' followed by 'S' pairs. It effectively considers all possible ways to enhance the beauty score based on given conditions.
