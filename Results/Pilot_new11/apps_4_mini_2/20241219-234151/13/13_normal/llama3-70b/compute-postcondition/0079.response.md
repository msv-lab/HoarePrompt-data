Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n-2`. If the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's before index `i` plus 2. Otherwise, `beauty` remains equal to the number of consecutive 'G's before index `i` plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
