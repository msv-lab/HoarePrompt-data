The variable `curr_beauty` is assigned the value 0, which resets its previous value (whatever it was) to 0. The values of `max_beauty`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged; however, `max_beauty` may need to be updated depending on its previous value and the fact that `curr_beauty` is now 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; `left` is unchanged; `right` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; `left` is unchanged; `right` is equal to `n`.**
