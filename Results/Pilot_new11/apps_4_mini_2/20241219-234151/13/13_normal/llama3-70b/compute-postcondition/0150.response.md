The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or inner conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.
