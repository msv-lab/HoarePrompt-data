Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 4`. If the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `beauty` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
