Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`. If the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to 2. If the character at index `j` is not 'G', then `beauty` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
