The variable `left` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `left` has already been incremented by 1 to a value that is less than `n` and that `s[left]` is 'S'. This means after the increment, `left` will increase from its current value to one more, but it will still remain less than `n`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `curr_beauty` is 0; `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; `left` has been incremented by 1 and remains less than `n` and `s[left]` is 'S'; `left` is updated to its new value (previous value + 1).**
