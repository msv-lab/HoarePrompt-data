According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the starting point determined by `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, meaning it has not directly affected `j` but provides context for `i`, which implicitly relates to how many iterations or checks are made.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was at least `0` (it stops before `-1`). The loop for `j` is defined to start from `i - 1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` was `0`, it would become `-1` in the next iteration, causing the loop to stop.

For the loop to execute one more time, it must have started at `1`, so that when it decrements, it moves to `0`. Consequently, for another execution, we also need to ensure the index `j` is still within bounds, so we have to state that `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Hence, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3; `j` is 1; `beauty` is updated to 2 or remains 1 if character at index `j` is not 'G`.**
