According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `i - 1` to `0`, decrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, so the value of `j` at that point was `n - 2`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

At the end of the last iteration, when `j` was `n - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1. This means that `j` will become `n - 3`. For the loop to continue executing, the condition will require that `i` still fulfills its constraint (since `i` is `n - 1`, the range remains valid as long as `n` is at least `2`).

We do not need to change `n` or `i`, but we need to adjust `j` accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `beauty` can be either 1 or 2 depending on the character at index `j` of string `s`.**
