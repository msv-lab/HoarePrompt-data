To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we should consider the current values of the variables involved and how they interact based on the output from the previous iteration.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `right` in the range of `n`. This means that `right` will take each integer value from 0 to `n - 1`. After the last iteration, `right` would have the value `n - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Last Iteration**: The provided state details that `left` is less than `right`, and describes the string `s` in terms of its characters being 'G' (good) or 'S' (bad):

   - If the character at position `right` in the string `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is set to 1.
   - If it's 'S', the algorithm defines `left` based on where the first 'G' appears in the string up to `right`, and adjusts `curr_beauty` accordingly.

3. **State Changes for the Next Iteration**: After completing the last iteration, the loop will consider the next value for `right`, which should be `n`. However, since the loop is defined to run for `right` in the range of `n`, the maximum value of `right` would be `n - 1`, and there are no more valid integers for `right` to iterate to.

4. **Conclusion**: Since there is no next value for `right` that satisfies the for loop's range condition (as `right` would be equal to `n`, which is out of bounds for the loop), the loop will terminate, and the next iteration cannot occur.

Hence, we reflect this understanding in the state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', `curr_beauty` is unchanged, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `left` is unchanged, and `right` must be equal to `n`**
