The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of an if statement or iteration we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the character at index `j` of string `s` is the character at index 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
