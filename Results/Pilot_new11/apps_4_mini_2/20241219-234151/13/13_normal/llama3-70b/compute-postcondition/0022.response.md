Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'. If the character at position `right` in the string `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is set to 1, while `left` remains 0, and values of `max_beauty` and `right` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' encountered in the string `s` or `right` if no 'G' is found before `right`; the characters at indices `0` to `left - 1` in string `s` are all 'S', `curr_beauty` is set to 1, and values of `max_beauty` and `right` are unchanged, with `left` being less than `right`.***
