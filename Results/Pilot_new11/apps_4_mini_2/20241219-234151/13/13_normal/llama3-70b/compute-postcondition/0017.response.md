The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Since `left` was initially 2, the new value of `left` will be 3. The constraints on the other variables remain unchanged, including the condition that the character at index `left` (now index 3) in string `s` must not be 'G'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S', `right` must be greater than 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 3, and the character at index `left` in string `s` (index 3) must not be 'G'.
