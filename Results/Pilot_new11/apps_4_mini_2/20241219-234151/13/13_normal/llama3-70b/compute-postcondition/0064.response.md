Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S'. If the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2. Otherwise, `beauty` remains 1, and at index `j` of string `s`, the character is not 'G', resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
