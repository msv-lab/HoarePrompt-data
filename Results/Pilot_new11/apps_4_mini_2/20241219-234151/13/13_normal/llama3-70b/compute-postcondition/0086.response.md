The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 3`, and `j` is `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
