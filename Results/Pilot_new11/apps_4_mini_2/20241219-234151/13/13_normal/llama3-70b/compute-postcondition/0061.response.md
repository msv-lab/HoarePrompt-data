The initial state has `beauty` set to 1. The code increments `beauty` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `beauty` will be 2, while all other variables remain unchanged and valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S', `beauty` is 2, and the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G'.**
