The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3; `i` is `n - 2`; `j` is `n - 3`; `max_beauty_one_swap` will continue to be updated; `beauty` is 1; the character at index `j` of `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
