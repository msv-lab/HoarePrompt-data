The variable `beauty` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `i`) are not affected. The value of `n` remains an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, and `i` remains equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `beauty` is 1**.
