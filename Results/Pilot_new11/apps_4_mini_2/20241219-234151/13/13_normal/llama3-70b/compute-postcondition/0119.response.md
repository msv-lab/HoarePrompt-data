The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the conditions regarding `n`, `i`, and `j` remain valid as they do not change. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 4`, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`, and `beauty` is incremented by 1.**
