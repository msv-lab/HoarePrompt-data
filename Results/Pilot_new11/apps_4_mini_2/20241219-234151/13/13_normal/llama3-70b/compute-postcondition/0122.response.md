The loop iterates through the string `s` starting from index `i + 2` and continues until it encounters a character that is not 'G' or until the end of the string is reached. Each time a 'G' is encountered, `beauty` is incremented. If no 'G' is found after the initial condition, `beauty` remains at its original value calculated before the loop.

To summarize the final outcomes depending on the specific conditions after all iterations of the loop:

If the loop executes and finds 'G' characters:
- The value of `beauty` will be equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `s[n-2]` and extending as far as the consecutive 'G's found following index `i + 2`.
- `j` will be the index right after the last 'G' found (the loop will exit when it encounters a non-'G' character or the end of the string).

If the loop does not execute (which occurs if `i` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`):
- `beauty` remains as it was calculated prior to the loop execution.

Given the above conditions, here is the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `beauty` is equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters found starting from `s[n-2]` plus the count of consecutive 'G's from the substring starting at index `i + 2`, which could also mean `beauty` can remain as previously calculated if the loop doesn't execute.**
