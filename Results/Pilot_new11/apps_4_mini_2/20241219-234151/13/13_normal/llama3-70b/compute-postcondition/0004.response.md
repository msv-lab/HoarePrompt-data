In this code snippet, `curr_beauty` is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `curr_beauty` while keeping the previous conditions steady.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list of integers representing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0; `curr_beauty` is 0**
