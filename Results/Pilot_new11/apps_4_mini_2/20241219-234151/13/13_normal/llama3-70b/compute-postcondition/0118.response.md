According to the code, the loop can be executed again if `j` falls within the valid range specified by the for loop, which is from `i + 2` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j = i + 3`, which means that the next value of `j` will be `i + 4`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than `i + 4`.

Given that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, we can summarize the states needed at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the new state needs to indicate that `j` is now `i + 4` and that `n` must be greater than `i + 4` to allow a further execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 4`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 4**.
