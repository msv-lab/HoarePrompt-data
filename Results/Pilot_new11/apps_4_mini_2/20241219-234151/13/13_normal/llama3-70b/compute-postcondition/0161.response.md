The function `func` accepts two parameters: 

1. `n` - an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000.
2. `s` - a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.

The function processes these inputs and based on certain conditions (not specified), it returns one of several possible outputs. Without detailing how it operates, it can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', and returns a result based on the conditions defined within the function.**
