The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n-2`, `s` contains a number of 'G's before index `i`, `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's before index `i` plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
