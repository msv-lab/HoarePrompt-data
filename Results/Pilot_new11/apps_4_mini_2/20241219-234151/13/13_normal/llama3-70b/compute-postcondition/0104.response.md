`beauty` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, still being an integer `n` such that `n` >= 3, and `j` is still 0. The only variable affected here is `beauty`, which increases by 1 based on its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3, `j` is 0, and `beauty` is updated to its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3, `j` is 0, `beauty` is updated to its previous value plus 1**
