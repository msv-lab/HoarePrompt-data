The command `break` terminates the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. However, since the variables are not altered by the `break` statement, the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only clarification is that we break out of the most immediate loop or if statement, since `s[j]` does not lead to breaking the inner loop or condition. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes to the variable values occurred, but the `break` operations have an effect on the control flow.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000` and must be at least `n + 1`; `i` is `n - 1`; `j` is `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
