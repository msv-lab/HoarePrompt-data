The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. It calculates the longest sequence of consecutive 'G's in the string, referred to as `max_beauty`. It also computes the maximum potential sequence of consecutive 'G's obtainable by swapping one 'G' with an adjacent 'S', termed `max_beauty_one_swap`. Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. 
The function handles edge cases by ensuring that if there are no 'G's in the string, `max_beauty` will remain 0 (as initialized), and `max_beauty_one_swap` will also remain 0 if there are no valid 'G' followed by 'S' pairs. It effectively considers all possible ways to enhance the beauty score based on given conditions.
