The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The conditions for the other variables remain unchanged: `n` must still be greater than 2, `start` is still 2, and `trophies[2]` must still be 'G'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is now 3, `start` is 2, and `trophies[2]` must be 'G'.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `start` is 2, and `trophies[2]` must be 'G'**
