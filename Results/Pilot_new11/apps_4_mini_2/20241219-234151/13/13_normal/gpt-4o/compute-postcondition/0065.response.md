Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 3; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is the first element of the third tuple in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the third tuple in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 3 in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 3 in `segments`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum of `max_length` and the sum of `curr_end - curr_start + 1`, `prev_end - prev_start + 1`, and 1. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
