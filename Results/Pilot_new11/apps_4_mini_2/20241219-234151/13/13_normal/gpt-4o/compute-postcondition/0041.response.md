Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, and `i` is equal to the original value of `n` with a starting value of 2. If all `trophies` from index 2 to `n-1` are 'G', then `segments` has a new tuple (2, n - 1) appended. If the element at index `i`, which is 3, of the `trophies` array is not 'G', then the program state is maintained accordingly.***
