You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and trophies is a string of length n containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n` (indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed), and `segments` contains tuples for each contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string. If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will be empty. The original string can have any combination of 'G' and 'S'.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating that there are no segments of 'G' characters found in the trophies string since segments is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed, and `segments` contains at least one tuple for a contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string. If `segments` is not empty, the original string contains at least one 'G' character.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in the string 'trophies'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed, `segments` contains at least one tuple, `max_length` is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in `trophies`, and `segments` contains more than one tuple.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n-2` in `segments`; `curr_start` and `curr_end` are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n-1` in `segments`; `max_length` is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in `trophies`, which may have been updated based on the conditions of the loop. If `segments` has no valid pairs where `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` remains as the maximum length calculated through the iterations.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in trophies, and n is the integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer n and a string trophies, returning 0 if there are no 'G' segments, the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments, and the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in trophies.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0, indicating that there are no segments of 'G' characters found in the trophies string since segments is empty.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in the string 'trophies'

Case_3: The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in trophies, and n is the integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
