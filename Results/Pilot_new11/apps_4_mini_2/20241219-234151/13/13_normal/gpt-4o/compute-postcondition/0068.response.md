The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\), and the parameter `trophies` is a string of length `n`, containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'. 

After executing the function body, the function will behave as follows:
- If there are no segments of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string, the function returns 0.
- If there are segments of 'G', the function returns the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in the string `trophies`.
- Additionally, the function will also return the minimum value between the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments plus 1 and the integer `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and it will return the number of contiguous 'G' segments found; the maximum length of those segments; and the minimum value between the maximum segment length plus one and `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a string trophies, returning 0 if there are no 'G' segments, the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments, and the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in trophies.**
