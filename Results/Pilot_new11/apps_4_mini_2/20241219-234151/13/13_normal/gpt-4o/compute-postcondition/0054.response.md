The code calculates the maximum length by updating `max_length` with a new value based on the current segment and the previous segment. The previous values of the relevant variables are `curr_end`, `curr_start`, `prev_end`, `prev_start`, and `max_length` is not specified in the initial state but will be updated.

Given that:
- `curr_start - prev_end` is exactly 2, we have `curr_start = prev_end + 2`.
- Therefore, `curr_end - curr_start` equals `curr_end - (prev_end + 2)` which can be simplified.
- The calculation for `max_length` then becomes:

```
max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
            = max(max_length, curr_end - (prev_end + 2) + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
            = max(max_length, curr_end - prev_end - 2 + 1 + prev_end - prev_start + 1 + 1)
            = max(max_length, curr_end - prev_start + 1)
```

Thus, `max_length` is now the maximum of its previous value and the length calculated using the current and previous segments.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 1; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is assigned the value from `segments[0][0]; `prev_end` is assigned the value from `segments[0][1]; `curr_start` is assigned the value from `segments[i][0]; `curr_end` is assigned the value from `segments[i][1]; `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - prev_start + 1`.**
