You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided Python program meets the requirements of the given problem description, we will analyze the logic of the code, the implementation details, and potential edge cases.

The problem requires calculating the maximum length of a contiguous segment of golden trophies ('G') that can be formed after making at most one swap between two trophies. 

Here's a breakdown of the program logic:

1. The code reads inputs for the number of trophies and the arrangement of trophies.
2. It identifies segments of golden trophies by looping through the string and recording their start and end positions in the `segments` list.
3. If there are no golden trophies, it returns `0`.
4. It calculates the longest segment of 'G's already present and checks if it can be increased by considering two non-adjacent segments of 'G's that have one 'S' in between, allowing for a swap.
5. The calculation involves checking if the gap between segments is exactly 2 to allow for a valid swap.

**Examining Edge Cases:**
1. When the input only contains 'S' trophies (e.g., "SSSS"), the expected output is `0`, and the function correctly returns `0`.
2. When there is a single segment of 'G's (e.g., "GGGG"), the function should return `4`, which is handled correctly.
3. When `n` trophies consist mainly of 'G's with 'S's making them non-contiguous (e.g., `GSGSG`), we might expect it to correctly identify that the max length can be increased by swapping.

**Potential Failure Cases:**
Consider the input `5` and `GSSGS`. The expected maximum length is `3` after swapping the 'S' trophies, but the program does not check all potential segment combinations and their distances to allow for optimal swaps. In this case, the program may not return the correct result when adjacent 'S's are present.

**Conclusion:**
In the previous analysis, I discovered that the program does not accurately account for every possible scenario where a swap could be beneficial. Specifically, the handling of segments may incorrectly prevent certain swaps that could yield longer contiguous segments.

Thus, based on my examination, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and trophies is a string of length n containing only the characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n` (indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed), and `segments` contains tuples for each contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string. If there are no 'G' characters, `segments` will be empty. The original string can have any combination of 'G' and 'S'.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, indicating that there are no segments of 'G' characters found in the trophies string since segments is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed, and `segments` contains at least one tuple for a contiguous segment of 'G' characters found in the `trophies` string. If `segments` is not empty, the original string contains at least one 'G' character.
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in the string 'trophies'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; after all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the entirety of the `trophies` string has been processed, `segments` contains at least one tuple, `max_length` is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in `trophies`, and `segments` contains more than one tuple.
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` and `prev_end` are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n-2` in `segments`; `curr_start` and `curr_end` are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n-1` in `segments`; `max_length` is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in `trophies`, which may have been updated based on the conditions of the loop. If `segments` has no valid pairs where `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` remains as the maximum length calculated through the iterations.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n, where max_length is the maximum length of contiguous 'G' segments in trophies, and n is the integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000.
