To evaluate the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to examine the logic of the code in detail and identify any potential edge cases or scenarios where it may not produce the correct output as described.

Here's a summary of the logic within the `func_1` function, which is supposed to determine the smallest square frame that fulfills the specifications:

1. The function iterates through the `screen` to identify the boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) where white pixels ('w') are located.
2. It expects to create a frame around these boundaries, and if the detected area (using `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`) is smaller than 2 in height or width, it returns -1, indicating that a valid frame cannot be formed.
3. Finally, it modifies the `result` screen to add the frame by replacing the appropriate pixels with '+'.

Let's evaluate potential edge cases:

1. **Single White Pixel:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     1 1
     w
     ```
   - The output should be:
     ```
     w
     ```
   - The current implementation would return -1 because the frame cannot exist around this single pixel.

2. **White Pixels Forming a Line:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5 5
     .....
     ..w..
     ..w..
     ..w..
     .....
     ```
   - The output should be:
     ```
     .....
     +w+..
     +w+..
     +w+..
     .....
     ```
   - However, since the implementation checks height and width >= 2, it would return -1 incorrectly.

3. **Adjacent White Pixels:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     2 5
     .w...
     .w...
     ```
   - The output should be:
     ```
     .w...
     +w...
     ```
   - The implementation would fail to find a proper frame since the calculated frame height and width would not allow for a border.

The program fails to account for the situation where a valid frame could be formed, but the dimensions being less than two in any direction leads it to incorrectly return -1.

Given the above analysis and counterexamples that showcase the program's failure in diverse scenarios, I conclude that the program does not meet the problem requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
