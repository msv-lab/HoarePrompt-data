Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case when the bounding box formed by the white pixels ('w') is less than 2 in either dimension. Specifically, the requirement states that the frame must have a width and height of at least 1 pixel, meaning that if there's only a single 'w' pixel, it cannot form a frame around itself, and the program should return -1. The current implementation only checks if the frame height and width are less than 2, which incorrectly allows frames of size 1x1 (just a single 'w' pixel) to be considered valid unless there are no 'w' characters at all. 

Additionally, the function does not check for non-standard characters in the input and might misbehave if the input includes any unexpected character besides '.' or 'w'. The problem statement guarantees that there will be at least one 'w' character; however, the robustness of the program could be enhanced by explicitly checking for unexpected characters to ensure it meets the specifications for every potential case.

For example:
- If the input consists of a 2x2 grid with pixels like this:
  ```
  ww
  ww
  ```
  The result should be a frame surrounding the whole grid, but currently, it would not correctly handle all cases where the expected frame size is not valid according to the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not fully comply with the provided problem description for every potential case.
