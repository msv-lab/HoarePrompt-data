To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to evaluate whether the program meets the specified requirements for rendering a minimal square frame around the "w" (white pixels) on the screen, given the constraints.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the resolution of the monitor and the current pixel states, storing them appropriately. This aligns with the problem description as it ensures that `n`, `m`, and the `screen` list contain the correct input data.

2. **Finding the Bounding Box**:
   - The program iterates through the `screen` to determine the positions of all 'w' pixels. 
   - It calculates the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that encapsulates all 'w' pixels by updating `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` accordingly. This step is essential for defining the frame area.
   - The program correctly initializes these variables and updates them during the iteration, which is crucial for determining the limits of the frame.

3. **Valid Frame Dimensions**:
   - After determining the bounding box, the program checks if `frame_height` and `frame_width` are both at least 2. If not, it returns -1.
   - This check is necessary since the problem requires a frame of at least 1 pixel in width but also establishes a frame that does not go beyond the pixels of 'w'. If the frame can't be formed (for example, if all 'w' pixels are adjacent or the frame dimensions are smaller than 2), the program needs to output -1, which it does correctly.

4. **Constructing the Frame**:
   - The program initializes a new `result` list to hold the modified screen.
   - It replaces the pixels at the boundaries defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` with '+', unless they were 'w', in which case they remain unchanged.
   - This is consistent with the problem requirement that the output must show the frame alongside the existing 'w' pixels.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it outputs the modified `result`. If no frame can be created (when conditions aren't met), it prints -1, adhering to the output requirements of the problem.

### Case Analysis
- **Minimal Cases**: The existing checks ensure that if only a single 'w' pixel exists, the program would return -1, which is correct as a frame cannot be formed.
- **Multiple 'w' Pixels**: In cases where multiple 'w' pixels exist and form a box, the program properly calculates and displays the necessary frame with '+' characters around 'w'.
- **Invalid States**: There is an inherent check that if there are no 'w' pixels detected, it returns -1, which is also handled appropriately.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements all the necessary features of the problem statement. Each requirement mentioned is satisfied, from identifying the bounding box around the white pixels, to ensuring a valid frame size, to accurately updating and outputting the screen state.

Given this analysis, the program correctly fulfills the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
