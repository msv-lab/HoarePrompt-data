The initial state specifies conditions about `n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, `left`, `top`, and `bottom`. However, the code provided only impacts the `right` variable, which is assigned the value of `j`. 

The value of `j` is specifically stated to be equal to `k + 1` in the initial state. Therefore, `right` is assigned the value `k + 1`.

Other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, and `bottom`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is equal to `k + 1`, `left` is equal to `k + 1`, and `right` is equal to `k + 1`.**
