Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `screen` is a list of strings. If `top` is None, then `top` is equal to `bottom`, and both are set to `i`, while `left` is equal to `right`, and both are set to `j`, with `i` equal to `n` and `j` equal to 0. Otherwise, `top` equals `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 0. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', maintaining the conditions that if `i` is less than `top`, it remains so, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, it could potentially be out of range, if `j` is less than `left`, it remains so, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then the value of `j` exceeds `right`.***
