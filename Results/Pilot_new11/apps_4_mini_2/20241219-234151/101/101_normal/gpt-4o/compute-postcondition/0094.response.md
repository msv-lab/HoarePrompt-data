Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000. `screen` is a list of strings, and `j` is equal to `m`. If `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, and `left` are set to `i`, and both `right` is equal to `m`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is set to `m`.***
