Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `m` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a list of lists of characters. If `result[i][j]` was a period ('.'), it is now updated to '+', while `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, and `i` is either `bottom + 1`, or is equal to `top` or `bottom`; also, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and the value of `j` is either equal to `left` or `right`.***
