Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `screen` is a list of strings. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then if `top` is None, both `top` and `bottom` are set to `i`, and `left` is set to `j`, otherwise, `top` is `n`, `bottom` is `n`, `left` is 0, and `right` is the maximum column index, maintaining the conditions that `i` remains less than `top`, is potentially greater than `bottom`, and `j` is either less than `left` or exceeds `right`.***
