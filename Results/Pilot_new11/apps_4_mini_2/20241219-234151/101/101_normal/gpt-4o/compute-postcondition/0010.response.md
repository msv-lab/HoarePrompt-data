Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `top` is not None. If the current value of `i` is less than `top` (which is equal to 0), the condition is satisfied; otherwise, there is no else part to handle.***
