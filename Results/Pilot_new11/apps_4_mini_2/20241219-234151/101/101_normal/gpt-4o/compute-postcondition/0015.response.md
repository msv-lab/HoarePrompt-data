The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, there are no changes to `bottom`; the current value of `screen[i][j]` remains 'w'; `j` is 0; `top` is not None; `left` is now equal to 0; the current value of `j` is less than `left`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, there are no changes to `bottom`; the current value of `screen[i][j]` remains 'w'; `j` is 0; `top` is not None; `left` is 0; the current value of `j` is less than `left.**
