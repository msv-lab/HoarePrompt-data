According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and the range specified by `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, since the loop is structured as `for j in range(m)`, the variable `j` would have been the maximum value of `m - 1`. Therefore, the next value of `j` would be `m` for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be less than `m`.

To ensure the loop can execute, `j` should be equal to `m`, which means it cannot execute again since `j` cannot exceed `m - 1`. Thus, for the loop context, the next state reflects `j` being `m` and that `screen` is ready to process `m` columns.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `j` is `m`**.
