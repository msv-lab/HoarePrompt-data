The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently equal to `n`. This means that `top` will now hold the value of `n`. The states of other variables remain unchanged, except for `top`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is the maximum row index, `left` is the minimum column index, `right` is the maximum column index, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is less than `top`, now `top` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is equal to `n`, `bottom` is the maximum row index, `left` is the minimum column index, `right` is the maximum column index, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is less than `top`.**
