The code snippet assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial state indicates that `j` is `0`. Therefore, both `left` and `right` will be assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is `i_end + 1`, `bottom` is `i_end + 1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
