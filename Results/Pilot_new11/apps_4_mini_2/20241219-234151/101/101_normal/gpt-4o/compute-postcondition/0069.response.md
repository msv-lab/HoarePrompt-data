Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of strings. If `top` is None, then both `top` and `bottom` are set to `i_end + 1`, `left` and `right` are out of bounds, and `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `top` and `bottom` are based on `i`, `left` and `right` remain out of bounds, `i` is updated to `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1`, `j` is set to 0, and `screen[i][j]` is 'w', with `right` equal to `j` which is 0. If neither condition is met, the variable states remain unchanged.***
