Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of strings. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is updated to the value of `j`, while `bottom`, `top`, `right`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `left`, then `left` remains unchanged, and `bottom`, `top`, `right`, and `j` also remain unchanged.***
