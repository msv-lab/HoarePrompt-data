Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a list of lists of characters. If `result[i][j]` was originally '.', it is now set to '+', and the current value of `i` is either `top` or `bottom`, with `j` set to `left`. The constraints for `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `left`, and `right` remain satisfied.***
