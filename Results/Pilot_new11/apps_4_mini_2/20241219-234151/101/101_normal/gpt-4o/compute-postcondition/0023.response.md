The variables `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged unless specified by the conditions mentioned. Since `top` is assigned 0 and `bottom` is also assigned 0, the pre-existing conditions for `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j` will still apply.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `i` is 0, `j` is 1; `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.**
