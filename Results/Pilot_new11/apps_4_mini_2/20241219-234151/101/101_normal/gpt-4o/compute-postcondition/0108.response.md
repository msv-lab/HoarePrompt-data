The value of `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. Since `bottom` is now set to `n`, it must remain less than or equal to `i`, which means `bottom = n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` equals `n`, `bottom` is now equal to `n`, `left` is the minimum column index, `right` is the maximum column index, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', if `i` is less than `top`, the current value of `i` remains less than `top`, and the current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` equals `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is the minimum column index, `right` is the maximum column index, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', if `i` is less than `top`, the current value of `i` remains less than `top`, and the current value of `i` is greater than `bottom`.**
