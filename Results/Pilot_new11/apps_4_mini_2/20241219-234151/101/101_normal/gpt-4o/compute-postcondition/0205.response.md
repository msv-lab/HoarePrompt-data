The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. The parameters `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of strings where each string consists of exactly `m` characters that are either '.' (indicating a black pixel) or 'w' (indicating a white pixel). 

The function has the following return conditions:
- Case 1: If certain conditions are met, the function returns -1.
- Case 2: If the current value of `frame_height` is less than 2 or the current value of `frame_width` is less than 2, the function returns -1.
- Case 3: The function returns the modified list `result`, in which specific entries are updated based on certain indices.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `m` (both in the range from 1 to 2000) and a list of strings `screen`, and based on specific conditions related to these inputs, it may return -1 or a modified version of the list `result`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `m` (with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) and a list of strings `screen`. It may return -1 based on certain conditions or a modified list `result` based on specific indices.**
