The variables `left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is initialized to 1, both `left` and `right` will take on the value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `j` is 1**
