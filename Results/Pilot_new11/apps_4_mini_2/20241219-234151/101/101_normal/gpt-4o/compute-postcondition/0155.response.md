According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the values of `top` and `bottom`. The loop will execute as long as `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`. Therefore, for the loop to initiate, we must ensure that the following conditions hold:

1. `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`. Since it's stated that `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, this implies that there can be a range defined by `top` and `bottom`.
2. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to `top`.

Since `top` and `bottom` must be defined in a way that supports this comparison, if `top` equals `bottom`, the loop will execute exactly once. Thus, we need to ensure that `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`.

State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `m` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `result` is a list of lists of characters derived from `screen`, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `i` is `top` at the start of the loop, and `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.**
