Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `i` is 0; if `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, and `left` are initialized to 0, 0, and 1 respectively, while `right` is set to 1; otherwise, if `top` is not None, `bottom` remains unchanged, `left` remains 1, and `top` is updated to 0 if `j` > `right` and `i` is less than `top`; otherwise, `top` remains unchanged.***
