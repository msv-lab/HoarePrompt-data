Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000. If `j` is less than `left` (where `left` is 0), then if `i` is greater than `bottom`, `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, there are no changes to `bottom`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` remains 'w'; `j` is currently 0; `top` is not None; and `j` is greater than `right` (where `right` must be less than or equal to 0).***
