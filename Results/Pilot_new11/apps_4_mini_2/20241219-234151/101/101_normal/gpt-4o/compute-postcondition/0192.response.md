Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a modified list of lists of characters, where if `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is set to '+'. The indices `i` and `j` are constrained by `i` equal to `bottom + 1`, `top` less than or equal to `bottom + 1`, and `left` less than or equal to `right`, with `i` equal to either `top` or `bottom`, or `j` equal to `left` or `right`. In the case where `result[i][j]` is not '.', the state remains unchanged.***
