Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a list of lists of characters. If `result[i][j]` was previously a dot ('.'), it is now updated to '+'. The values of `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, and `j` is still equal to `left + 1` or values less than `right.***
