Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of strings. If `top` is None, then `top` and `bottom` are set to the value of `i`, `left` is set to 1, `right` is set to 1, and `j` remains 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is assigned the value of `j`, while `left` remains unchanged; if `j` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` remains unchanged.***
