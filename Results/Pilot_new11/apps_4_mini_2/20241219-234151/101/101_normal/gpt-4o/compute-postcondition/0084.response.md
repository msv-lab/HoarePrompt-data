The variables `top`, `bottom`, and `i` are assigned the same value, which is the current value of `i`. The initial conditions state `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `m` is also an integer between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `j` is equal to `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `screen` remain unchanged, while `top`, `bottom`, and `i` are now equal.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is `m`, `top` is equal to `bottom` which is equal to `i`.**
