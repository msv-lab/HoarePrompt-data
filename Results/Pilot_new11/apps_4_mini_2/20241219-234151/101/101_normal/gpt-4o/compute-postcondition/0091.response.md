Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `j` is equal to `m`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is set to `m`. Additionally, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is set to `i`, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`.***
