Postcondition: ***`n` is at least `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` equals `n`, `bottom` is equal to `n`, `left` is the minimum column index, `right` is the maximum column index, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', if `i` is less than `top`, the current value of `i` remains less than `top`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` could potentially be out of the range defined by `top` and `bottom` while maintaining its initial value as `n`, and the current value of `j` is less than `left`.***
