The code snippet calculates the `frame_height` as the difference between the `bottom` and `top` indices, adjusting for inclusive indexing by adding 1. 

The impact of the code on the program is that `frame_height` will now hold the value derived from the existing `top` and `bottom` values.

Since `top` is the minimum row index and `bottom` is the maximum row index of the 'w' characters, `frame_height` will be computed directly from these values. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged; `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`.**
