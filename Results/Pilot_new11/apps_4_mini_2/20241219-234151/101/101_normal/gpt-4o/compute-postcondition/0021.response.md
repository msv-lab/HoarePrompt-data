Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and if `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then if `top` is None, it implies that all variables are initialized as top, bottom, left, and right values being 0. If `top` is not None and `j` is currently 0, `left` is 0, and `j` is not greater than `right`, then the bottom remains unchanged as that condition does not apply. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged, as there is no else part in the code.***
