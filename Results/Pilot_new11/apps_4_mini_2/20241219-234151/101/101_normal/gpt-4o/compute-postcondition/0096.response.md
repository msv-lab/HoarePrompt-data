Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000. `screen` is a list of strings. `top` and `bottom` contain the minimum and maximum row indices, respectively, of 'w' characters encountered, if any; otherwise, both remain None. `left` and `right` contain the minimum and maximum column indices, respectively, of 'w' characters encountered, if any; otherwise, both remain out of bounds. If no 'w' characters are present in the entire `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will continue to have their initial states (None and out of bounds).**
