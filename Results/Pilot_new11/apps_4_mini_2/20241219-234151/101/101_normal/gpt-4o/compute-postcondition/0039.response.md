Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`. If `top` is None, `top`, `bottom`, and `left` are initialized to 0, 0, and 1 respectively, while `right` is set to 1; otherwise, if `top` is not None and `i` is less than `top`, `bottom` remains unchanged and `left` remains 1, and `top` is updated to `i`.***
