The variable `top` is assigned the value of `bottom`, which is initially equal to `i`. Therefore, `top` and `bottom` both now hold the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, including `left`, `right`, `n`, `m`, `screen`, and the conditionals regarding `top` and `bottom`. 

The Output State will reflect `top` and `bottom` being equal to `i` while the others remain as stated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` remains 1, `right` remains 1.**
