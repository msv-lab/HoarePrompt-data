Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the situation where the square frame doesn't fit entirely within the boundaries of the screen or includes any black pixels when trying to create the frame around the white pixels. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
....w
..... 
....w
```

In this case, the pixels containing 'w' are located at (0, 4) and (2, 4). The minimum frame that should enclose these white pixels would be at least from (0, 4) to (2, 4), which would require a frame height of 3 and width of 1. However, there should be a check for whether the frame can be drawn without extending beyond existing black pixels or beyond the array boundaries.

Specifically, when the program checks to see if `frame_size > max(n, m)`, it may incorrectly conclude that a frame can be drawn when, logically, it can't. It does not account for the fact that a valid frame must be drawn around the extents of the 'w' pixels, meaning it must be within bounds formed by two 'w' pixels in the same column with no intervening black pixels.

Thus, the output of the program would incorrectly produce a frame in this case, leading to an incorrect result. In summary, the case shows that the logic for determining where to place the frame fails when there are multiple 'w' pixels placed vertically but no available black pixels directly adjacent. This leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
