You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the provided code.

1. **Extracting White Pixels:** The program correctly identifies the coordinates of all white pixels represented by 'w' in the pixel grid.

2. **Determining the Frame Bounds:** The program calculates the minimum and maximum x (row) and y (column) coordinates of the white pixels, which determines the extents of the square frame.

3. **Frame Size Calculation:** The frame size is calculated as the greater of the width and height required to encapsulate the white pixels, plus one. 

4. **Frame Validity Check:** The program checks if the calculated frame size exceeds the screen dimensions. If so, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it can't fit a frame.

5. **Frame Construction:** The program then constructs the frame by replacing the corresponding pixels in the original grid with '+' for the frame's border while keeping 'w' pixels intact.

### Potential Issue:
If there are cases where the white pixels are isolated or positioned such that a compact frame cannot be built without violating the one-pixel requirement, the existing code fails to properly exemplify all edge cases. 

**For example:**
- Consider a case where white pixels are located in such a way that the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates do not form a perfect rectangle (i.e., an L-shape). This could lead to the frame not surrounding all white pixels properly despite all bounds being calculated.

**Test Case Example:**
```plaintext
3 5
....w
..w..
.w...
```
- In this case, the `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` would define a grid larger than a single square, and the program may incorrectly apply the '+' based solely on the bounds without accounting for isolated white pixels.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle cases where the required frame to encapsulate the 'w' pixels cannot be drawn as stated (all 'w' pixels must be on the border of the frame). The computations do not guarantee successful framing in all configurations of white pixels.

Therefore, the correctness assessment is:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and the following n lines contain exactly m characters each, with characters being either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), where at least one character is 'w'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`.
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` remains a list containing at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged; `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; `pixels` may contain '+' at positions meeting the specified conditions, and unchanged 'w' pixels will remain 'w', while other pixels will be set to '.' if they were not specified to be '+' through the loop conditions. The loop will execute 'n' times, and for each row, all 'm' columns will be processed. If no conditions are met to change any pixels, the pixels array will retain any original setup except for 'w' pixels, which remain unchanged.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To understand the state after all iterations of the loop, let’s analyze the provided information clearly. The loop iterates through `pixels`, which is a 2D list containing `n` rows and `m` columns. Each iteration prints a string that represents the contents of the current `row`. 
        #
        #Given that `n` and `m` are integers within the range [1, 2000], and `white_pixels` is guaranteed to contain at least one tuple, it's ensured that the outer loop iterates based on the number of rows in `pixels`, which is `n` times. The properties regarding `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged during these iterations.
        #
        #After `n` iterations of this loop, the state can be detailed as follows: 
        #1. The loop will print the contents of the 2D list `pixels`, which contains `n` rows with the width of `m` columns.
        #2. Each row's output corresponds to its original state before entering the loop, possibly influenced by modifications made due to conditions regarding `white_pixels`.
        #
        #Considering the conditions, at the end of the loop, `pixels` still has `n` rows and `m` columns, and the unchanged conditions regarding `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` hold true.
        #
        #Thus, summarizing the above conditions:
        #
        #Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` is a list containing at least one tuple (x, y), `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.`
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple (x, y), `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged, and `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than `max(n, m)`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, retaining its original state, and the iteration will print the contents of each row of `pixels` accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer pair (n, m) indicating the dimensions of a grid, followed by n lines of m characters each, representing pixels that can be either black ('.') or white ('w'). It identifies the coordinates of all white pixels ('w') and computes the minimum and maximum coordinates of these pixels. Based on the computed coordinates, it checks whether the size of the bounding frame around the white pixels exceeds the grid dimensions. If it does, the function outputs -1. If not, it modifies the grid, marking the edges of the frame (if they contain black pixels) with a '+' sign while leaving white pixels unchanged and any other black pixels as dots. Finally, it prints the modified grid. 

Edge cases include: 
1. The case where the entire grid is composed only of white pixels (which may require handling to ensure that the edges get modified appropriately).
2. A scenario where white pixels are positioned at the edges of the grid so that nothing is modified.
3. Situations where the size of the frame around white pixels is equal to the grid dimensions, ensuring that the '+' marking conditions operate correctly.
4. The function guarantees that there is at least one white pixel, but does not explicitly handle when all other pixels, apart from the white ones, remain untouched if they are adjacent to the bounding frame. 

The final state includes the original grid modified according to the conditions, or -1 is printed if the bounding frame exceeds the grid's size. The function prints each row of the modified or unmodified grid at the end.
