You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the situation where the square frame doesn't fit entirely within the boundaries of the screen or includes any black pixels when trying to create the frame around the white pixels. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
....w
..... 
....w
```

In this case, the pixels containing 'w' are located at (0, 4) and (2, 4). The minimum frame that should enclose these white pixels would be at least from (0, 4) to (2, 4), which would require a frame height of 3 and width of 1. However, there should be a check for whether the frame can be drawn without extending beyond existing black pixels or beyond the array boundaries.

Specifically, when the program checks to see if `frame_size > max(n, m)`, it may incorrectly conclude that a frame can be drawn when, logically, it can't. It does not account for the fact that a valid frame must be drawn around the extents of the 'w' pixels, meaning it must be within bounds formed by two 'w' pixels in the same column with no intervening black pixels.

Thus, the output of the program would incorrectly produce a frame in this case, leading to an incorrect result. In summary, the case shows that the logic for determining where to place the frame fails when there are multiple 'w' pixels placed vertically but no available black pixels directly adjacent. This leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer pair (n, m) indicating the dimensions of a grid, followed by n lines of m characters each, representing pixels that can be either black ('.') or white ('w'). It identifies the coordinates of all white pixels ('w') and computes the minimum and maximum coordinates of these pixels. Based on the computed coordinates, it checks whether the size of the bounding frame around the white pixels exceeds the grid dimensions. If it does, the function outputs -1. If not, it modifies the grid, marking the edges of the frame (if they contain black pixels) with a '+' sign while leaving white pixels unchanged and any other black pixels as dots. Finally, it prints the modified grid. 

Edge cases include: 
1. The case where the entire grid is composed only of white pixels (which may require handling to ensure that the edges get modified appropriately).
2. A scenario where white pixels are positioned at the edges of the grid so that nothing is modified.
3. Situations where the size of the frame around white pixels is equal to the grid dimensions, ensuring that the '+' marking conditions operate correctly.
4. The function guarantees that there is at least one white pixel, but does not explicitly handle when all other pixels, apart from the white ones, remain untouched if they are adjacent to the bounding frame. 

The final state includes the original grid modified according to the conditions, or -1 is printed if the bounding frame exceeds the grid's size. The function prints each row of the modified or unmodified grid at the end.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
