According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `j`, which controls the number of iterations based on `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. If the loop is currently at its last iteration, which means `j` is equal to `m - 1`, it cannot execute again.

Therefore, if the loop is to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1. If `j` is currently at `m - 1`, it will be updated to `m`, and the loop will no longer execute, thus needing the condition to be **`j < m`**. 

Assuming `j` is at its last valid index before the next increment, the conditions for the loop to run one more time must reflect `j` being incremented.

State: **`n, m, i, j is m, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y` remain unchanged. `j must be less than m`**
