The `continue` statement is used in looping constructs, which causes the loop to skip the remaining code for the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since the initial state indicates that `i`, `j`, and `pixels` (though unspecified how they relate to the loop itself) remain unchanged, it is important to note that none of the variable values are altered directly by the `continue` statement itself. 

Given that the initial state remains valid and the loop does not terminate, the only effect we have here is a reiteration of the loop without modification to any variable. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop is still ongoing and no state change has occurred.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels` remains unchanged; the loop continues without modification of these variables.**
