To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, letâ€™s break down the effect of the code on the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state specifies that `min_x` is equal to `x` and `min_y` is equal to `y`. 
2. The line of code `min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)` calculates the minimum values for `min_x` and `min_y`. 
3. The values of `min_x` and `min_y` are updated based on the minimum of their current values and the values of `x` and `y`.

Given that the code uses the `min` function, we can express the new values of `min_x` and `min_y` as follows:
- Since `min_x` is initially equal to `x`, and `x` is equal to `white_pixels[1][0]`, the calculation for `min_x` will compare `x` with itself (effectively leaving `min_x` unchanged if `x` is equal to or greater than the original `min_x`).
- The same reasoning applies to `min_y`, which is initially equal to `y`, defined as `white_pixels[1][1]`.

However, without knowing the actual numeric values of `min_x`, `x`, `min_y`, and `y`, we can't determine specific numerical results. 

Thus, the variables that change due to the execution of the code are:
- `min_x` could either remain the same or change to the value of `x` if `x` is less than the current `min_x`.
- `min_y` could either remain the same or change to the value of `y` if `y` is less than the current `min_y`.

Keeping this in mind, we can conclude that the output state will depend on those comparisons but generally can be summarized as follows.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least 2 tuples of (x, y); `min_x` is the minimum of its previous value and `x`; `min_y` is the minimum of its previous value and `y`; `max_x` is equal to `x`; `max_y` is equal to `y`; `x` is the first element of `white_pixels[1][0]`; `y` is the first element of `white_pixels[1][1]`.**
