Postcondition: ***`n, m, i, j, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y` remain unchanged. If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and if `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is set to '+'. If these conditions are not met but `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', no modifications are made to `pixels`. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.'***
