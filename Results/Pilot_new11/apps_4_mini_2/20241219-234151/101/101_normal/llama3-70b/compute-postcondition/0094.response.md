The statement that is executed is `print(''.join(row))`, which outputs the string created by joining the elements of `row`. However, since the content of `row` is printed and not assigned or modified, the `row` remains unchanged in terms of its definition and contents. The output of this code does not change any variable but results in the string representation of the current contents of `row` being printed. Other variables including `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` is a list containing at least one tuple (x, y), `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` unchanged, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and the contents of `row` have been printed as a string.**
