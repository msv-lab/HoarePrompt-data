According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `pixels` 2D list. The loop processes each `row` of the `pixels` list. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is the string representation of the current row being processed in the loop. Given that `pixels` has `n` rows, for the loop to execute one more time, the next `row` must be the next row in the list. 

Since there are `n` rows and the new value of `row` should point to the next row, if `row` currently corresponds to the last row (i.e., the nth row), the loop cannot execute again. However, it is understood that `row` in this case is iterating through the current rows numerically (from 0 to n-1). 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions state that `pixels` must still have `n` rows to access, and the current index (implicitly tracked by the iteration) needs to move to the next row, which suggests that if there are still rows left, it would now be one index further.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` is a list containing at least one tuple (x, y), `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` unchanged, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `'row'` contents are printed as a string that corresponds to the next row in the list**.
