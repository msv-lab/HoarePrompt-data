Postcondition: ***If `pixels[i][j]` is '+', then the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `j_last`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are such that `m` is greater than `j_last + 1`. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the values remain unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is unchanged, `m` is still greater than `j_last + 1`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is set to `j_last + 1`, and the values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` remain unchanged with `pixels[i][j]` being '.'***
