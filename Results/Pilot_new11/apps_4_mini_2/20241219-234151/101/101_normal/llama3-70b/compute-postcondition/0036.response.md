The code updates the element at position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` array or matrix to the character `'+'`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `j` do not change as a result of this code. Given that `j` is 2 and there is no indication that either `i` or the `pixels` structure has any specific constraints mentioned, we do not alter any of their values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000], `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `pixels[i][j]` is set to '+'**.
