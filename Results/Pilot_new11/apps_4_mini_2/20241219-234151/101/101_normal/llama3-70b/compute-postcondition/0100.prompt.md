You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and the following n lines contain exactly m characters each, with characters being either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), where at least one character is 'w'.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] ==
    'w']
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float(
    '-inf')
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
        
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`; `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`.
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j
                    ] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` remains a list containing at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged; `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; `pixels` may contain '+' at positions meeting the specified conditions, and unchanged 'w' pixels will remain 'w', while other pixels will be set to '.' if they were not specified to be '+' through the loop conditions. The loop will execute 'n' times, and for each row, all 'm' columns will be processed. If no conditions are met to change any pixels, the pixels array will retain any original setup except for 'w' pixels, which remain unchanged.
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To understand the state after all iterations of the loop, let’s analyze the provided information clearly. The loop iterates through `pixels`, which is a 2D list containing `n` rows and `m` columns. Each iteration prints a string that represents the contents of the current `row`. 
        #
        #Given that `n` and `m` are integers within the range [1, 2000], and `white_pixels` is guaranteed to contain at least one tuple, it's ensured that the outer loop iterates based on the number of rows in `pixels`, which is `n` times. The properties regarding `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged during these iterations.
        #
        #After `n` iterations of this loop, the state can be detailed as follows: 
        #1. The loop will print the contents of the 2D list `pixels`, which contains `n` rows with the width of `m` columns.
        #2. Each row's output corresponds to its original state before entering the loop, possibly influenced by modifications made due to conditions regarding `white_pixels`.
        #
        #Considering the conditions, at the end of the loop, `pixels` still has `n` rows and `m` columns, and the unchanged conditions regarding `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` hold true.
        #
        #Thus, summarizing the above conditions:
        #
        #Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` is a list containing at least one tuple (x, y), `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.`
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple (x, y), `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged, and `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than `max(n, m)`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, retaining its original state, and the iteration will print the contents of each row of `pixels` accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `n` lines of `m` characters, where each character is either a black pixel ('.') or a white pixel ('w'), and returns a result based on the arrangement of these pixels, ensuring at least one white pixel is present.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
