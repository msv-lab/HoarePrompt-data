The statement `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the specific position in the 2D list `pixels` at the coordinates `(i, j)`. The variables `n, m, i, j` are affected through the assignment of `pixels` and the values previously assigned to `i` and `j` are unchanged (but depend on the context which is not provided).

Based on the initial state provided: `n, m, i, j is j_last + 1, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y` and the condition that `m` is greater than `j_last + 1`, we can conclude:
- `i` is `j_last + 1`
- `j` is unspecified but since `m > j_last + 1`, `j` should be less than `m`.

Therefore, the variable `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`, but we don't know the specific values of `n, m, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y`.

Output State: **`n, m, i is j_last + 1, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y; pixels[i][j] is '+'`**
