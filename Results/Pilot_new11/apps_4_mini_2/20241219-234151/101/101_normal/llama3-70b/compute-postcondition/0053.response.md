According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. Since `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 to become 1. 

Given that the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the impact of the condition on `pixels[i][j]` does not affect the iteration logic but rather what happens during the loop, we focus solely on the progression of `j`.

Therefore, after the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be 1. The loop can still execute again as long as it continues to stay within the range of `m`.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged,  `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels` remains impacted as necessary.**
