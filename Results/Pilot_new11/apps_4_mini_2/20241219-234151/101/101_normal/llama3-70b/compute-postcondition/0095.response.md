According to the code, the loop iterates over each `row` in the `pixels` 2D list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more rows to iterate through in the `pixels` list. 

At the end of the last iteration, there is a `row` which comes from the `pixels` 2D list. Since `pixels` has `n` rows, and assuming the loop has gone through `k` iterations until this point (where `k < n`), the index for the next row will be `k + 1`. 

Thus, to execute one more time, we need:
1. `row` will need to be the next row in `pixels`, which will be at index `k + 1`.
2. `pixels` should have at least `k + 1` rows, meaning at least `k + 2` rows in total for the next iteration of the loop to be valid.

As such, if `n` is the current number of rows (which is at least `k + 1`), it needs to ensure `n` is at least `k + 2`. The current settings give us that, `row` will represent `pixels[k + 1]`.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` is a list containing at least one tuple (x, y), `pixels` is a 2D list with at least `k + 2` rows and `m` columns, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` unchanged, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `row` is the row at index `k + 1` printed as a string.**
