From the given initial state, we know that `j` is equal to `j_last + 1`, and `m` is greater than `j_last + 1`. 

The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` assigns the value `'.'` to the specific position `pixels[i][j]` in a 2D array called `pixels`, where `i` and `j` are indices. 

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment, but it can be noted that `j`'s value directly dictates which column in the `pixels` array is being modified.

Since the only action taking place is the assignment in the `pixels` array, we deduce that:

- `pixels[i][j]` is now `'.'`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` do not change in this operation.

Output State: **`n` remains as is, `m` is greater than `j_last + 1, `i` remains as is, `j` is `j_last + 1`, `min_x` remains as is, `min_y` remains as is, `max_x` remains as is, `max_y` remains as is, `pixels[i][j]` is '.'**
