The code assigns the value '.' to the element at the index `[1][1]` in the `pixels` array (or list) based on the current values of `i` and `j`, which are both `1`. Therefore, `pixels[1][1]` is updated to '.'. The other variables, `n`, `m`, and `pixels`, remain unchanged in terms of their overall structure, but the specific element within the `pixels` structure is impacted.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `pixels[1][1]` is '.'**
