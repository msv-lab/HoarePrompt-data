The code assigns the values of `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum of their previous values and the current values of `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` is taken as `white_pixels[1][0]` and `y` as `white_pixels[1][1]`, the values of `max_x` and `max_y` will be updated accordingly, based on the comparisons. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as they haven't been modified in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least 2 tuples of (x, y); `min_x` is the minimum of its previous value and `x`; `min_y` is the minimum of its previous value and `y`; `max_x` is the maximum of its previous value and `white_pixels[1][0]`; `max_y` is the maximum of its previous value and `white_pixels[1][1]`; `x` is the first element of `white_pixels[1][0]`; `y` is the first element of `white_pixels[1][1]`.**
