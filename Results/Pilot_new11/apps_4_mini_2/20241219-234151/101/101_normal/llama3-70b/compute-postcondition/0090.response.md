Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` remains a list containing at least one tuple of (x, y); `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged; `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; `pixels` may contain '+' at positions meeting the specified conditions, and unchanged 'w' pixels will remain 'w', while other pixels will be set to '.' if they were not specified to be '+' through the loop conditions. The loop will execute 'n' times, and for each row, all 'm' columns will be processed. If no conditions are met to change any pixels, the pixels array will retain any original setup except for 'w' pixels, which remain unchanged.**
