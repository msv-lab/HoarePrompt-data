According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop is able to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Since the provided state mentions that `frame_size` must be less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, we can affirm that this condition has not been violated.

Thus, for the loop execution to proceed correctly, the `i` variable should start at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple of (x, y), `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `i` is 0**.
