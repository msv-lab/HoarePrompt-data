According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `white_pixels`. For the loop to execute, `white_pixels` must not be empty, meaning it should contain at least one tuple (x, y). Furthermore, since the loop iterates over `white_pixels`, the values of `x` and `y` will correspond to the first tuple in the list during the first iteration. 

At the start of the loop, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are initialized to extreme values. These values indicate that they will be updated during the execution of the loop based on the contents of `white_pixels`. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to confirm the state of `white_pixels`, and we should initialize `x` and `y` to the first element of the list.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must not be empty and should contain tuples of (x, y); `min_x` is float('inf'), `min_y` is float('inf'), `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf'); `x` is the first element of `white_pixels`[0][0], `y` is the first element of `white_pixels`[0][1]**.
