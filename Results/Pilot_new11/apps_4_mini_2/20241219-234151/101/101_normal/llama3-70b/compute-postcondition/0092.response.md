The code `print(''.join(row))` outputs the joined string of a specific `row` from the `pixels` 2D list. Since `row` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, we cannot determine its specific contents or index. The values of other variables remain unchanged; hence the output reflects the printing process as a side effect without changing the state of any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` is a list containing at least one tuple (x, y), `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` unchanged, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `'row'` contents are printed as a string.**
