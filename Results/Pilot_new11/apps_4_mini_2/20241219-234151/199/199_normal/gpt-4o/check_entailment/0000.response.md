To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided Python function for counting the ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The cuts must form four parts of positive integer lengths.
2. The sum of the lengths must equal `n`.
3. It should be possible to form a rectangle from these parts.
4. It must be impossible to form a square from these parts.

### Program Analysis:
- The function begins by checking if `n < 6`. If true, it returns 0 since it's impossible to make four positive parts from lengths shorter than 6.
- The loop iterates `a` from 1 to `n // 4`. For each `a`, it considers `b` equal to `a` (making pairs initially).
- It calculates the remaining length after accounting for two parts of length `a` and `b`. If the remaining length (`rem`) is greater than 0 and even, it divides it by 2 to find the length of the other two parts.
- Finally, it checks if the other two parts (length `rem // 2`) are different from `a`. If so, it increments the count.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Limitations in Counting Distinct Combinations**: The current algorithm counts distinct combinations incorrectly. For example, when `n = 14`, the combinations would be `{1,1,6,6}`, `{2,2,5,5}`, `{3,3,4,4}`. The algorithm may not capture all distinct pairs and could miss valid combinations.
2. **Condition for Non-Squares**: The function only checks that `rem // 2` is different from `a`. However, it doesn't check whether `rem // 2` can equal `a`, which would form a square (e.g., the configuration `{a, a, a, a}` is invalid but not properly prevented).

### Counterexample:
Letâ€™s use the input `n = 12`:
- For `n = 12`, valid combinations would be:
  - `{1, 1, 5, 5}`
  - `{2, 2, 4, 4}`
  - But `{3, 3, 3, 3}` is not allowed.
  
According to the expected logic, the implementation doesn't effectively handle cases, and it might incorrectly count the ways.

Given the analysis above, the algorithm does not cover every situation properly, particularly in its counting logic and conditions for forming a square.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly calculate the distinct ways to arrange the segments for the input cases defined and has logical flaws in its implementation regarding the avoidance of squares.
