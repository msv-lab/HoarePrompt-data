You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided Python function for counting the ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The cuts must form four parts of positive integer lengths.
2. The sum of the lengths must equal `n`.
3. It should be possible to form a rectangle from these parts.
4. It must be impossible to form a square from these parts.

### Program Analysis:
- The function begins by checking if `n < 6`. If true, it returns 0 since it's impossible to make four positive parts from lengths shorter than 6.
- The loop iterates `a` from 1 to `n // 4`. For each `a`, it considers `b` equal to `a` (making pairs initially).
- It calculates the remaining length after accounting for two parts of length `a` and `b`. If the remaining length (`rem`) is greater than 0 and even, it divides it by 2 to find the length of the other two parts.
- Finally, it checks if the other two parts (length `rem // 2`) are different from `a`. If so, it increments the count.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Limitations in Counting Distinct Combinations**: The current algorithm counts distinct combinations incorrectly. For example, when `n = 14`, the combinations would be `{1,1,6,6}`, `{2,2,5,5}`, `{3,3,4,4}`. The algorithm may not capture all distinct pairs and could miss valid combinations.
2. **Condition for Non-Squares**: The function only checks that `rem // 2` is different from `a`. However, it doesn't check whether `rem // 2` can equal `a`, which would form a square (e.g., the configuration `{a, a, a, a}` is invalid but not properly prevented).

### Counterexample:
Let’s use the input `n = 12`:
- For `n = 12`, valid combinations would be:
  - `{1, 1, 5, 5}`
  - `{2, 2, 4, 4}`
  - But `{3, 3, 3, 3}` is not allowed.
  
According to the expected logic, the implementation doesn't effectively handle cases, and it might incorrectly count the ways.

Given the analysis above, the algorithm does not cover every situation properly, particularly in its counting logic and conditions for forming a square.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly calculate the distinct ways to arrange the segments for the input cases defined and has logical flaws in its implementation regarding the avoidance of squares.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9`. It returns `0` if `n` is less than `6`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `6`, it computes and returns the total number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `a` takes values from `1` to `n // 4`, `b` is equal to `a`, and the remainder `rem`, calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`, is even and positive. The function counts valid pairs where `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If no valid pairs exist or the conditions are not met, the count will be `0`. For values of `n` from `1` to `5`, the function returns `0`, covering crucial edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
