The provided program aims to count the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. Upon analyzing the code:

1. The function starts by checking if `n` is less than `6`. If so, it correctly returns `0` since it's impossible to create four positive integer lengths that sum up to `n`.
2. For valid values of `n` (i.e., `n >= 6`), it iterates over potential values for `a` (where `a` represents the lengths of two parts of the rectangle) from `1` to `n // 4`.
3. It calculates `b` as equal to `a` and computes the remainder `rem` that needs to be split among the two remaining parts.
4. The code checks if this remainder is positive and even, which is necessary for the lengths of the remaining parts to also be equal, and that `a` does not equal to half of the remainder, ensuring that forming a square isn't possible.

Going through the provided examples:
- For `n = 6`, the valid partition is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, thus the output `1` is correct.
- For `n = 20`, valid partitions include `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`, which correctly count to `4`.

However, there might be an oversight in edge cases:
- When `n` is just below a multiple of `4`, like `n = 11`, since the loop iterates from `1` to `n // 4`, it may create pairs that do not respect the conditions laid out in the problem. The output does not explicitly return the correct count in some cases, like when `n` is odd, and there may be instances where valid pairs that can create a rectangle but not a square are missed.
- The function doesn't appear to count all potential cases thoroughly because of how `a` and `rem` are calculated and validated.

Therefore, I believe the program fails to count all distinct ways to cut the stick into four parts properly, particularly when `n` does not allow for easy even splits toward squares and rectangles.

Correctness: **False**.
