You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided Python program correctly counts the ways to split the stick according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the function `func_1`.

The program implementation checks:

1. If `n` is less than 6, it returns 0 since it's impossible to split it into four positive lengths that would also satisfy the rectangle condition.
2. It iterates with `a` from 1 to `n // 4`. For each `a`, it sets `b` to `a` (first two lengths) and calculates the remaining length `rem`.
3. It checks if this `rem` can be divided by 2 and if its half is different from `a`.

The issue arises because the model does not account for all valid combinations that satisfy the rectangle condition without forming a square. By fixing `b` to `a`, it ignores scenarios where `b` could have values greater than `a`, which may lead to missing valid pairs.

Let's consider the edge case, `n = 8`. According to our understanding, the pairs could be:

- (1, 1, 3, 3): This works.
- (2, 2, 2, 2): This does NOT work because it creates a square.
- (1, 1, 2, 4): This does NOT work because it cannot form a rectangle.
- (1, 1, 1, 5): This does NOT work.
- (1, 2, 2, 3): This does NOT work because it cannot form a rectangle.
  
On manual checking, we find that only (1, 1, 3, 3) is valid. However, the function may not compute this correctly because it’s limited in its logic for how it allows `b` to be set.

By further checking pairs for `n = 10`:
- (1, 1, 4, 4): Valid rectangle.
- (1, 2, 3, 4): Invalid rectangle.

But again, with the current logic of the code, it may miss the other pairs due to how it restricts `b`.

Hence, there are potential cases where the function does not correctly count valid rectangles, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to cover all potential configurations of `a` and `b` leading to incorrect outputs, which retains invalid pairs under the conditions of forming a rectangle without forming a square.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 6) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, and n is greater than or equal to 6
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: if `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6, then `count` is the total number of valid pairs (a, b) calculated during the iterations, where `a` can range from 1 to `n // 4`, `b` equals `a`, and `rem` finally equals `n - 4 * (n // 4)` which will either be 0 or a negative value, derived from the conditions of rem being even and greater than 0 not being met in the final iterations of the loop.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of valid pairs (a, b) calculated during the iterations for positive integer n that is greater than or equal to 6.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
