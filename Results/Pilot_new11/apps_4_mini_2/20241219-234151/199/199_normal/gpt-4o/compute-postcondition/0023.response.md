Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 12; `rem` is equal to `n - 12`, `count` is 2, `a` is 3, and `b` is 3. If `rem` is greater than 0 and is even, and if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, then `count` is increased to 3. Otherwise, `count` remains 2.***
