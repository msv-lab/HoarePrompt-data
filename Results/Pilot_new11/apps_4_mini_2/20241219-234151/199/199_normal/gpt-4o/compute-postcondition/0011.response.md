Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is set to 1; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; and `rem` is equal to `n - 4`, remaining greater than 0 and even. If the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2, then `count` remains 1 while `a`, `b`, and `rem` remain unchanged.***
