Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem description. The problem specifies that Pasha wants to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square. 

The key points to note from the problem description are:
1. A rectangle can be formed using two pairs of equal lengths (i.e., lengths (a, a, b, b) where a and b are positive integers).
2. A square (which is a specific type of rectangle) cannot be formed. This means the lengths must not be all equal (i.e., a ≠ b).

Now let's analyze the code:

1. The function `func_1(n)` attempts to find pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `a + b = n / 2` and `a ≠ b`, which is not sufficient to enumerate all unique ways to form the required quadrilateral. The problem specifically asks for splitting into four parts, implying combinations of lengths that can form pairs in two different configurations.

2. However, even if `(a, a, b, b)` can form a rectangle, the range of `b` calculated in the loop `for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):` does not ensure that both pairs are counted correctly, limiting it to a linear scan rather than accounting for all necessary combinations.

3. Furthermore, the check to maintain `a ≠ b` inside the loop could potentially lead to missing valid configurations. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` may also lead to a conclusion that considers cases invalid as it suggests that only pairs `(a, b)` which lead to integer results for `n` are allowed.

The program does not take into account all eligible sums evenly dividing `n` into configurations that would facilitate creating a rectangle without leading to a square formation correctly. Thus, it does not follow the requirements specified in the problem description.

In summary, the program fails to generate the correct counts of configurations to achieve the conditions given in the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
