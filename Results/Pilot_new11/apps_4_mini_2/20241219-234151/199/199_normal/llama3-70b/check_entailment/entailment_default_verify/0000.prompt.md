You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The goal is to find the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. The lengths of the parts are positive integers.
2. The lengths can form a rectangle but cannot form a square.

The parts need to be in pairs because to form a rectangle, we need lengths that are equal for opposite sides. Therefore, the valid partitioning of the stick into four parts {a, a, b, b} should satisfy:
- \(2a + 2b = n\) 
- \(a\) must not equal \(b\) to avoid forming a square.

The program defines `func_1(n)` that:
1. Iterates `a` from 1 to \( n // 2 \).
2. For each `a`, iterates `b` from `a` to \( (n - a) // 2 \).
3. Checks if \( 2(a + b) = n \).
4. Checks that \( a \neq b \).
5. Counts valid combinations.

### Testing Potential Cases:
1. **Case n = 2**: 
   - The code will go through the loop; however, it will determine that no valid pairs (a, b) exist because the smallest positive integers are 1, which won't satisfy the conditions (only one positive integer less than or equal to 1).
   
2. **Case n = 5**:
   - It will yield zero valid combinations for the given inputs because it cannot reach a valid pair with integer halves.
   
3. **Case n = 6**:
   - As described in the example, this should yield exactly 1 valid configuration: {1, 1, 2, 2}. However, the loop doesn't seem capable of extracting pairs correctly based on the code logic, thus giving unintended results.
   
4. **Case n = 10**: 
   - The expected valid sets would be {1, 1, 4, 4}, {2, 2, 3, 3} forming a rectangle, which is 2 valid sets. The program may not differentiate correctly due to the chosen looping construct leading to missed counts.

Given these analyses, it appears that:
- There are specific lengths of `n` (like `2`, `5`, `3`) where valid rectangles cannot be formed at all, yet the code does not check for these discrete situations and how they impact the calculations of potential valid rectangles strictly meeting the criteria.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for all valid cases and can produce incorrect results for various inputs, especially where values are low or fail to meet the pairing requirement to avoid squares. The logic surrounding pair creation is flawed due to skipped counts, making cases unsolvable by the specified solution framework.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and counts the number of unique pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `a + b = n / 2`, where `a` is not equal to `b`, `1 ≤ a < b`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ n // 2`. If `n` is less than 2, the count of pairs remains 0. The pairs `(a, b)` are distinct in the sense that the order does not matter (i.e., `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are considered the same). Notably, if `n` is odd or less than 2, the function will naturally return 0 since there can be no pairs satisfying the condition. Therefore, the function effectively performs a counting operation within defined constraints, resulting in a non-negative integer output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
