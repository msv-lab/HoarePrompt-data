To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The goal is to find the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. The lengths of the parts are positive integers.
2. The lengths can form a rectangle but cannot form a square.

The parts need to be in pairs because to form a rectangle, we need lengths that are equal for opposite sides. Therefore, the valid partitioning of the stick into four parts {a, a, b, b} should satisfy:
- \(2a + 2b = n\) 
- \(a\) must not equal \(b\) to avoid forming a square.

The program defines `func_1(n)` that:
1. Iterates `a` from 1 to \( n // 2 \).
2. For each `a`, iterates `b` from `a` to \( (n - a) // 2 \).
3. Checks if \( 2(a + b) = n \).
4. Checks that \( a \neq b \).
5. Counts valid combinations.

### Testing Potential Cases:
1. **Case n = 2**: 
   - The code will go through the loop; however, it will determine that no valid pairs (a, b) exist because the smallest positive integers are 1, which won't satisfy the conditions (only one positive integer less than or equal to 1).
   
2. **Case n = 5**:
   - It will yield zero valid combinations for the given inputs because it cannot reach a valid pair with integer halves.
   
3. **Case n = 6**:
   - As described in the example, this should yield exactly 1 valid configuration: {1, 1, 2, 2}. However, the loop doesn't seem capable of extracting pairs correctly based on the code logic, thus giving unintended results.
   
4. **Case n = 10**: 
   - The expected valid sets would be {1, 1, 4, 4}, {2, 2, 3, 3} forming a rectangle, which is 2 valid sets. The program may not differentiate correctly due to the chosen looping construct leading to missed counts.

Given these analyses, it appears that:
- There are specific lengths of `n` (like `2`, `5`, `3`) where valid rectangles cannot be formed at all, yet the code does not check for these discrete situations and how they impact the calculations of potential valid rectangles strictly meeting the criteria.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for all valid cases and can produce incorrect results for various inputs, especially where values are low or fail to meet the pairing requirement to avoid squares. The logic surrounding pair creation is flawed due to skipped counts, making cases unsolvable by the specified solution framework.
