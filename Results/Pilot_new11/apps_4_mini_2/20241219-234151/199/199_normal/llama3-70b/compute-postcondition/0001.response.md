According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The range for `a` is defined from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, since the starting point is 1 and the upper limit (i.e., `n // 2 + 1`) must also be greater than 1. 

Given that initially `n` is a positive integer, there is a possibility that it could be equal to 1. In that case, the loop would not execute because the range would be effectively from 1 to 1, which doesn't allow for any iterations. 

Thus, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to assert that `n` is at least 2. The variable `a` will start at 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1**
