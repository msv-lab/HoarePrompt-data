The value of `ways` is incremented by 1, which means the total count of valid pairs `(2, b)` has increased. The value of `n` is at least 8, and it remains unchanged. There are no changes to the other variables, `a` and `b`, besides the fact that it is stated that `a` is 3, and `b` is some value where `a` does not equal `b`. The relevant states of the variables are still valid. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 8, `ways` has increased by 1, `a` is 3, `b` is a value such that `a` is not equal to `b`, and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.**
