According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `a` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. If `n` is at least 2, then `a` starts at 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` should be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1. The next value of `a` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, it needs to ensure that `a` is still less than or equal to `n // 2`. Given that `n` is at least 2, when `a` is incremented to 2, the loop can run again for the next value of `a`, provided that `n` is at least 4 (to keep `a` within the range).

Thus, the necessary states to adjust are:
- `ways` will still reflect the current count of pairs `(a, b)`, which may increase depending on the values computed in the loop.
- `a` will change to 2.
- We need to ensure `n` allows for `a` to be less than or equal to `n // 2`, which means `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `ways` is the count of pairs (a, b) such that `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, `a` is 2**
