To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and identify any potential cases that it may not handle correctly.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Function `func_1(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake.
   - It sets up a binary search between `1` and `min(a, b) + 1`.

2. **Function `can_distribute(x)`**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to distribute the cake such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.
   - The logic checks if the total number of pieces that can be distributed from both cakes divided by `x` is at least `n` (the number of plates).

### Potential Issues
The code has a significant flaw:
- The variable `a` and `b` are assumed to be in the scope of the `can_distribute` function, but they are not passed as parameters or defined globally in the code. 

Therefore, if `can_distribute` is called, it will throw a `NameError` for undefined `a` and `b`.

### Test Cases
To illustrate that the code does not work correctly:

1. Suppose we call `func_1(5, 2, 3)`. 
   - The program will attempt to execute `can_distribute(mid)`, but it will not be able to access `a` and `b`, leading to an error.
   
This indicates that the code will fail to execute correctly regardless of the input provided.

### Final Decision
Since the program does not handle a fundamental part of its logic due to the incorrect scoping of variables, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
