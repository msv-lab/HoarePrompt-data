Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b. If `can_distribute(mid)` is true, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, which remains strictly less than `high`, and `mid` is recalculated as (low + high) // 2. Otherwise, `low` remains strictly less than `high`, and `high` is updated to `mid`, while `mid` is still equal to (low + high) // 2.***
