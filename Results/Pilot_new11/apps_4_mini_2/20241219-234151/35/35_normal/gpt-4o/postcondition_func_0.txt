The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, and two positive integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of pieces of two cakes. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum number of pieces (`low - 1`) that can be distributed evenly, constrained by the minimum of `a` and `b`. The final return value, `low - 1`, indicates the last value that can be distributed based on the conditions checked by the `can_distribute` function. Note that the function assumes the existence of `can_distribute`, and potential edge cases involve scenarios where `a` or `b` is zero or very small, as well as cases where the distribution may not be possible at all. The function does not handle instances where `can_distribute` is either undefined or always returns False, which could lead to logic errors in a real application.
