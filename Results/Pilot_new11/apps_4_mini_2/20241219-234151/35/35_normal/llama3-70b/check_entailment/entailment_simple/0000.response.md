To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze its functionality step by step.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three integers: `n` (number of plates), `a` (pieces of the first cake), and `b` (pieces of the second cake).

2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes `x` to the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. This is appropriate because `x` must not exceed the available plates or pieces from either cake.

3. **While Loop Conditions**: The program enters a loop to find the maximum possible `x` such that:
   - There are enough pieces from the first cake to satisfy at least `x` pieces on its assigned plates.
   - There are enough pieces from the second cake to satisfy at least `x` pieces on its assigned plates.
   - The total remaining pieces after distributing `x` pieces from both cakes can still satisfy the remaining plates' requirements, meaning that the remaining pieces from cake `a` and cake `b` combined must also be able to cover at least the remaining plates.

4. **Terminal Conditions**: The loop continues decrementing `x` until it finds a value such that it meets the distribution criteria, or until `x` becomes zero.

5. **Output**: After determining the maximum valid `x`, it prints `x`.

The conditions checked in the while loop are crucial. They ensure that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake, while also confirming that no plate will have pieces from both cakes. The loop guarantees that `x` is driven down only as far as necessary and will terminate with a valid output (either finding an appropriate distribution or returning 0).

### Potential Edge Cases:
- When `n` is equal to `a + b`, and if all pieces can still meet the distribution criteria.
- When `a` and/or `b` are significantly smaller than `n`.

Through these considerations, the given code adheres well to the problem's constraints and requirements.

Upon reviewing the loop's conditions and the logic implemented, we see that the core requirement is to maximize `x` such that each plate gets an adequate number of pieces from only one cake. The program effectively does this by utilizing minimum checks and reducing `x` to find the maximum feasible distribution.

### Conclusion:
The provided program meets the requirements in the problem description for all valid inputs as outlined. It correctly computes and outputs the maximum pieces per plate under the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
