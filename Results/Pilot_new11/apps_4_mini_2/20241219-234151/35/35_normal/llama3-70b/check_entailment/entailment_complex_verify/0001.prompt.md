You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the key points and evaluate the code structure:

1. **Understanding Input and Output**: 
   - We expect three integers \( n \) (number of plates), \( a \) (pieces of the first cake), and \( b \) (pieces of the second cake).
   - The output should be the maximum number \( x \) such that all \( n \) plates can contain at least \( x \) pieces, with the following conditions:
     - Each piece of cake must be on a plate.
     - Each plate must contain at least one piece.
     - No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.

2. **Program Logic Review**:
   - The variable `x` is initially set to the minimum of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - The algorithm then enters a while loop where it checks if:
     - both cakes have at least \( x \) pieces left,
     - and if the remaining pieces of both cakes combined can satisfy \( x \) pieces for \( n \) plates.

3. **Checking for Edge Cases**:
   - The core of the condition `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)` seems erroneous; it's expecting enough combined pieces, but this logic could fail when the total pieces are not suitably divisible or arranged. 

### Potential Case where the Program Fails:

Let's consider an input case where:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = 1 \)

In this case:
- The maximum \( x \) should be 1, as we can only distribute one piece on each of the three plates, one for each plate (total of 3 pieces needed).
- On evaluating the program:
   - It starts with \( x = 1 \).
   - It checks the condition:
     - \( (1 \geq 1) \) and \( (1 \geq 1) \) are true.
     - But \( (1 - 1 + (1 - 1) \geq 1) \) is **false** (as \( 0 \geq 1 \) is false).
   - Thus, it decrements \( x \) to 0, which is invalid since plates can't have less than 1 piece each.

Therefore, this scenario demonstrates a clear failure of the underlying logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee the correct output for all potential cases given the constraints of the problem. Therefore, it should be deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
            break
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer, where the original value of `x` was equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`) and has been decreased until either `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x` holds true, or `x` reaches 0. If the loop executed successfully, then the final values of `a` and `b` must remain greater than or equal to the final value of `x`. If `x` reaches 0 without breaking, the last values of `a` and `b` still fulfill the balance condition for at least one piece from both cakes.
    print(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers, \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\), from user input. It determines the maximum number \(x\) of cake pieces that can be distributed such that there are enough pieces available from both cakes to satisfy the conditions: both cakes must have at least \(x\) pieces left after distribution, and the total remaining pieces after distribution must also be at least \(x\). The value \(x\) starts from the minimum of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) and decreases until these conditions are met or until \(x\) reaches zero. The function then outputs the determined value of \(x\

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
