The function reads three integers, \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\), from user input. It determines the maximum number \(x\) of cake pieces that can be distributed such that there are enough pieces available from both cakes to satisfy the conditions: both cakes must have at least \(x\) pieces left after distribution, and the total remaining pieces after distribution must also be at least \(x\). The value \(x\) starts from the minimum of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) and decreases until these conditions are met or until \(x\) reaches zero. The function then outputs the determined value of \(x\
