Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` and `b` are input integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively. If `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)` are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
