Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, where the original value of `x` was equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`) and has been decreased until either `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x` holds true, or `x` reaches 0. If the loop executed successfully, then the final values of `a` and `b` must remain greater than or equal to the final value of `x`. If `x` reaches 0 without breaking, the last values of `a` and `b` still fulfill the balance condition for at least one piece from both cakes.**
