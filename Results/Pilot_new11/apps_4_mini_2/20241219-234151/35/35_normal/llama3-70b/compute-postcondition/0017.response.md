The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates based on three implicit variables: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is an integer constrained by the condition \(1 ≤ n ≤ a + b\), `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake within the range \(1 ≤ a ≤ 100\), and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake within the range \(1 ≤ b ≤ 100\). 

The function's behavior will be determined by the values of these variables. Since the output was not specified, we can infer that it relates to the number of cake pieces based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates based on the values of integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\), where \(n\) must be within the range from 1 to \(a + b\), \(a\) must be between 1 and 100, and \(b\) must be between 1 and 100.**
