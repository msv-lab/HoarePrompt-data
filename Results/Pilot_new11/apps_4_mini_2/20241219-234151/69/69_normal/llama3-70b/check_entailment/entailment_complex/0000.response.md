Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the core issues include:

1. **Handling of Movement Counts**: 
   - The calculation of `dx` and `dy` is intended to represent how many movements in each direction are still required to reach the target `(x, y)`. However, the program uses the formula incorrectly. It calculates `dx` as `x - ux` and `dy` as `y - uy`, but these values are misinterpreted afterward during the iterations. The `ux` and `uy` values do not properly represent the number of operations that can be redirected to offset the movement deficits.

2. **Determining Feasibility**:
   - The program incorrectly determines if reaching `(x, y)` is impossible. It checks if `dx < 0 or dy < 0` which does not accurately represent if it is impossible to reach the target. Since the robot can substitute operations, there are scenarios where movements may be redirected while still having positive offsets.

3. **Counting Changes**:
   - The counting of redundant operations (stored in `res`) does not yield the length of the minimal subsegment change as required. The program is instead incorrectly incrementing `res` for operations that cannot be made instead of tracking indices where changes are indeed needed.

4. **Missing Edge Case**:
   - The program fails to consider immediately if `ux` and `uy` already equate to the target `x` and `y` prior to looping through operations. If this is the case, it should immediately return `0` without going through the rest of the process.

Example Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  3
  UUU
  100 100
  ```
  According to the program, it would evaluate `dx` and `dy`, find they are negative, and incorrectly print `-1`, indicating impossibility. The program lacks the logic to identify how many operations must change based on substitutive possibilities.

Thus, the logic flow and conditions employed do not match the specified problem requirements or guarantee the correct output in every given situation.
