`ux` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions specify that `n` must be greater than 0, indicating that `ops` exists and thus `ux` has a defined value. However, the original value of `ux` is unknown. The state of other variables remains unchanged, and the specific values of `n`, `ops`, and `op` do not affect the operation on `ux`. Therefore, the output state involves only the change in `ux`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the first character of `ops` which is not equal to 'U' or 'D', the current value of `op` is 'R', and `ux` is increased by 1.**
