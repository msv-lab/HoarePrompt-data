`dy` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `dy` is less than 0, so after the increment, `dy` will become 0 or greater. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is now greater than or equal to 0, `ops` is a non-empty string of length greater than 0, `res` is 0, `op` is 'D', and the previous value of `dy` was less than 0.**
