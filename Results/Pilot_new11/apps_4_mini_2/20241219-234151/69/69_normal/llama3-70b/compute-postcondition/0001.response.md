The value of `ops` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input that is guaranteed to have a length equal to `n`. The other variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `ops` is a string of length `n`; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `ops` is a string of length `n`; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9.**
