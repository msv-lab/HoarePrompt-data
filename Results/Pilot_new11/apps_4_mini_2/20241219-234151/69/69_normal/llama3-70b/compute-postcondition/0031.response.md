`uy` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `ops`, `op`, and `ux` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the third character of `ops`, `uy` is decremented by 1, and `ux` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the third character of `ops`, `uy` is decremented by 1, and `ux` remains unchanged.**
