`uy` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `uy` is unknown. The other variables (`n`, `ops`, and `op`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `uy` has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the second character of `ops`, and `uy` is increased by 1.**
