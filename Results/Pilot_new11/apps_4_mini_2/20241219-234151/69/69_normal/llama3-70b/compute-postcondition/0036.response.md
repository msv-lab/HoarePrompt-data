Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `ops` is a string of length `n`, and `op` is the third character of `ops`. If `op` is 'D', then `uy` is decremented by 1 and `ux` remains unchanged. If `op` is not 'D', then `uy` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `op` is 'L', then `ux` is updated to `ux - 1`.***
