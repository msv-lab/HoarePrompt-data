The value of `ux` is decremented by 1. The variable `n` is greater than 2, and both `uy` and `ux` remain unchanged as per the initial state. The value of `ux` is unknown, so we cannot specify its exact new value apart from knowing it is now 1 less than its previous value. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the third character of `ops`, `uy` remains unchanged, and `ux` is now `ux - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the third character of `ops`, `uy` remains unchanged, `ux` is now `ux - 1`**.
