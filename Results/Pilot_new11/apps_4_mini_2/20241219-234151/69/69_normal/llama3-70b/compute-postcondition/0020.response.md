According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters in the string `ops`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one character remaining in `ops`. The variable `op` currently holds the first character of `ops`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `op` must advance to the next character in `ops`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `op` must now be the second character in the string, and `n` must decrease by 1, indicating one less character remaining to process. 

Thus, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, as the current loop iteration processes one character of `ops`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, and `op` is the second character of `ops`.**
