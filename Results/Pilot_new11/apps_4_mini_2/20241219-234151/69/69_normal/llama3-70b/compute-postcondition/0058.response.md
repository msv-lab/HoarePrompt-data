Postcondition: ***`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, if `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, `dx` is incremented by 1 such that it now satisfies `dx` less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `dx` remains as `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is incremented by 1 from 0, maintaining the conditions regarding `op`, `dy`, and `dx` as specified in the precondition. If `op` is not 'L', then `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, and all other conditions regarding `ops`, `res`, and directional movements hold true.***
