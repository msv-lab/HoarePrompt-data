Postcondition: ***`ux` is the number of 'R' minus 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' minus 'D' in `ops`. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is equal to `x - ux + 1` and `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, with `res` remaining 0 and at least one operation left in `ops`. Otherwise, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, with at least one operation remaining in `ops`.***
