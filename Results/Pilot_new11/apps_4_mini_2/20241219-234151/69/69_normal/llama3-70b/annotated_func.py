#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (1 <= n <= 200000), ops is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and x and y are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.

    n = int(input())

If the loop does not execute, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `res` retain their initial calculated values based on `ops`.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`ux` is equal to the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`; `dx` is equal to `x - ux`; `dy` is equal to `y - uy`; if either `dx` or `dy` is less than 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `res` is printed reflecting the count of invalid operations in `ops`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, a string `ops` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It tracks movements based on the instructions in `ops`. It calculates two values `ux` and `uy`, which represent the net horizontal and vertical movements from the starting point based on the operations given. It computes the difference `dx` and `dy`, which are the remaining movements required to reach a target position `(x, y)` from the current position. If either `dx` or `dy` is negative after computing, it outputs `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to reach the target based on the operations. If reaching the target is feasible, it counts how many operations in `ops` cannot contribute to a valid movement towards the target (given the current conditions) and outputs that count. Lastly, if no operations can fulfill the movement requirements, `res` will reflect that, potentially outputting the total number of operations that remain redundant. The function properly considers various edge cases, such as when movements cannot make the required adjustments to reach `(x, y)`, and it ensures to evaluate each operation relevantly.
