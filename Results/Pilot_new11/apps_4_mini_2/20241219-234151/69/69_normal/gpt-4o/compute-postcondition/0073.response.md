Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), and `i` is 1. If the operation at index `i` is 'L', then `position_map` contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 0`. Otherwise, if the operation at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` is updated to `current_x + 1` and `position_map` contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 1`.***
