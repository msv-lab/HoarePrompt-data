The code assigns a new value to `target_pos` by calculating it as the sum of `current_x` plus `dx` and `current_y` plus `dy`. The values of `current_x` and `current_y` remain unchanged, so only `target_pos` is affected by this operation.

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`.**
