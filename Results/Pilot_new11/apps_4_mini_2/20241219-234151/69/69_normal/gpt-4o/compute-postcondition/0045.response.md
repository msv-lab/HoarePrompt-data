The code initializes a dictionary named `position_map`, which maps the tuple `(0, 0)` to the value `-1`. This dictionary is used to potentially store the position of movements and associated values, but only the mapping of the initial position to `-1` is set.

The other variables, such as `final_x`, `final_y`, `n`, `operations`, `dx`, `dy`, `min_length`, `current_x`, and `current_y`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`final_x` is the result of the net movements in the horizontal direction calculated as (number of 'R' - number of 'L'); `final_y` is the result of the net movements in the vertical direction calculated as (number of 'U' - number of 'D'); `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); `operations` is a string of length `n`; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is set to positive infinity (float('inf')); `current_x` is 0; `current_y` is 0; `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}.**
