According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer with the constraint (1 <= n <= 200000), the loop will execute if n is at least 1. The `final_x` and `final_y` values provide the net movements, but they don't influence the execution of the loop directly.

At the start of the loop, `i` is going to iterate from 0 to n-1. There are no changes required for `current_x`, `current_y`, `position_map`, `dx`, `dy`, or `min_length` to execute the loop. 

Thus, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized. 

State: **`final_x` is the result of net movements, `final_y` is the result of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 0**
