The code `current_y += 1` increases the value of `current_y` by 1 unit. The initial state specifies that `final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements and indicates a relationship between `n`, `i`, and the constraint that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

However, there is no information provided about the initial state of `current_y`. Thus, the exact value of `current_y` after the operation will depend on its previous value, which is unspecified. The overall information about `final_x`, `final_y`, `n`, and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` must be greater than `i + 1, and `current_y` is increased by 1.**
