According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current loop index, and `n` is a positive integer up to 200000. 

Since the loop iterates from `0` through `n-1`, for the loop to run one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` needs to be `i + 1`. Furthermore, for the loop to execute again, the value of `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, we can state that:
- `final_x` and `final_y` remain the results of net movements from the last iteration.
- `i` needs to increase by 1.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, or mathematically, `n` must be greater than the new `i`.

State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
