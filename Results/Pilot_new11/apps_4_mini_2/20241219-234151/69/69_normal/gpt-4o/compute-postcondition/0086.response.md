Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements. If `operations[i]` is 'L', `current_x` is decreased by 1. If `operations[i]` is 'R', `current_x` is increased by 1. In both cases, `n` must be greater than `i + 1,` reflecting the updated state of the program with the modified value of `current_x`.***
