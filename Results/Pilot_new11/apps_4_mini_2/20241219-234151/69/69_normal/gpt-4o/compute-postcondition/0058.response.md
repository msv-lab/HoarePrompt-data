Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer where 1 <= n <= 200000, and `i` is 0. If the operation at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1; if the operation at index `i` is neither 'R', the values of `final_x`, `final_y`, and `current_x` remain unchanged.***
