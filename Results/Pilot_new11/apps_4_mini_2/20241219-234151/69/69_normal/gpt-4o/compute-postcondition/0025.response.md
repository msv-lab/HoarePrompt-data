Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, if `op` is 'D', then `final_y` has decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1 and `final_y` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is incremented by 1 while `final_y` remains unchanged. If `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', `final_x` and `final_y` remain unchanged.***
