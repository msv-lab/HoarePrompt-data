The value of `final_x` is decremented by 1. The variable `final_x` is affected, while the other variables (`n`, `operations`, and `op`) remain unchanged. Since most information about the current values of `final_x` has not been provided, we just know that `final_x` is one less than its initial value. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the next character in `operations`, `final_x` is decreased by 1, `final_y` remains unchanged.**
