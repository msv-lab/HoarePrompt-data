You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        target_pos = (current_x + dx, current_y + dy)
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and check if it handles all potential cases correctly.

1. **Understanding the Code:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` (number of operations), a string of operations (which can include 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'), and the target coordinates `(x, y)`.
   - It calculates the final position `(final_x, final_y)` after executing the initial sequence of operations.
   - It computes the difference in x and y coordinates (`dx` and `dy`) to determine what adjustments need to be made.
   - If `dx` and `dy` are both 0, it means the sequence already reaches the target, and it returns `0` as no changes are needed.
   - The program uses a mapping to track positions the robot has been to, and checks if it can adjust the operations to reach the target using a minimum length change.

2. **Analyzing Edge Cases:**
   - The code checks if the final position matches `(x, y)`. If it does, it returns `0`.
   - If the required adjustments exceed the number of available operations (for example, needing more 'U' than available), it would be impossible to reach the target.
   - The code correctly handles cases where manipulation of a contiguous subsequence is needed to adjust the operations to reach the desired end location.

3. **Potential Cases to Consider:**
   - Let's consider a test case where the number of operations is less than needed to reach the target. For example:
     - Input: 
       ```
       2
       UR
       1 2
       ```
     - Here, `UR` means we move to `(1,1)` after two operations. The target `(1, 2)` cannot be reached because we have only two moves and can't change them to create more upward movement.
     - The expected output would be `-1`, indicating impossibility. The program should handle this case correctly.
   - Another edge case would be if `n` is `1` and the operations are exactly matching to the target:
     - Input:
       ```
       1
       U
       0 1
       ```
     - Expected Output: `0`, since we are already at `(0,1)`.

4. **Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis above and the consideration of edge cases, the program seems to correctly identify scenarios where it is impossible to reach a destination and calculates minimum lengths of subsequence adjustments correctly.

Hence, since all checks seem to be handled and I cannot find a counterexample where it fails:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); operations is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'; x and y are integers with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1

    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if (dx == 0 and dy == 0) :
        return 0

    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
    #The program returns min_length if it is not positive infinity; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating whether a sequence of movements exists that returns to the same position.
