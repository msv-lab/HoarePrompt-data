You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        target_pos = (current_x + dx, current_y + dy)
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program for the described problem, we need to analyze its logic and check for any potential edge cases that it might not handle correctly.

Let's break down the problem requirements:
1. The robot can perform a sequence of movements (U, D, L, R).
2. We want the robot to reach the coordinates (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).
3. The goal is to compute the minimum length of subsegment that can be changed to allow the robot to arrive at the target coordinates.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Initial Position Calculation**: The program first calculates the final position of the robot based on the given operations. This is done accurately with a loop counting the number of U, D, L, and R moves.

2. **Difference Calculation**: The `dx` and `dy` variables represent how far off the robot's final position is from the target position. This part is logical.

3. **Early Exit**: If `dx` and `dy` are both zero, it correctly returns 0 since no changes are needed.

4. **Finding Minimum Length of Change**:
   - The program uses a dictionary (`position_map`) to keep track of previously visited coordinates and their indices.
   - It checks if the current position adjusted by the needed changes `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` exists in the `position_map`.
   - If it finds a match, it computes the length of the segment that must be changed.
   - It then updates the `position_map` with the current coordinates and index.

### Potential Issues
Now let's consider the potential problems:
- The program calculates the required changes based on straightforward coordinate adjustments. However, it does not validate whether it is indeed *possible* to change the operations such that the robot can reach (x, y). For example, if `n` is less than `|x| + |y|`, then there is simply not enough operations to reach (x, y), and the program would return -1, which is correct. However, we must ensure that it checks whether the movements can be achieved even with changes.

#### Let's consider an input case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  U
  1 1
  ```
  Expected output: -1 (not enough moves to reach (1, 1)). But since there are insufficient moves defined in the operations, if it allows the program to compute, it should directly reflect impossibility.

### Conclusion
The code appears to have a logical structure that should work for most cases. However, it does not explicitly check for the feasibility of reaching (x, y) based on the number of given commands. In cases where the target position requires more steps than are available, it might lead to incorrect scenarios not covered.

**Correctness: ** False **.** 

In reality, the code does not directly address whether reaching the target is possible by counting how many moves are needed versus how many are available. A check ensuring that `n` meets or exceeds `|x| + |y|` would enhance its correctness significantly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 200000), a string `operations` of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y` (with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9). It processes the `operations` string to calculate net movements in both horizontal (`final_x`) and vertical (`final_y`) directions. Initially, it checks if the calculated position `(final_x, final_y)` matches the target position `(x, y)`, returning 0 if they match. If not, it seeks the shortest substring of movements that returns to the starting position by maintaining a mapping of visited positions and their indices. The function then returns the minimum length of such a substring if found; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate no such sequence exists. The function thus determines whether the movements can return to an original position and provides the length of the shortest such sequence. Edge cases include handling a zero-length `operations` string (though `n` is constrained), and scenarios where no valid return path exists, resulting in a return value of -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
