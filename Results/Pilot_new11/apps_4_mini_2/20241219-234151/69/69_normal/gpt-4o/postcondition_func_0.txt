The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 200000), a string `operations` of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y` (with -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9). It processes the `operations` string to calculate net movements in both horizontal (`final_x`) and vertical (`final_y`) directions. Initially, it checks if the calculated position `(final_x, final_y)` matches the target position `(x, y)`, returning 0 if they match. If not, it seeks the shortest substring of movements that returns to the starting position by maintaining a mapping of visited positions and their indices. The function then returns the minimum length of such a substring if found; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate no such sequence exists. The function thus determines whether the movements can return to an original position and provides the length of the shortest such sequence. Edge cases include handling a zero-length `operations` string (though `n` is constrained), and scenarios where no valid return path exists, resulting in a return value of -1.
