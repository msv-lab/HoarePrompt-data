To assess the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, let's analyze the functions and their output hints in the context of the requirements of the problem.

**Problem Breakdown:**
- The problem asks to find integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by them is equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
- The triangle's area is given by \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). So to find three points that satisfy this area condition requires careful selection of coordinates within the provided bounds.

**Analysis of Functions:**

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The output hint states that if both parameters are 0, it returns 0, which is mathematically ambiguous.
   - The program does not need to handle the case of both numbers being zero since the inputs are constrained (minimum values of 1 and 2). Therefore, this function's output hint does not affect the correctness of the overall program under the given constraints.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function implements part of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and provides values related to finding GCD coefficients. 
   - The hint indicates it doesn't handle negative inputs or invalid values, but since `a` and `b` are expected to be valid integers between 1 and \(10^9\), this does not affect correctness according to the given premises.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function aims to provide a way to express the area condition by calling `func_2` and returning coordinates based on the results.
   - According to the hint, the function may return coordinates that when calculated give the area, but it checks the condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` before proceeding.
   - **Potential mistake**: If `g` is not properly calculated or if the area \( \frac{nm}{k} \) cannot lie within the limits for certain values of `k`, the function will incorrectly state "YES" or "NO" based on the result of this condition and the multiplication checks.

**Edge Cases and Validity**:
The area being an integer is critical; the code checks if \( n \times m \mod k \) results in a non-zero value and then outputs "NO". However, if the area isn't a whole number or if the GCD logic leads to invalid coordinates, it could fall short.

**Examples provided**:
- Given `4 3 3`, the expected area \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \). The function outputs valid triangle points that do give this area.
- Conversely, with `4 4 7`, it finds the area is \( \frac{16}{7} \), which is a non-integer, hence outputs "NO".

**Conclusion**:
While the code meets the requirements for the tested cases, it does not account for fractional areas properly in its outputs due to the conditions set forth. Specifically, the function might provide a "YES" in scenarios where the area ultimately cannot form integer values or valid triangles.

Therefore, there exist edge cases where the program's logic does not cover all possibilities comprehensively, particularly when checking integer constraints and configurations for potential triangle formations.

Correctness: **False**.
