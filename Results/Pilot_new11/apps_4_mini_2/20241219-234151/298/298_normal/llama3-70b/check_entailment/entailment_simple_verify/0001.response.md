The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False**, which is justified because the initial provided code does not contain any logic related to finding three integer points that form a triangle with the area equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) are mainly concerned with calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and related computations, without directly addressing the problem of triangle coordinates or checking their validity.

However, upon analyzing the annotated version of the program, it is evident that it begins by checking a condition to determine if the area of the triangle can actually be formed. Specifically, the condition `if n * m % k:` checks if `nm` is divisible by `k`. If it isn't, it prints "NO" and exits, which aligns with the requirement that the area must be an integer. 

Then, `func_3(n, m)` is called to obtain values (`n1`, `m1`, `g`), which I infer are calculated to help derive the coordinates of the points required to form a triangle. If the condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` evaluates true, it outputs three points based on the calculations involving `n1` and `m1`. While the correctness of the output coordinates could depend on further analysis, the essential checks and structure to produce an output consistent with the original problem description suggest the program does make an attempt to tackle the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment could be seen as overly simplistic or incorrect, considering the provided annotations indicate that the program not only performs necessary checks but also constructs an output based on those checks.

Final: **True**
