The original assessment indicated that the program is incorrect because it does not contain logic to determine whether three points form a triangle with the required area. Upon reviewing the provided annotated code, it is clear that the program checks the area condition by using the condition `if n * m % k:` to determine if the area can be represented as an integer. If the area is not an integer, the program outputs "NO" directly.

The subsequent logic utilizes the Extended Euclidean algorithm (expressed in `func_3`) to generate potential coordinates for the triangle based on the calculated values. If the condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` holds, it proceeds to generate and print the three points. Therefore, the program includes the necessary conditions and computations to output coordinates that meet the problem's requirements when possible.

Thus, the program has been correctly structured to fulfill the conditions of the problem description. It could fail in some edge cases, but based on the information provided through the annotations, there is a systematic approach in producing output per the problem requirements when valid.

The original assessment's conclusion that the program is entirely incorrect does not hold true based on the annotations, which demonstrate an understanding of calculating whether such points exist and generating them accordingly.

Final: **True**
