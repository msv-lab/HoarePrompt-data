Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether a valid triangle can be formed under the given constraints. Specifically, the area of the triangle formed by the points is given by the formula for the area of a triangle based on its vertices, which is not properly computed or validated in all cases by the current logic.

Here's an issue with the existing logic:
- The program checks if the computed area is an integer and not zero, which is correct initially. However, it does not account for cases where the derived triangle vertices fail to respect the condition of being within the given bounds `[0, n]` for x-coordinates and `[0, m]` for y-coordinates, especially when `2 * area` exceeds both `n` and `m`.
- For instance, if both `n` and `m` are smaller than `2 * area` while being valid integers, the determined point coordinates will not lie within the valid ranges and thus will lead to an invalid triangle area.

Example case where it fails:
- Input: `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
- Computed area is `3`, which is valid. The program attempts to generate points but the conditions do not ensure that all points stay within the confines `[0, n]` and `[0, m]`. If it tries to compute `2 * area`, it would yield coordinates that exceed these limits, producing incorrect outputs.

Thus, the code does not establish the presence of valid coordinates covering all scenarios, leading to a conclusion that the program is indeed inaccurate in some cases.
