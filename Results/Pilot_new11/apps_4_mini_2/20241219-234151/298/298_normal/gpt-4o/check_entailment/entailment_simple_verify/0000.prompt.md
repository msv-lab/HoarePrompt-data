You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The program attempts to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
1. \(0 \leq x_1, x_2, x_3 \leq n\)
2. \(0 \leq y_1, y_2, y_3 \leq m\)
3. The area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

We analyze a potential issue with the logic for determining valid points based on the area.

1. **Calculating Area**: The area is first calculated by the formula `area = n * m / k`. The program then checks if this area is an integer.
   - If \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is not an integer, it is correctly outputting "NO".

2. **Checking Area is Zero**: If the area turns out to be 0 (which should never happen due to the constraints \(n, m \geq 1\)), it outputs "NO". 

3. **Finding Points**:
   - The algorithm tries to find the coordinates based on specific checks for \(2 \times \text{area}\) and uses fixed coordinates for points like (0, 0) and attempted points like \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\) or \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\).

### Potential Issues:

1. **Area Calculation**: The area must be computed accurately, and integral checks must take into account whether \(k\) divides \(nm\) precisely. If \(nm\) is not divisible by \(k\) and the output is being computed through double the area, the triangle might not actually exist.

2. **Point Validity**: The choices of points \( (2 \times \text{area}, 1) \) or \( (1, 2 \times \text{area}) \) are based on certain assumptions about the relation between `area` and `n` or `m`. For high values of `k` resulting in very small area, this could yield invalid coordinates exceeding \(n\) or \(m\).

3. **Corner Cases**: For input values \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\), the area becomes \( \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \), which is not an integer, hence outputting "NO" rightly. However, increasing \(k\) while keeping \(n\) and \(m\) small can lead to premature output without exploring possible integer point configurations.

4. **No Output for Certain Cases**: Some cases may yield no valid outputs if they fall through the checks without being handled. For instance, if \( nm < k \) or odd \( \frac{nm}{k} \) where points cannot be chosen appropriately might be overlooked.

### Conclusion:

Due to the above potential issues, the program is flawed in some scenarios and can lead to incorrect outputs. Certain numerical configurations, especially where the relations don't hold for \(x, y\) bounds, are not handled explicitly.

Correctness: **False**. 

In particular, consider input values like \(n = 4\), \(m = 4\), \(k = 8\). The area is \(\frac{16}{8} = 2\), but the point selection logic could yield negative coordinates or exceed bounds, leading to an inability to create a triangle satisfying the area condition due to not establishing a true triangle structure within valid bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')

        area = int(area)

Otherwise, since `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `'0 {m // 2}'`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. If `area` is equal to 0, 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output `0 1` is printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then the output `1 0` is printed. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `0 {m // 2}`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 and 2 and 10^9 respectively. If `area` is not an integer, then 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is equal to 0, 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output `0 1` is printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then the output `1 0` is printed. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `0 {m // 2}`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
