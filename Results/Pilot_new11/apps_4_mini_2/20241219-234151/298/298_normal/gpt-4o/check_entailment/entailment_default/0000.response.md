To verify the correctness of the given program, we begin by thoroughly analyzing the problem description and the program's implementation.

The problem description states that Vasya needs to find three integer points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) such that:
1. Each point’s coordinates are within the bounds: \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\) and \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\).
2. The area of the triangle formed by these three points must be equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

The program implements the following logic:
1. It calculates the area as \(\text{area} = \frac{nm}{k}\) and checks if this area is an integer. If the area is not an integer or is \(0\), it outputs "NO".
2. If the area is valid, it prints "YES" and attempts to compute coordinates based on conditions stemming from the value of \(2 \times \text{area}\).

Next, we analyze the provided output hints which state that if the area is not an integer or is zero, the program prints "NO". If it can compute coordinates based on conditions involving \(2 \times \text{area}\), it prints specific coordinates. 

**Key Observations:**
- If \(k\) is greater than \(nm\), then \(\frac{nm}{k}\) will be less than \(1\), making it impossible to form a triangle with non-zero area.
- The program's approach to generating points involves computing \(2 \times \text{area}\) and checking it against bounds \(n\) and \(m\). However, potential issues arise if the area is not constructed properly based on the calculated triangles.

**Potential Failure Case:**
Consider specific values:
- Let \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\). In this case:
  - The area calculates to \(\frac{1 \cdot 1}{2} = 0.5\), which is not an integer, and the program correctly outputs "NO".
  
Now let’s take \(k\) slightly larger for additional cases:
- If \(k = 3\), the area becomes \(\frac{1 \cdot 1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\), also non-integer and it outputs "NO".
  
- Finally, let’s set \(n = 3\), \(m = 3\), and \(k = 3\). Here:
  - The area is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\), which is valid.
  - If the program proceeds with certain assumptions, it might not fully satisfy the triangle area condition based on the coordinates generated depending on the underlying logic in relation to point placements.

The main concern lies in specific checks for valid triangle formations under varying conditions of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). 

Thus, after thorough examination, it becomes apparent that the program may miscalculate or fail to provide valid points in certain configurations, particularly around conditions where the specified area is ambiguous or conflicts with coordinate boundaries.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and can fail to produce valid results for triangles in certain configurations, illustrating that it does not fulfill the problem's requirements universally.
