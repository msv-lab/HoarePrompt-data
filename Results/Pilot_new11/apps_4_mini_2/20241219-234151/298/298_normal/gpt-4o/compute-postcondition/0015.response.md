Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k` which remains an integer, it is false that `2 * area <= n` (therefore, `2 * area` is greater than `n`), and the current value of `m` is greater than or equal to `2 * area`, indicating that `2 * area <= m`. The program outputs 'YES'.***
