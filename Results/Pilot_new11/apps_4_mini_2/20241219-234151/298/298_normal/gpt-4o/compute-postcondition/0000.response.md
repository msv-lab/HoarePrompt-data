The code takes input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` and assigns them directly. The conditions specify that `n`, `m` are integers between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^9. Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown prior to input, their updated values will be based on the input received and will replace the previous unknown values.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9.**
