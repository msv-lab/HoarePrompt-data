The value of `area` is reassigned as the integer value of `area`, but since `area` is already defined as `n * m / k` and is specified to be an integer, the operation does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes all original variables and confirms that `area` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9, and `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, which remains an integer.**
