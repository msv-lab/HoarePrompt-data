The code simply prints the string '0 0'. There are no variable assignments or calculations that alter the state of the initial variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. The values of these variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k` which remains an integer, and the program outputs 'YES'.**
