Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The key issue lies in the function `func_1`, which is incorrectly stated to accept a string argument, while the comments suggest it is handling a tuple. Furthermore, the explanation of the function's behavior inaccurately describes its input and output.

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` claims to compute a value based on a binary string, but the comments hint at it working with a tuple containing two strings. This is misleading and suggests it may not function as intended.

2. **Value Calculation**: The function calculates the value derived from the golden ratio based on positions of '1's in the binary string only. The summation is done correctly for the input string but does not take into account the necessary comparisons against two different binary numbers provided in the input. The main logic in the main program is correct, but it relies on the faulty `func_1`.

3. **Lack of Output Validation**: The program does not handle leading zeros appropriately. For instance, according to binary number rules, "00100" and "11" should both yield the same value, but depending on implementation details of floating-point arithmetic in Python, the computed values may not be comparable accurately if they become too close.

4. **Precision Issues**: Since this program depends on floating-point calculations that might not be precise enough for very large exponents, it might produce incorrect comparisons for larger strings approaching the limit of 100,000 characters.

For these reasons, the program does not consistently compute the correct values for comparisons of the golden number representation, thus failing to meet the problem description requirements effectively for all cases.
