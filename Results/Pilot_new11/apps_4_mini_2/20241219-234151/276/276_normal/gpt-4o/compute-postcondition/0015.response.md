The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a tuple containing two non-empty strings, each consisting solely of '0' and '1' characters, with the length of each string not exceeding 100,000 characters. After executing the function body, it returns the value 1 based on the values of `s[0]` and `s[1]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of two binary strings and return the integer value 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple s containing two non-empty binary strings and returns the integer value 1.**
