To analyze the given code snippet: 

1. We start with the initial state where `s` is a list of two non-empty strings, `i` is 2, `c` is `s[0]`, and `decimal` is updated with the expression `decimal + int(c) * q`.
2. The new line of code reads:
   ```
   decimal += int(c) * q ** i
   ```
3. Here, `c` holds `s[0]`, and the exponentiation operator `**` raises `q` to the power of `i` (which is 2). This means the value being added to `decimal` is the product of `int(c)` and `q` squared.
4. Therefore, `decimal` will be updated to its previous value plus `int(c) * (q ** 2)`.

Since there is no explicit change to `s`, `i`, or `c` besides their involvement in the calculation, we retain their initial values and only update `decimal`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of two non-empty strings, `i` is 2, `c` is `s[0]`, `decimal` is updated to `decimal + int(c) * (q ** 2)`**
