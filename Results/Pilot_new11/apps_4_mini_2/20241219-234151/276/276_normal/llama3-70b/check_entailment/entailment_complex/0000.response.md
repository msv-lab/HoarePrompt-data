Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description. The critical flaw lies in how the `func_1` function is defined and used. The function takes a single string `s` as input (which is a single binary number) and computes its decimal value according to the golden ratio. However, in the main part of the program, it is invoked with `a` and `b` as separate strings, meaning that each string is processed individually.

Here's a detailed explanation of why it is incorrect:

1. **Function Logic:** 
   - The function `func_1` should not be interpreting just one string but should effectively handle two strings that represent two separate golden system numbers. The function as implemented assumes each call is on a separate binary string, but the problem description requires that both numbers be compared in terms of their total decimal values as specified by the golden system.

2. **Input Processing:**
   - `func_1` is called separately for `a` and `b`, and it calculates their respective decimal values independently. There is no function that considers both inputs as a combined entity for comparison, thereby missing the opportunity to evaluate their relative sizes based on the rules of the golden system.

3. **Expected Output and Comparison:**
   - Due to this method of separate processing, the program may yield incorrect comparisons depending on the string values. For instance, if one string is effectively representing a much larger number than the other, the output may not reflect the true relationship between the two numbers.

Because of these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem statement. The incorrect handling of input and output logic leads to potentially erroneous comparisons of the two numbers.
