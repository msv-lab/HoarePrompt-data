You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
The program is meant to convert two strings representing numbers in a unique system (the "golden system") into their decimal values and compare them. The golden system uses the ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \) as the base.

### Code Inspection:
1. The code reads two input strings, each consisting of '0's and '1's.
2. It defines a function `func_1(s)` that computes the decimal value from the golden system representation. The function iterates through each character in the string, calculates its contribution to the decimal value, and sums it.
3. The values are compared and output as `>`, `<`, or `=`.

### Considerations:
- The evaluation of the two values is done by taking the reverse of the string and applying the formula \( \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i} \).
  
### Test Cases:
Let's check a few scenarios to identify if there's a potential case where the implementation might fail.

1. **Leading Zeros**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     000
     0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `=`
   - The program correctly interprets both as `0`.

2. **Variation in Length with Zeros**:
   - Input:
     ```
     001
     01
     ```
   - Expected Output: `=`
   - The program should consider both as equivalent decimal values.

3. **Different Non-Equal Values**:
   - Input:
     ```
     101
     11
     ```
   - Expected Output: `>`
   - As per calculation:
     - `101` would render dimensions of \( q^2 + 0 \cdot q^1 + q^0 \) which is larger than \( q^1 + q^0 \).

4. **Maximum Length Strings**:
   - Testing the length of strings approaching 100,000 could also reveal performance issues, but not correctness issues.

### Critical Understanding:
- A problematic situation arises with floating-point precision as \( q \) grows. For example, comparing values directly computed from `q` might not yield the correct result due to precision errors, especially when the input strings are large.

### Conclusion:
Upon careful consideration, while the logic of the program appears sound for various test cases presented by the problem statement, the reliance on floating-point arithmetic could lead to inaccuracies in comparing very close values derived from large input strings that result in sums with minor differences. Hence, the program may not handle every potential case correctly, particularly when dealing with values near each other.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**  
Explanation: The program does not account for precision issues that arise when working with floating-point numbers, which could lead to incorrect comparisons for large significant digits in the string representation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of two non-empty strings, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100,000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a list of two non-empty strings, `decimal` is the decimal representation of the binary values of the strings in `s`, `i` is equal to the length of `s` and `c` represents the characters from the two strings in `s`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the decimal representation of the binary values of the two non-empty strings in the list 's'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
