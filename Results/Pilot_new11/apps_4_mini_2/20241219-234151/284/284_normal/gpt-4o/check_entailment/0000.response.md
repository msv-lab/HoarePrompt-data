To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code carefully.

The program takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and enters a loop for integer `m` ranging from 1 to 1000. For each `m`, it checks if `n * m + 1` is not a prime number using the function `func_1`.

The issues we need to check for correctness include:

1. **Understanding of prime checking**: The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime. If it returns `False`, it indicates that the number is not prime which is the desired behavior.

2. **Range of m**: The loop for `m` correctly goes from 1 to 1000 which satisfies the problem's requirement. The loop will stop and print the first `m` for which `n * m + 1` is not prime.

3. **Guaranteed existence of a counterexample**: The problem states that a solution exists and that the program is required to find it. The logic checks every integer in the valid range for `m`.

4. **Output correctness**: If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, `m` is printed, thus providing an appropriate counterexample for the claim made by PolandBall.

However, there is a subtle issue to notice. If the provided program fails to find a valid `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not prime (which should not happen according to the guarantee), it may imply that the logic is flawed to find all cases.

Testing specific values can reveal the flaws. For example:
- If `n = 1`, then `m` starting at 1 gives `1 * 1 + 1 = 2`, which is prime. 
- Next, `m = 2` gives `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`, which is also prime.
- Continuing this way, all results for `n = 1` are indeed prime up to `m = 1000`.

This indicates that for `n = 1`, the code might not find a suitable m, contradicting the statement that a solution must exist.

Based on this analysis:
Correctness: **False**.
