The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 1000. 

- If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`.
- If `num` is a positive even integer greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `False`.
- In certain unspecified conditions, the function returns `False`.
- In more unspecified conditions, the function also returns `False`.
- If `num` is a prime number within the range of 2 to 1000, and it is not divisible by any integer `i` where 2 ≤ `i` ≤ √num, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number, returning `True` if it is and various `False` conditions otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `num` and returns `False` for numbers less than 2, even numbers, and under certain unspecified conditions, and returns `True` if `num` is a prime number within the range of 2 to 1000.**
