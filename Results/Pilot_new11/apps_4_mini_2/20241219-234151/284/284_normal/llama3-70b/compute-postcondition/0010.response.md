According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, we know `num` is a positive odd integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000. The loop initializes `i` at 2 and continues until `i` is greater than the integer value of the square root of `num`. 

The last value of `i` before the loop ends would be the integer part of the square root of `num`, which can be expressed as `int(num ** 0.5)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` has to be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. If `i` is at its maximum allowed value, which is `int(num ** 0.5)`, the next increment would make `i` equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

Thus, if the loop is to execute one more time, we need to have:

- `i` incremented to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given that `num` is a positive odd integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `num` must remain unchanged.

State: **`num` is a positive odd integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `i` is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`**
