According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the calculation involving `num`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `num` is a positive odd integer between 4 and 1000. 

To find the maximum value for `i` in the next iteration, we should calculate `int(num ** 0.5)`. Since `num` is at least 4 but can be as large as 1000, the maximum value of `int(num ** 0.5)` is 31 (which occurs when `num` is 1000, as `int(1000 ** 0.5)` equals 31.62, and we take the integer part).

Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3 in the next iteration. 

So, the state adjustments will be:
State: **`num` is a positive odd integer such that 4 ≤ `num` ≤ 1000, `i` is 3**
