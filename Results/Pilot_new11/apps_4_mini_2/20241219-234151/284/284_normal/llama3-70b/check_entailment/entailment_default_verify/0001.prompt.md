You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical flaw that can cause it to not find a suitable `m` even though a counterexample exists for the specified `n`.

Consider the structure of the program: it iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000, and for each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1`, checking if this result is not prime using the function `func_1`. However, the `func_1` is defined after it is used, which would lead to a `NameError` if executed as it is. Additionally, the output of the program lacks handling for the case where no non-prime numbers are found within the range, even though it is guaranteed that an answer exists.

For an explicit counterexample, when `n = 1`, the program checks:
- For `m = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime)
- For `m = 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime)
- For `m = 3`: `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (not prime - but the program will find this correctly). 

However, since the function `func_1` is called before it is defined, it will raise an error rather than returning any result for larger tests. Thus, by Python's rules, this results in a failure to execute correctly.

To summarize: the program will not work correctly in any case due to the placement of `func_1` and can malfunction based on the input values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range of 1 to 1000. It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, as these values are not considered prime. Additionally, the function checks divisibility of `num` by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is found to be divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not prime. If `num` passes all checks, the function returns `True`, confirming that `num` is a prime number. However, the function lacks explicit handling for even numbers greater than 2, which are automatically not prime, meaning the returned value for such cases is left unspecified. In summary, the function effectively identifies if `num` is a prime number but does not account for all even numbers greater than 2 distinctly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
