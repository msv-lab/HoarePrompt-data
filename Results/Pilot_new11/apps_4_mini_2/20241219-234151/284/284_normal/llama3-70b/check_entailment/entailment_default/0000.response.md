The provided program aims to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, thereby disproving PolandBall's hypothesis. The function used to check for prime numbers works by confirming that \( num \) (which is \( n \cdot m + 1 \)) is greater than 1 and checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \( num \).

Let's evaluate the code step by step:

1. The outer loop iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
2. For each \( m \), it calculates \( num = n \cdot m + 1 \).
3. It checks if \( num \) is not prime using `func_1()`.
4. If `func_1(num)` returns `False`, indicating \( num \) is not prime, the program prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

### Output hints analysis:
The output hints correctly describe the functionality of `func_1()`, noting its checks for primality, including its early return for numbers less than 2 and the loop for checking divisibility. However, it highlights that the function does not uniquely check for even numbers greater than 2. 

The hint's statement that "the function lacks explicit handling for even numbers greater than 2" does suggest a possible oversight. Specifically, the function will incorrectly treat even numbers greater than 2 as potentially prime due to the design of its checks. 

### Key Case:
Consider the scenario when \( n = 1 \):
- For \( m = 1 \): \( num = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2 \) (which is prime).
- For \( m = 2 \): \( num = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \) (also prime).
- ...
- For \( m = 4 \): \( num = 1 \cdot 4 + 1 = 5 \) (prime).
- Continuing this gives only primes until \( m = 6 \) where \( num = 1 \cdot 6 + 1 = 7 \) (prime).

Eventually, all numbers generated from this approach will only yield primes until we reach \( m = 3 \) which will yield \( 4 \): \( n \cdot 3 + 1 = 4 \), which is actually non-prime. 

However, errors can arise on trying values of \( n \) (like if \( n = 2 \) or odd numbers) leading to potential cases where m values that generate an even output greater than 2 will not be identified correctly as non-prime.

### Conclusion:
The core of the issue lies in the prime-checking function, where it does not distinctly identify that any even number greater than 2 must be classified as non-prime. Thereby, this oversight could lead to the program inadvertently missing some valid outputs where it could have returned a non-prime less than 1000, thus not following the problem requirements correctly for every case. 

Correctness: **False**.
