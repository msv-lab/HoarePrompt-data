The variable `col` is assigned the value of `m - remaining_steps`. The initial state provides that `m` is an integer within the range [2, 10^9] and does not provide an explicit value for `remaining_steps`. Thus, we cannot specify the exact value of `col` without knowing `remaining_steps`. 

However, we can still describe how `col` relates to the existing variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`; `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`, and `full_rows` is an odd integer; `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is an odd integer; `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.**
