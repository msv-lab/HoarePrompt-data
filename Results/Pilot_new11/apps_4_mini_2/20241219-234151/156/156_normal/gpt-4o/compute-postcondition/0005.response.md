`remaining_steps` is assigned the value of `k % (m - 1)`, which calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `m - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`; `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`; `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`**.
