The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an even integer between 2 and 10^9; `m`, an integer between 2 and 10^9; and `k`, a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < n·m. It performs the following actions: If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it updates `k` by subtracting `n - 1`, calculates how many full rows are crossed using `(m - 1)`, and determines the remaining steps across the columns. The function then derives the `row` and `col` coordinates based on the parity of `full_rows`. It finally prints these coordinates `(row, col)`, which will have valid bounds derived from the calculations based on `k`. Potential edge cases include handling maximum values of `k`, ensuring the calculations remain valid within the specified ranges, and the guarantee that `n` is even and `k` is non-negative. The function guarantees valid outputs for the conditions specified.
