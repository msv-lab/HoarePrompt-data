To verify the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the structure and logic of the code carefully.

### Problem Recap:
Lara starts at the top-left corner of a grid (1, 1), moves straight down to the bottom-left corner (n, 1), and then moves in a zig-zag (snake-like) manner until she has made `k` moves. We need to determine her current position after `k` moves in a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:

1. **Input Processing:**
   ```python
   input = sys.stdin.read
   data = input().strip().split()
   (n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
   ```
   - The input is read and processed correctly into three integers: `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Function Logic:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, m, k):
       if (k < n - 1):
           print(k + 1, 1)
       else:
           k -= n - 1
           full_rows = k // (m - 1)
           remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
           if (full_rows % 2 == 0):
               row = n - full_rows
               col = 2 + remaining_steps
           else:
               row = n - full_rows
               col = m - remaining_steps
           print(row, col)
   ```

3. **Movement Logic:**
   - If `k < n - 1`, Lara has not yet left the first column; thus her position is straightforward at `(k + 1, 1)`.
   - When `k >= n - 1`, she has reached the bottom of the first column and starts to move right. The program then calculates:
     - `full_rows` as the number of complete horizontal movements she has made after reaching the last cell of the first column.
     - `remaining_steps` as the positions she moves from her current row.

4. **Row and Column Calculation:**
   - The calculation for `row` and `col` correctly handles the switching direction after every full row movement, determining if the current completed Move is an even or odd row.

### Validation of Outputs:
- The results from the function properly adhere to the conditions of the problem statement. The `if` sections accurately lead to the correct position based on how many cells Lara has moved (`k`).

### Conclusion:
Given the logic checks out with the rule of movement in the dungeon as stated in the problem description, I conclude that the code correctly calculates the position of Lara after `k` movements.

**Correctness: True**
