You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Movement Description**:
   - Lara starts at the cell (1, 1).
   - Moves downward to (n, 1).
   - Then, she moves in a snake-like pattern:
     - Moves to the right until the end of the row, then goes one cell up, moves to the left in the next row, and repeat.

2. **Input Constraints**:
   - n and m can be large, up to \(10^9\).
   - k can be very large, but less than \(n \cdot m\).
   - n is always even.

3. **Output**:
   - After moving k times, print the cell position (row, column).

### Code Analysis
The program attempts to calculate the final position based on k and the patterns established:

1. **Downward Movement**: The first `n - 1` movements are clearly defined as moving from (1,1) to (n,1). This is correctly handled by checking if `k < n - 1`, in which case `print(k + 1, 1)` correctly outputs Lara's position in the first column.

2. **Snake Movement Handling**:
   - If k is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program calculates the steps after reaching (n, 1).
   - The `full_rows` variable computes how many full "snake" rows Lara completed.
   - The `remaining_steps` computes the extra movement within the current row she reaches after `full_rows`.

3. **Row and Column Calculation**:
   - The program uses the parity of `full_rows` to determine whether she is finishing a row on the right side or left side of her movement.

### Potential Edge Cases
To validate whether the implementation covers all cases:
1. **Boundary Case 1**: When `k = 0`
   - Output should be (1, 1) → Correctly returns (1, 1).

2. **Boundary Case 2**: When `k = n - 1`
   - Lara should be at (n, 1) → The code handles this correctly.

3. **Boundary Case 3**: When `k = n + (m - 1)` (one full "snake" left movement)
   - This should return (n - 1, 2) → We need to check how the `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` handle this case.

### Issue Found
When we consider larger values for `k`, especially near boundaries:

- Let's consider `n = 4, m = 3, k = 10`.
- Following the pattern:
  - Down: (1, 1) to (4, 1) [k=3]
  - Right (4,2) (4,3) → (3,3) [k=7]
  - Left (3,2) → [k=10]
- The current code fails to correctly calculate positions for large k values because `full_rows % 2 == 0` or odd parity may not be sufficient for how `k` incrementally makes position jumps in the grid-based movement.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to erroneous outputs when k values push past certain limits or boundaries of the predetermined positions.

Thus, considering the above analysis and the discovered issues:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`. If `full_rows` is an even non-negative integer, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is even, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is an odd integer, then `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`, which is odd, and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the printed values are `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n·m`; the values printed for `row` and `col` are determined by the evenness of `full_rows`, with `row` as `n - full_rows` and `col` based on `remaining_steps`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an even integer between 2 and 10^9; `m`, an integer between 2 and 10^9; and `k`, a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` < n·m. It performs the following actions: If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it updates `k` by subtracting `n - 1`, calculates how many full rows are crossed using `(m - 1)`, and determines the remaining steps across the columns. The function then derives the `row` and `col` coordinates based on the parity of `full_rows`. It finally prints these coordinates `(row, col)`, which will have valid bounds derived from the calculations based on `k`. Potential edge cases include handling maximum values of `k`, ensuring the calculations remain valid within the specified ranges, and the guarantee that `n` is even and `k` is non-negative. The function guarantees valid outputs for the conditions specified.
