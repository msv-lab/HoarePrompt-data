The function accepts two positive integers, `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The calculation is performed using the Euclidean algorithm, which involves repeatedly replacing `x` and `y` with `y` and `x % y`, respectively, until `y` becomes 0. The final returned value of `x` is effectively the GCD of the initial inputs. The function does not handle the scenario where either `x` or `y` is zero or negative, which could lead to undefined behavior or exceptions if such inputs are provided. Therefore, it is assumed that valid positive integers are always supplied.
