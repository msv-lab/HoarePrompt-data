You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze it thoroughly. 

The program is designed to calculate the sum of distinct integers that a frog can reach given two jump parameters (a and b) and an upper limit (m). The key aspects to verify include:

1. **Understanding distinct integers reachable**: As described, the frog can jump either forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The function `func_2` is implemented to calculate how many distinct integers the frog can reach in the range [0, m].

2. **Implementation of the gcd condition**: The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `g` (the GCD) is different from 1, the problem is reduced by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`. The implementation checks that the problem is simplified correctly.

3. **Calculating sums**: There are two main cases:
   - If `m < k` (where `k` is defined as `a + b - 1`), the distinct integers are simply counted as from 0 to m, which is correctly calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - If `m >= k`, it calculates the total sum of integers reachable in two parts: first for the range governed by `k` and then for the remaining integers up to `m`.

Examining the edge cases and potential issues:
- **Case of zero jumps**: If both `a` and `b` are larger than `m`, the sums would not yield any distinct integers that the frog can reach outside 0.
- **Negative and low values**: Ensuring that when `m`, `a`, and `b` are set to lower edge values, such as when `m` equals 0 or 1.

Testing specific cases for correctness:
- **When `m = 0, a = 1, b = 1`**: The result should be `1`, as the frog can only reach 0.
- **When `m = 1, a = 1, b = 1`**: The result should also yield `2`, as the frog can reach both 0 and 1.
- **When `m` is large but `a` and `b` are set to boundary values like `a = 1, b = 2019`**: The frog can jump in a predictable manner and should not miss any reachable integers.

After considering the provided coding logic, looking at edge cases, and analyzing specific scenarios where it might fail to adhere to certain conditions, I did not find any particular case where it fails to compute `f(i)` accurately or returns an incorrect sum due to the jumps proposed.

Thus, since the logic holds for the potential input values, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the requirements from the problem statement through its recursive and arithmetic logic.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a positive integer, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers. It performs the following operations based on the relations between these inputs: 

1. It first computes the value `g` as the output of `func_1(a, b)`. If `g` is not equal to 1, it recursively calls itself with new parameters `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, returning the product of this recursive call and `g`.

2. If `g` equals 1, it sets `k` as `a + b - 1`. The function then checks if `m` is less than `k`. If `m` is less than `k`, it returns the sum of the first `m` positive integers computed using the formula `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`.

3. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates `sum_k` and `sum_m`, where `sum_k` is the sum of the first `k` integers and `sum_m` is the sum of integers from `k` to `m`. It returns the sum of these two calculated values.

This function effectively computes specific summations based on the integer inputs while also handling a recursion case based on the output from `func_1`, which is crucial for deriving `g`. Edge cases such as when `m` is less than `k` are explicitly handled, and the recursive nature of the function ensures it can deal with larger values of `m`, `a`, and `b` in inputs while ultimately returning numerical sums tailored to the given conditions.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
