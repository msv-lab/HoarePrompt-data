To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze it thoroughly. 

The program is designed to calculate the sum of distinct integers that a frog can reach given two jump parameters (a and b) and an upper limit (m). The key aspects to verify include:

1. **Understanding distinct integers reachable**: As described, the frog can jump either forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The function `func_2` is implemented to calculate how many distinct integers the frog can reach in the range [0, m].

2. **Implementation of the gcd condition**: The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `g` (the GCD) is different from 1, the problem is reduced by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`. The implementation checks that the problem is simplified correctly.

3. **Calculating sums**: There are two main cases:
   - If `m < k` (where `k` is defined as `a + b - 1`), the distinct integers are simply counted as from 0 to m, which is correctly calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - If `m >= k`, it calculates the total sum of integers reachable in two parts: first for the range governed by `k` and then for the remaining integers up to `m`.

Examining the edge cases and potential issues:
- **Case of zero jumps**: If both `a` and `b` are larger than `m`, the sums would not yield any distinct integers that the frog can reach outside 0.
- **Negative and low values**: Ensuring that when `m`, `a`, and `b` are set to lower edge values, such as when `m` equals 0 or 1.

Testing specific cases for correctness:
- **When `m = 0, a = 1, b = 1`**: The result should be `1`, as the frog can only reach 0.
- **When `m = 1, a = 1, b = 1`**: The result should also yield `2`, as the frog can reach both 0 and 1.
- **When `m` is large but `a` and `b` are set to boundary values like `a = 1, b = 2019`**: The frog can jump in a predictable manner and should not miss any reachable integers.

After considering the provided coding logic, looking at edge cases, and analyzing specific scenarios where it might fail to adhere to certain conditions, I did not find any particular case where it fails to compute `f(i)` accurately or returns an incorrect sum due to the jumps proposed.

Thus, since the logic holds for the potential input values, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the requirements from the problem statement through its recursive and arithmetic logic.
