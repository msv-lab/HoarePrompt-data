Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately evaluates the provided program against the problem description. The function `func_2` correctly calculates the distinct integers reachable by the frog with jumps of `a` and `b`, given the constraints of the problem. The annotations provide clarity on the flow of data and the structure of the code, reinforcing that the implementation handles various edge cases effectively.

Key points supporting the correctness include:

1. **Understanding Distinct Jumps**: The program explicitly captures the condition for reducing the inputs based on the GCD of `a` and `b`, ensuring that the problem can be simplified without loss of generality.

2. **Distinct Sums for Two Cases**: The conditions in `func_2` cover scenarios where `m` is either less than or greater than `k`, allowing proper calculation of the sum of reachable integers.

3. **Recursion & Base Cases**: The recursive call structure effectively handles potential large values of `m`, while ensuring each recursive step adheres to the constraints of the problem.

The annotations further clarify that the program is written under the assumption of valid inputs (positive integers), which is aligned with the problem statement's constraints. Thus, the implementation aligns with the expectations for inputs and produces correct results based on the specified requirements.

Hence, the program is confirmed to meet the problem description requirements and the reasoning presented in the assessment stands correct.
