To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the program step by step in accordance with the problem's requirements:

### Problem Summary
The problem requires the function `f(x)` to calculate the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on the number line from position `0` using two types of jumps: 
- Jumping forward to `k + a`
- Jumping backward to `k - b`

In addition, the function needs to compute the sum `âˆ‘ f(i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `m`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input and Initialization**: The program takes three integers, `m`, `a`, and `b`, which meet the specified constraints.

2. **Function `func_1(x, y)`**: This calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function itself seems sound but isn't explicitly needed for understanding `f(x)`.

3. **Function `func_2(m, a, b)`**:
   - It first calculates `g = func_1(a, b)` and checks if `g != 1`. 
   - If `g != 1`, it makes a recursive call to `func_2` using reduced values of `m`, `a`, and `b` divided by `g`. This process seems to normalize the inputs before further calculations.

4. **Distinct Integer Count Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `m < k`, where `k = a + b - 1`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` integers, which corresponds to the number of distinct integers from `0` to `m`, since the frog can potentially reach all integers in this range.
   - If `m >= k`, it computes:
     - `sum_k`: The sum of the first `k` integers.
     - `sum_m`: The sum of the first `m` integers minus the contributions from integers that are not reachable when `m` is larger than `k`.

### Correctness Evaluation
The main point is whether the calculation accurately reflects the number of distinct integers reachable by following the frog's jumping rules and appropriately sums this count over the specified range.

1. The case when `g != 1` effectively simplifies the jumping strategy by scaling down the problem. This is useful but does not lose the core computational ability.

2. The check for `m < k` ensures it returns all integers reachable under simpler conditions.

3. The combination of `sum_k` and `sum_m` tries to account for the integers that can be reached and sums them, but the deduction involved may not adequately capture the distinct positioning based on jumps given to variable `b` and potential overlaps.

### Conclusion
The logic fails to accumulate the distinct integers effectively for all cases. For example, if `a` and `b` are such that jumps back and forth cover more than expected or certain integers are omitted erroneously.

Therefore, the program does not unfailingly meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
