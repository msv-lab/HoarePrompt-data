The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `m` is a positive integer that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), while `a` and `b` are also positive integers that satisfy \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).

The function operates based on the following cases:

- **Case 1**: If the function `func_1(a, b)` returns a value \(g\) that is not equal to 1, the function returns the result of `func_2` called with arguments \(m // g\), \(a // g\), and \(b // g\), multiplied by \(g\).

- **Case 2**: If \(m\) is less than \(k\), where \(k = a + b - 1\), the function returns the sum of the first \(m\) positive integers, calculated as \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\).

- **Case 3**: In other scenarios, the function returns the sum of \(sum_k\) and \(sum_m\), where \(sum_k = (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2\) and \(sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three positive integers \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\), and return a value based on the specified cases involving calculations of sums and recursive calls. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b, and returns results based on multiple cases involving integer calculations and conditions related to the inputs.**
