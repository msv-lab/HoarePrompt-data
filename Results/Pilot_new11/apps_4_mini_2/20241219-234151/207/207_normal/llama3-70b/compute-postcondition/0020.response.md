To determine the output state after all iterations of the provided loop have executed, we analyze the given initial conditions and the behavior of the loop code.

1. The loop iterates over every integer `i` from `0` to `m`, inclusively.
2. For each `i`, two conditional operations occur:
   - If `i + a <= m`, `dp[i + a]` is incremented by `dp[i]`.
   - If `i - b >= 0`, `dp[i]` is incremented by `dp[i - b]`.

Given the ranges of `m`, `a`, and `b`, every iteration processes the potential modifications to the `dp` list.

Throughout all iterations:
- The initial value of `dp[0]` remains `1`, and it contributes to other `dp` indices based on the conditions met.
- For all `i` values that fall within the specified bounds, the `dp` list accumulates counts based on combinations of `a` and `b`.

After considering all iterations:
- Since the non-negative nature of indices is maintained and `dp` could repeatedly propagate the counts based on whether conditions are met, each index in `dp` will reflect a cumulative count of ways to reach that index by either adding `a` or deducting `b`.

Therefore, the final output state captures the cumulative nature of `dp`:

Output State: **`m`, `a`, `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\). `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` using additions of `a` and subtractions of `b` from the starting index 0.**
