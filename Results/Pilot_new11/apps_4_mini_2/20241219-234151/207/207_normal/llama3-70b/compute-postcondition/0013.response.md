The code updates `dp[i]` by adding the value of `dp[i - b]` to it. The variables `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The effect of this operation is that `dp[i]` will now contain the old value of `dp[i]` plus the value from `dp[i - b]`. 

The initial state is:
- `m`, `a`, `b` remain the same.
- `dp[i]` gets updated.

Since we do not have specific values for `dp`, `i`, or the other variables, we will express the state in general terms but can specify that `dp[i]` will be updated.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, `b` remain the same; `dp[i]` is now equal to the old value of `dp[i]` plus `dp[i - b]`.**
