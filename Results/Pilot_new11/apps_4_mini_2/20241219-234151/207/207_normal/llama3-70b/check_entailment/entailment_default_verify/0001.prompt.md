You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to understand how the function `func` computes the values based on the frog's jumping capabilities.

### Review of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `dp` of size `m + 1` to store intermediate results, where `dp[i]` presumably counts the possible states the frog can reach (this is unclear since it's iterated differently in the looping).
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - The first loop goes through `0` to `m`.
   - It attempts to mark positions reachable by the frog if it jumps forward `a` steps, by adding `dp[i]` to `dp[i + a]`.
   - It also attempts to mark positions reachable by jumping backward `b` steps, but the backward jump logic appears to be incorrectly implemented. Specifically, it adds `dp[i - b]` to `dp[i]`, which does not align with how jump counts should propagate.

3. **Summation**: Finally, it sums all reachable positions counted in `dp`. 

### Flaws in Implementation:
- **Backward Jump Logic**: The expression `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` does not seem logical. If we're at position `i`, then jumping backward `b` should count towards positions already known, rather than incrementing `dp[i]` itself, which could lead to erroneous counts.
  
- **Boundary Cases**: There might be boundary cases where if `m` is large and `b` is small or large where this dynamic propagation fails to count the correct jump combinations effectively.

### Example Test Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Letâ€™s consider a simple test case where we apply `m = 5`, `a = 1`, and `b = 5`. 

1. For `f(0)`, the frog can only be at `0`, which is count `1`.
2. For `f(1)`, the frog can move to `1` (count `2`).
3. Up to `f(5)`, due to the incorrect calculation of positional jumps based on `b` and the way states are updated in `dp`, we won't reach some integers correctly.

From this example, we can see how the counts do not adhere to the defined operation based on the jumps in the problem, especially for small values where the backward jump would actually encapsulate additional states within the boundary `0` to `m`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of correctness in dynamic updates within the program and potential mishandling of the backward jump propagation, we can infer that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement effectively. 

Thus, the verdict on this program's correctness is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three positive integers `m`, `a`, and `b` from user input, where `m` can be as large as \(10^9\) and `a` and `b` can be up to \(10^5\). It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` with size `m + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` starting from index 0, by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`. The function iterates through the list updating the number of ways to reach each index according to the defined operations. After processing the list, it sums all the values in `dp` and prints this total, which represents the total number of ways to reach any index from 0 to `m` using the specified operations. Note that the function does not handle cases where `m` is very large since it allocates an array of size `m + 1`, which could lead to memory issues when `m` is close to its upper limit.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
