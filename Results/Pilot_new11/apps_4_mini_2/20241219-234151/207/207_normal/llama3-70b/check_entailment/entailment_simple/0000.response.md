Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description, which revolves around counting distinct integers that the frog can reach within the range `[0, x]` for each integer from `0` to `m`, and summing these counts.

Here’s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The use of a dynamic programming array, `dp`, attempts to calculate ways to reach each position, but it does not correctly compute the reachable integers as specified in the problem. `dp[i]` is incremented based on jumps forward (`i + a`) and backward (`i - b`), which does not reflect the concept of counting reachable distinct positions in the way `f(x)` requires.

2. **Increment Logic**: The line `dp[i - b]` modifies the current `dp[i]` based on previous positions, which does not correspond to the problem description. The goal is to calculate reachable integers distinctively, not based on the number of ways to reach certain positions.

3. **Output**: The final output summing the `dp` elements does not represent `∑ f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`. Instead, it incorrectly combines the number of ways to reach those positions, which is not the goal.

4. **Missing Distinct Counting**: The logic implemented does not ensure distinct counting of integers reached by the frog. Instead, it erroneously counts ways of arriving at positions, which does not align with how `f(i)` should be defined.

In summary, the provided function logic does not correctly compute `f(i)` as outlined in the problem description, and thus fails to achieve the correct output for some input cases. Therefore, a simple counting approach must be employed instead to calculate distinct reachable integers.
