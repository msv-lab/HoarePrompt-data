n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of sell-out days (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers (k_i, l_i), representing the number of products k_i (0 ≤ k_i) and the number of clients l_i (0 ≤ l_i) on the i-th day.
