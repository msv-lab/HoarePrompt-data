The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: 

1. `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
2. `f`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n).
3. `days`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two non-negative integers, `k_i` (representing the number of products) and `l_i` (representing the number of clients) for each of the `n` days (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9).

After executing the function body, it returns `total_sales`, which is computed as the previous `total_sales` plus the sum of the top `f` elements from `potential_sales_increase`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `f`, and a list of tuples `days`, and return the updated total sales based on the highest potential sales increases from selected days for sell-out. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (positive integer), f (non-negative integer), and days (list of tuples of non-negative integers), and returns the updated total_sales based on the sum of the top f potential sales increases.**
