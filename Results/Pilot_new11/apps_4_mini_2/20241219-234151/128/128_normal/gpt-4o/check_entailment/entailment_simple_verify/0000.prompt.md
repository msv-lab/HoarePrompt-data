You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. The program reads `n` (number of days) and `f` (number of days to double the product availability) along with `n` pairs of integers representing `k_i` (products available) and `l_i` (clients visiting).
2. It calculates the regular sales for each day, which is `min(k_i, l_i)`, and stores these in the `regular_sales` list.
3. The potential sales increase from doubling the products on selected days is calculated as `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` and stored in the `potential_sales_increase` list.
4. The total sales are computed by summing the `regular_sales` and adding the largest `f` values from the `potential_sales_increase` list.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases or scenarios where the program may fail:

- If `f` is zero, the program needs to ensure it does not attempt to add anything from `potential_sales_increase`.
- If `f` is greater than the number of days that can produce a sales increase (i.e., when `k_i == 0` for those specific `i`), the program might try to take more from `potential_sales_increase` than available.
- In the case where there are no clients (`l_i == 0`), the sales for that day should also be zero regardless of the products available.
- Let's consider a case where `k_i` is consistently equal to `l_i`. If all clients can buy their desired products, the potential sales increase for those days would be `0` because `min(2 * k_i, l_i)` will equal `min(k_i, l_i)`.

**Test Case Example:**
```
Input:
2 1
3 5
0 0

Expected Output:
5
```

This means on day 1, we can sell 3 products, but on day 2, we have 0 clients, so total sales will be 3. However, if we choose to double day 1's products, we can still sell only 3 because there are 5 clients total, which does not risk any sales loss. This will yield an output of 5 which is correctly computed.

However, if we input:
```
Input:
3 1
0 3
5 5
0 0
```
The total sales without a sell-out will be `0 + 5 + 0 = 5`. If we choose to double the first day products, the total sales would still be just `5` (since first day sees no effect because of no clients).

Considering all of the above cases and the logic therein, it appears that the logic of the program adheres to the problem statement correctly for the identified edge cases and regular cases without any obvious discrepancies. 

Thus, the output should be as follows:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly computes the maximal number of products sold according to the described requirements, handling edge cases appropriately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of products and the number of clients on each of the n days, respectively.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples; `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum values of `k_i` and `l_i` for each tuple in `days`; `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the increments calculated as `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is the previous total_sales plus the sum of the top f elements from potential_sales_increase.
