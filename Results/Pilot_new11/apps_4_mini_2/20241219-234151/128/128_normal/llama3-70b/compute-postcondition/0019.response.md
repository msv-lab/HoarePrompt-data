Postcondition: ***`days` is a list of `n` tuples sorted by the difference `l - k`, `sold` is equal to `min(days[0][0] * 2, days[0][1])` if `i < f` with `i` initially set to 0, otherwise `sold` is equal to `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` with `i` being greater than or equal to `f`. In both cases, `n` must be greater than 0.***
