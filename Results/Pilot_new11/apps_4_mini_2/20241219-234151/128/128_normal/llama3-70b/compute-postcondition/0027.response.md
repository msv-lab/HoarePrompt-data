Postcondition: ***`days` is a list of `n` tuples sorted by the difference `l - k`, where `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is `n`. If `i < f`, `sold` is updated to `sold + min(days[n - 1][0] * 2, days[n - 1][1])`. Otherwise, if `n` is a valid index, `sold` is updated to `sold_initial + min(days[n][0], days[n][1])`; if not, an error occurs.***
