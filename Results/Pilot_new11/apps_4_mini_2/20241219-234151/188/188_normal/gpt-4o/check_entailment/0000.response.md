Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for determining if Petya and Vasya can have a fair game. Specifically, the problem states that the game is considered fair if each player can take an equal number of cards, but the implementation assumes that for the game to be fair, there must be exactly two distinct values with each appearing `n // 2` times. However, the game can still be fair with other configurations of the card values.

For example:
1. If the input is:
   ```
   4
   1
   1
   2
   2
   ```
   The program would return "NO" because it checks for exactly two unique numbers both appearing twice, but the game can still be fair with Petya choosing `1` and Vasya choosing `2`.

2. Another failing case is:
   ```
   6
   1
   1
   1
   2
   2
   2
   ```
   Here, there are three `1`s and three `2`s. The program would return "NO" but it is actually possible for the game to be fair (Petya chooses `1`, Vasya chooses `2`).

In both cases, there exists a scenario where the game can be fair, but the program fails to recognize it. This indicates a logical flaw in evaluations of fairness. Therefore, the response should be "False".
