The code snippet `n = int(input())` prompts the user for input and assigns an integer value to the variable `n`. Initially, `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100. As a result, `n` will retain its status as an integer within this range based on user input. However, it may change if the input provided by the user is a different even integer within the specified bounds. Other variables like the integers on the cards remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (as defined by the user input).**
