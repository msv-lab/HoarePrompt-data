The function `func` does not have any parameters that are passed directly when calling the function. Instead, it operates on a predefined input: `n`, which is an even integer between 2 and 100, and an array of `n` integers (each ranging from 1 to 100) representing numbers on cards. 

Based on the provided outputs and functionality, the function processes these inputs to return some result. However, the exact details of that result are not specified in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality description should include that the function does involve processing these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts predefined input where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, and there are `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing numbers on cards, and it returns a result based on these inputs.**
