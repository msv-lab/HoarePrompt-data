The code snippet `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list named `cycle`. However, the value of `x` is not defined in the initial state. None of the other variables have been modified by this code. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific impact on `cycle`, since it depends on the undefined value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is a list containing the value of `x` (which is undefined), visited[1] is True**
