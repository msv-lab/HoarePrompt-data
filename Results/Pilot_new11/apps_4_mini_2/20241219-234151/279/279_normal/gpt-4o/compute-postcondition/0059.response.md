Output State: **`visited[x]` is True for all values of `x` in `cycle`, `cycle` contains a sequence generated from starting at 2 and following the `p` mapping until a visited node is encountered, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the loop will terminate once a previously visited index is encountered. The final value of `x` will be the first previously visited index minus 1.**
