The statement `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Since there is no information provided about the previous state of the list `cycle`, we cannot assume its contents. However, the values of the other variables remain unchanged as the operation does not affect them.

The output state reflects that `x` has been added to `cycle`, while the other variables retain their original values. The relevant part of the output state is that `visited[x]` remains True, and `visited[i]` is still not True. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `visited[i]` is not True, `visited[x]` is True, and `x` has been added to `cycle`.**
