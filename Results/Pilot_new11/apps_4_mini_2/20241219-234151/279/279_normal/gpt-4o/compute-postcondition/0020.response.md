The code `visited[x] = True` assigns the value `True` to the `visited[x]` variable. In the initial state, it is indicated that `visited[x]` is currently `not True`. Therefore, after executing the code, `visited[x]` will now become `True`. 

The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged, while the state of `visited[i]` stays the same since there has been no assignment affecting it. 

The critical change is that `visited[x]` is now `True`, which satisfies the condition that `visited[x]` must be adjusted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `visited[i]` is not True, `visited[x]` is True**.
