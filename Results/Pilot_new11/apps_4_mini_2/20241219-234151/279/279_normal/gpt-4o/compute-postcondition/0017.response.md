`cycle` becomes `cycle` with the value of `x` appended to it. The value of `x` is `p[0] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `visited[i]` is not True, `visited[x]` is True, `cycle` is a list containing 0 and `p[0] - 1`, `x` is equal to `p[0] - 1`**
