Postcondition: ***`visited` is a list of n True values, `cycles` contains all unique cycles detected in the permutation defined by `p`, `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer, `no_reverse_components` is the sum of boolean conditions for all cycles in `cycles`, and the length of `cycles` is not equal to 1 (i.e., there are either no cycles or multiple cycles).***
