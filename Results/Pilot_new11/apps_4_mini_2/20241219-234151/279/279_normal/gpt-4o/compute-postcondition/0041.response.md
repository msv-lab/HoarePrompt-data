Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` contains the values of `x` encountered throughout the iterations of the loop, `visited` is updated such that all indices visited during the loop are marked True, and `x` is set to the value of `p[x] - 1` on the last iteration, which must have been a previously unvisited index. If there are no further unvisited indices in `p`, the loop terminates.**
