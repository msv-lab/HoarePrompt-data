The code `cycle.append(x)` will append the current value of `x` to the `cycle` list. Given that `x` is initialized to 0, the value appended to `cycle` will be 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `cycle` list containing the newly appended value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, the value of `visited[i]` is not True, `visited[x]` is True, `cycle` is a list containing 0, `x` is 0**
