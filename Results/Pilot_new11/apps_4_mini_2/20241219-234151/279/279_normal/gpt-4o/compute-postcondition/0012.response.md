The code assigns the value `True` to `visited[x]`. The variables `n`, `i`, `cycle`, and `x` remain unchanged in this operation. The value of `visited[i]` as not `True` is still valid, but now `visited[x]` has been set to `True`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, the value of `visited[i]` is not True, `visited[x]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 0**
