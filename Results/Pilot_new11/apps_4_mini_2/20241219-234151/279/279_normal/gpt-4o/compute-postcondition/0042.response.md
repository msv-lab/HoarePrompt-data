Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` contains the values of `x` encountered throughout the iterations of the loop, `visited` is updated such that all indices visited during the loop are marked True, `x` is set to the value of `p[x] - 1` on the last iteration, and `cycles` now contains all previous cycles plus the current `cycle`.**
