In the provided Python code snippet, the variable `ans` is updated by adding 1 to its previous value. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `p` is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`
- `b` is a list of zeros and ones with length `n`
- `ans` is initially 2
- `i` is 1

The relevant information regarding the condition is:
- If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is updated to 3; otherwise, `ans` remains 2. However, this condition does not affect the execution of the code provided, as it only modifies `ans` in scenarios not represented in the current code.

Before executing the code:
- `ans` = 2 

After executing the code:
- `ans` is updated to 2 + 1 = 3.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` but retains the context of other variables as they are not modified by the code itself.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of zeros and ones with length `n`; `ans` is 3; `i` is 1.**
