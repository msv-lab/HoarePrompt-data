According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the total number of iterations determined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. 

After the last iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1. The loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

As a result, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The state must be updated to reflect this change. Additionally, `p` and `b` remain unchanged, and `ans` also remains 2. 

However, the condition stated also mentions that for `i = 0`, `b[i]` is 0. For the next iteration where `i = 1`, we need to ensure the state reflects it accurately but we do not have any constraints regarding `b[1]` given in the current information.

Therefore, the states should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers of zeros and ones with length `n`, `ans` is 2, and `i` is 1**.
