Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of zeros and ones with length `n`, `ans` is initially 2 and `i` is 1. If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is updated to 3; otherwise, `ans` remains 2.***
