Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly handles cases where the scoop size `r` is equal to the dimensions of the pond `n` or `m`. In such cases, the possible positions for the scoop-net would be zero (`(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1) = 0`), which leads to a division by zero error when calculating the expected number of caught fishes. 

For example, if we input `n = 3, m = 3, r = 3, k = 3`, the calculations would be:
- The total positions for the scoop is `(3 - 3 + 1) * (3 - 3 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`, which is not zero, so it doesnâ€™t lead to an issue.
But if we input `n = 2, m = 2, r = 2, k = 1`, then:
- The total positions would be `(2 - 2 + 1) * (2 - 2 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`, and would yield `ans = 1 / 1 = 1.0000000000`, which works.
Yet, if we have `n = 3, m = 5, r = 3, k = 2`, the total possible positions becomes `0`, leading to a division by `0` when computing the expected value.

The logic to output the expected number of caught fishes is flawed as it does not consider dividing by zero in cases where the paddle is equal to the pond dimensions. Hence, the program is incorrect for these edge cases.
