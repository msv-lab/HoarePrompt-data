You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and calculations within the code.

```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n`: Number of rows in the pond.
   - `m`: Number of columns in the pond.
   - `r`: Size of the scoop (it is a square r x r).
   - `k`: Number of fishes to be placed.

2. **Key Operations:**
   - The program calculates the number of positions where the scoop can be placed, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. This gives all possible top-left corners for the scoop.
   - `ans` takes the minimum of `k` and the number of scoop positions. This would represent the maximum number of fishes that can be effectively caught in any single scoop position given what the scoop can encompass versus how many fishes are placed.

3. **Expected Number of Caught Fishes:**
   - The number of fishes that can be caught with equal probability across all valid positions of the scoop is then output as `ans` divided by the number of possible scoop positions.

### Issues with the Code:
- The logic does not correctly place the fishes in a manner to maximize the expectation of being caught, which is the main requirement of the problem. It merely divides the number of fishes that can be present within the scoop by the total number of positions without ensuring those fishes are optimally placed.
- For example, consider the input `1 1 1 1`. The scoop can only be placed once and will always catch the fish. The output should be `1.0000000000`, but the program currently outputs `1.0000000000`, which is correct. However, as soon as the problem gets larger (e.g., `5 5 1 25`), the output may not align with an optimal placement effort.
  
### Test Input for Misalignment:
Let’s consider a case where n=5, m=5, r=2, and k=8 (fishes placed).
```plaintext
Input: 5 5 2 8 
```
- The expected maximum number of fish caught when the scoop is used randomly could very likely be higher than the logic implemented (places fished out diluted across areas).
- The calculation does not provide optimal coverage and works with a too simplistic approach, leading to incorrect expectations.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not optimize the placement of fishes according to the conditions of the problem, and can thus yield incorrect results in various scenarios, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, r, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 100000).
def func():
    n, m, r, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
