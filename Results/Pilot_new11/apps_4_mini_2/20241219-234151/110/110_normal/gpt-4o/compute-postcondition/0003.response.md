In the provided code snippet, we are using the `heapq.heappush` function to add an element to the `heap` list. The element being pushed into the heap is a tuple consisting of `-coverage(x, y)`, `x`, and `y`. 

Initially, we have:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (no specific value provided)
- `m` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1 (no specific value provided)
- `r` is a positive integer (no specific value provided)
- `k` is a positive integer (no specific value provided)
- `heap` is an empty list
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0

The result of `coverage(x, y)` would depend on the implementation of the `coverage` function, which is unknown at this point. Assuming that it returns a value that can be computed based on `x` and `y`, the tuple that is being pushed into `heap` will be formed. 

Since neither `x` nor `y` are modified by the operation, and `heap` is initially empty, we will conclude that `heap` will now contain a single element represented as `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`.

Therefore, the output state, reflecting the current state of the variables and maintaining the initial constraints where possible, is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains one element: (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), `x` is 0, `y` is 0**.
