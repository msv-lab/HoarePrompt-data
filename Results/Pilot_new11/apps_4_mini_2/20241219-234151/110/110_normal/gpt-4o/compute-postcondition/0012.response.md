According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and the value of `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `y` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 1. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `y` will need to be incremented by 1 to 1. For the loop to continue executing, `m` must be greater than this new value of `y`, which is now 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m + 1` elements: (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), ..., (-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1), (-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0), `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
