#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the pond, r is a positive integer indicating the size of the scoop-net, and k is a positive integer representing the number of fishes to be placed in distinct cells of the pond, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5).
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []

        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `n * m` elements; `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is `m - 1`.
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        total_coverage -= cov
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `n * m - 3 * k` elements, `total_coverage` is equal to `-sum of the first k cov values.`
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions
    #The program returns the value of total_coverage divided by total_positions, where total_coverage is equal to -sum of the first k cov values and total_positions is calculated as (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four positive integer parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. It computes the total coverage from the top `k` coverage values extracted from a min-heap built from all positions in an `n x m` pond (where coverage is assumed to be evaluated by a function `coverage(x, y)` not defined in the provided code). The function then returns the ratio of this total coverage to the number of valid positions available for placing a scoop-net of size `r` within the pond. Specifically, the number of valid positions is calculated as `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. Edge cases such as `k` being larger than the total number of positions or `r` being equal to or greater than `n` or `m` are not handled, which may lead to division by zero or invalid heap operations. Moreover, if `k` exceeds the number of available coverage values, the behavior of the function is undefined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the scoop-net within the pond, n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the pond such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000, and r is an integer representing the size of the scoop-net such that 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #The program returns the area of the scoop-net in the pond, calculated as the product of two dimensions defined by the coordinates (x, y), the size of the scoop-net (r), and the dimensions of the pond (n, m). The formula evaluates how the scoop-net fits within the pond boundaries based on these values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `coverage` calculates the area of a scoop-net based on its coordinates `(x, y)` within a rectangular pond defined by dimensions `(n, m)`, and a size parameter `r`. It computes how much of the scoop-net fits within the boundaries of the pond, ensuring that it does not exceed the pond's dimensions. The function calculates this by determining the effective width and height that the scoop-net can occupy given the parameters, and returns the product of these dimensions. If the scoop-net is completely out of bounds, it could potentially return a negative or zero area due to the calculation method, indicating an edge case where the scoop-net does not fit at all. Overall, it assumes the parameters `n`, `m`, and `r` are defined globally or are present elsewhere in the code, as they are not passed as arguments and their states are essential for the calculation.
