Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `i` is the next index after the current `i`; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `additional_marks` contains at least 4 elements with the new element `i + j`, if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and it is not already in `marks`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
