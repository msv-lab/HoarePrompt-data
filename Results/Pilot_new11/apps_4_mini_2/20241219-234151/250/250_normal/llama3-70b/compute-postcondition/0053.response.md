Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range [4, 100000]; `i` is 2; `j` is 3; `need_x` is True; `need_y` is True or False; `marks` is the same as the initial set of integers from the input. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, the conditions for `n`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and `marks` remain unchanged.***
