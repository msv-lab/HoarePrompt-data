The code `print(len(additional_marks))` executes a print statement that outputs the length of the `additional_marks` list. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged throughout this execution. The relevant detail here is that `len(additional_marks)` calculates the number of elements in the list `additional_marks`.

Since we don't modify the contents of `additional_marks` or any other variables in the provided code, we only need to specify the output of the length calculation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `marks` is unchanged and contains at least `n` elements; the length of `additional_marks` is printed.**
