According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 1 for the next iteration. 

Since `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, for `i` to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the marks on the ruler with `a[0]` being 0 and `a[n-1]` being `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `need_x` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, otherwise it is False, `need_y` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, otherwise it is False, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n-1`**
