To determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute, we first need to assess the key variables involved in the `for` loop construct. The loop iterates over `additional_marks`. 

The current state before the loop starts is as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100000\);
- `l` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\);
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\);
- `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the marks on the ruler, where \(a[0] = 0\) and \(a[n-1] = l\);
- `marks` is a set of integers from the input which must contain at least 1 integer;
- `need_y` is False, which implies `need_x` is also False;
- `i` is \(n-1\);
- `j` is \(n-1\);
- `additional_marks` includes the integers `x` and `y`, with `y` appended to `additional_marks`.

To execute the loop:
1. We need to ensure that the `additional_marks` collection contains at least one element. In this scenario, while `x` and `y` are explicitly included in `additional_marks`, there is no indication that they are the only integers; it is possible that other integers exist based on the state of the input.
2. Given the context, if `additional_marks` was initialized to only include values from `x` and `y`, we should confirm it is non-empty.

Since `additional_marks` includes at least `x` and `y`, which are positive integers, the state is valid.

However, to clarify the loop's execution conditions further:
- The variable `j` should not need adjustment because it is already using the last index of the `additional_marks`.

Thus, the states need no explicit changes if we assume `additional_marks` indeed contains values to iterate over. 

Therefore, the answer is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l,  `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `additional_marks` contains at least the integers `x` and `y`**
