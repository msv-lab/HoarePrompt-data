According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `additional_marks` list. It will execute once for each integer in the `additional_marks`. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least the integers `x`, `y`, and possibly others.

Since the loop iterates over `additional_marks`, to determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `j`. Assuming `j` is the last integer in `additional_marks`, the next value of `j` would be the next integer in the `additional_marks` collection. 

If there are more integers in `additional_marks` beyond the current index `j`, then `j` will assume that next value for the loop to execute one more time. 

Therefore, the state can be adjusted to include the next integer in `additional_marks` accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, and `additional_marks` must contain more integers for the loop to execute again, `j` is the next value in `additional_marks`.**
