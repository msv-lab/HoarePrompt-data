To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we analyze the behavior of the loop within the given constraints:

1. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer constrained between 2 and 100000, `l` is a positive integer constrained between 2 and 10^9, each of `x` and `y` fall within 1 to `l` while being distinct (`1 <= x < y <= l`), `i` represents the next index after the current `i`, and `marks` contains at least `n` elements.

2. The loop iterates over `additional_marks`, and during each iteration, it checks if `i + j` (where `j` is the current element of `additional_marks`) is less than or equal to `l` and not already contained in `marks`. If both conditions are satisfied, it appends `i + j` to `additional_marks`.

3. If the loop executes multiple times, each time:
   - `additional_marks` will contain at least one more element (`i + j`), where this condition holds true.
   - The process will continue until no more values can be added due to `i + j` exceeding `l` or `i + j` being present in `marks`.

Considering these points, let's deduce the final output state after all iterations of the loop:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `i` is the next index after the current `i`; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `additional_marks` is updated to include all unique values of `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks` after all iterations, or remains unchanged if no value meets the criteria.**
