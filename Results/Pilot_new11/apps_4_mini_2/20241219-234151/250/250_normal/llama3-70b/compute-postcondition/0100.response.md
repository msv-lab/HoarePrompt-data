According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `additional_marks` contains at least `n + 1` elements, and the last element that was added is `i + j`. 

To execute the loop again, we should expect the next value of `j` to be the next element in `additional_marks`, which would indicate that there is at least one more element than the previous one. 

Since `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`, this suggests that there may be constraints tied to the values of `i`, `j`, and `marks`.

As `j` is being iterated over `additional_marks`, to execute the loop one more time, the next value of `j` should be from `additional_marks`, thus, we can increment the index to access the next element in the list. 

Assuming the current length of `additional_marks` is at least `n + 1`, we can say that for the loop to be able to execute again:

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers satisfying 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, additional_marks contains at least `n + 2` elements, with the next element being the one after `i + j`, and marks remains unchanged**
