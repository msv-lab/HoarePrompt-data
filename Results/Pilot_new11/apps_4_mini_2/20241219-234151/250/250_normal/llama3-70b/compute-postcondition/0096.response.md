Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and 2 <= `l` <= 10^9. `i` is less than `n`, `marks` contains at least `n` elements, and `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element where `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not already present in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now contains `i + j`.***
