According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. If `additional_marks` contains at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` contains at least 1 element with `j` being the first element there. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least 2 elements, and `j` should be the next element in the `additional_marks` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `i` is the next index after the current `i`, `marks` contains at least `n` elements, and `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements with `j` being the next element in `additional_marks`.**
