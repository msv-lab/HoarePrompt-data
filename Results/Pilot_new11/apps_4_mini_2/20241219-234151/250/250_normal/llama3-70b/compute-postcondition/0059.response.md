Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range [2, 100000]; `i` is 2; `need_x` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[2]` equals `x`, otherwise it is False; `need_y` is True if there exists at least one `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[2]` equals `y`, otherwise it is False; `marks` is the same as the initial set of integers from the input. If `n` is 2, the loop does not execute, and `need_x` and `need_y` will retain their initial boolean values. If `n` is greater than 2, then after the loop fully executes, `need_x` and `need_y` will reflect the existence of any valid differences in the `marks` array based on the conditions specified.**
