Given the initial state and the code loop provided, the output state can be derived by analyzing the final values and relationships of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

The loop iterates over each integer in `marks` and for each integer, it iterates through `additional_marks`. It checks if the sum of the current integer from `marks` and an integer from `additional_marks` does not exceed `l` and is not already present in `marks`. If both conditions are satisfied, the sum is appended to `additional_marks`.

After analyzing the behavior of the iterations and potential additions to `additional_marks`, it's reasonable to conclude:

1. The loop continues until there are no more valid sums to add to `additional_marks`.
2. The variables `marks`, `n`, `l`, `x`, `y` remain unchanged throughout the iterations.
3. The final `additional_marks` set will include the initial integers `x`, `y`, and any subsequent sums that meet the criteria.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `marks` is unchanged and contains at least `n` elements; `additional_marks` contains the original integers `x`, `y`, and all unique integers resulting from sums of the form `i + j` for `i` in `marks` and `j` in `additional_marks` that did not exceed `l` and not already present in `marks`.**
