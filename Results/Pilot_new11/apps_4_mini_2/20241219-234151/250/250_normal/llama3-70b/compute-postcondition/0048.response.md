Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range [2, 100000]; `i` is 2; `j` is 2; `need_x` is True; `need_y` is True or False; `marks` is the same as the initial set of integers from the input. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` is equal to `y`, then the condition is satisfied, indicating that the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `y`.***
