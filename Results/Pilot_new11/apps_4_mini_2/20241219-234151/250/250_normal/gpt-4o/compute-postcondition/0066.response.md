The `new_marks` set will have the element `mark - x` added to it. The value of `mark` is not given, but it is an element from the `marks` list, and the value of `x` is a positive integer that is less than `y` and less than or equal to `l`. Therefore, the new element being added to `new_marks` will be a positive integer since `mark` is greater than `x`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`; `new_marks` has the value `mark - x` added to it.**
