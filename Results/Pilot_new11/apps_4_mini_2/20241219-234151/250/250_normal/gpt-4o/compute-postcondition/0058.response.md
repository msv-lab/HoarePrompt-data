Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`. If `x_found` is False, and for the current `mark`, either `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is updated to include `mark + x`. Otherwise, if either `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is updated to include `mark - x`. If none of these conditions are satisfied, `new_marks` remains unchanged.***
