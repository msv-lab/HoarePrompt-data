The `marks` variable is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes an input line, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and collects them into a list. The `marks` variable will now contain a list of integers based on the input provided. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a list of integers obtained from `input`.**
