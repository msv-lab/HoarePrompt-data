The variable `marks_set` is assigned the value of a set created from the list `marks`. This operation converts `marks` into a set, which removes any duplicates and ensures that `marks_set` contains only unique elements. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all previously known preconditions, along with an update that `marks_set` now holds the unique values from `marks`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`.**
