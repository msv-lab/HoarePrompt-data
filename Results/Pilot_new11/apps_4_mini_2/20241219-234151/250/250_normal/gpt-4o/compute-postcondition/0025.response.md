Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`, and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; `mark` is the third element of `marks`; `y_found` remains True.**
