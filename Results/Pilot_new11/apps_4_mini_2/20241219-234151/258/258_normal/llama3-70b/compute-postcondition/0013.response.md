`ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `K` is an integer within the range of 1 to `N`, it means that `times[K - 1]` is a valid value from the `times` list. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, `ans` changes based on its previous value and the value of `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `y` is 1001, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat.**
