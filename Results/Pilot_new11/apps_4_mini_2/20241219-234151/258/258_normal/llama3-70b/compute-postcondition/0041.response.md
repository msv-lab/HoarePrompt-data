The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the value at position `K-1` in the `times` array. The variable `times` is sorted in ascending order, and `K` is within the valid range (1 to `N`), which means `times[K-1]` is an existing element in the sorted list. The value of `y` remains unchanged at 1000, as it cannot be incremented further. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `y` is 1000; `times` is sorted in ascending order; `ans` has been updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.**
