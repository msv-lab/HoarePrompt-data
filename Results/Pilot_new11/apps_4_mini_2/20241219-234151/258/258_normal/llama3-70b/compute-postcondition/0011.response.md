The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` assigns the result of `func_2` called with parameters `(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. The specific impact on the state depends on the value returned by `func_2`, but the details of that function aren't provided. Therefore, I will only indicate that `times` is updated.

Since `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, the new value of `ans` depends on the values of `times` and `ans` before this assignment, which aren't specified. The original definition of `times` as sorted remains valid, but its value has now been replaced.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updating of `times` while preserving all other original preconditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` has been updated from `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `y` is 1001, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat.**
