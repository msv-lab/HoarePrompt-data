The function accepts real numbers `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which are coordinates in a two-dimensional plane. It also uses a global list of tuples called `meats`, where each tuple consists of `x_i`, `y_i` coordinates and an integer `c_i` representing the hardness of each piece of meat. The function returns a list where each element is the product of the hardness `c_i` of each piece of meat and the output of a separate function `func_1(x, y, X, Y)`. This indicates that the function assumes `func_1` is defined elsewhere and returns a numerical value based on the provided coordinates. The sensitivity of the function to the global state of `meats`, as well as the reliance on `func_1`, means that edge cases related to missing or improperly defined `meats` or `func_1` may result in errors or unexpected results. Notably, the function does not handle empty lists of `meats`, nor does it check if `func_1` returns a valid, expected value for computation, which could lead to runtime exceptions in such scenarios.
