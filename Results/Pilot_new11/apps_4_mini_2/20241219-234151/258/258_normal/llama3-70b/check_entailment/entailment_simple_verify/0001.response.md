Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program fails to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input Variables:** The function `func_2` incorrectly uses the same `x` and `y` parameters for both the coordinates of the heat source and the coordinates of the meat. This leads to erroneous calculations because it does not evaluate the distances from the actual heat source location to the meats, thereby failing to determine the required time correctly.

2. **Heat Source Location Search:** The exhaustive grid search for the heat source location in `func_3` can be computationally expensive and may not yield the optimal placement for grilling the meats. It is unlikely that the program can guarantee the minimum grilling time given the large number of potential source placements without employing a more systematic optimization approach.

3. **Final Result Calculation:** The assumption in `func_3` that sorting `times` and taking the K-th smallest value leads to the correct grilling time is misleading. This does not account for the requirement that at least K pieces must be grilled within the minimum time, potentially yielding incorrect results.

Given these flaws in the logic and implementation, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description, justifying the conclusion that it is incorrect.
