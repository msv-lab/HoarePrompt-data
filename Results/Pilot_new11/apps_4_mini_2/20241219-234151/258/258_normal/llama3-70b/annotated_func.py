#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of a piece of meat, and X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates of the heat source.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the distance between the heat source at coordinates (X, Y) and the piece of meat at coordinates (x, y), calculated using the formula math.sqrt((X - x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer coordinates (x, y) representing the position of a piece of meat and two real number coordinates (X, Y) representing the position of a heat source. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the heat source and the piece of meat using the formula `math.sqrt((X - x)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing coordinates in a two-dimensional plane, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the i-th piece of meat and an integer c_i representing its hardness.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list containing the hardness c_i of each piece of meat multiplied by the result of func_1(x, y, X, Y) for each tuple in the 'meats' list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts real numbers `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which are coordinates in a two-dimensional plane. It also uses a global list of tuples called `meats`, where each tuple consists of `x_i`, `y_i` coordinates and an integer `c_i` representing the hardness of each piece of meat. The function returns a list where each element is the product of the hardness `c_i` of each piece of meat and the output of a separate function `func_1(x, y, X, Y)`. This indicates that the function assumes `func_1` is defined elsewhere and returns a numerical value based on the provided coordinates. The sensitivity of the function to the global state of `meats`, as well as the reliance on `func_1`, means that edge cases related to missing or improperly defined `meats` or `func_1` may result in errors or unexpected results. Notably, the function does not handle empty lists of `meats`, nor does it check if `func_1` returns a valid, expected value for computation, which could lead to runtime exceptions in such scenarios.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer in the range 1 to 60, K is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= K <= N, (x_i, y_i) are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, c_i is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, and all pairs (x_i, y_i) are unique.
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `ans` contains the minimum of the `times[K - 1]` values across all coordinates `(x, y)` from (-1000, -1000) to (1000, 1000), where `times` is the sorted output of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum of the `times[K - 1]` values across all coordinates `(x, y)` from (-1000, -1000) to (1000, 1000), where `ans` contains this minimum value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates all integer coordinates `(x, y)` within the range of -1000 to 1000, calls another function `func_2` for each coordinate pair with the same point as both the start and end points, sorts the resulting list of times, and identifies the minimum time value corresponding to the `K`-th position in this sorted list across all evaluated coordinates. The function ultimately returns this minimum value. It does not take any parameters and its return value encapsulates the minimum of the times collected from all evaluated coordinates, specifically focusing on the `K-th` index of the sorted outputs. Edge cases could include scenarios where `K` is at its bounds (1 or N), but these are handled by the logic of selecting the `K - 1` index in a sorted list. However, if `func_2` does not behave as expected or does not return a sorted list of sufficient length, this could lead to unexpected results, although those scenarios are not explicitly addressed within the provided code.
