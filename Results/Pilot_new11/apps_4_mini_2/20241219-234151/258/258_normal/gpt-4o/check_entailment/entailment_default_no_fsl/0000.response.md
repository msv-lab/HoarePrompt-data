Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function attempts to evaluate pairs of meats based on hardness and distance, but it lacks the necessary logic to ensure that the optimal heat source position minimizes the time effectively for the required number of meats (`K`). 

For example, suppose we have the following input:

```
3 2
0 0 1
2 0 1
1 1 100
```

The expected optimal time for grilling at least K pieces of meat (which is 2) is less than what the current implementation might produce due to the lack of thorough checks across all combinations of meat placements and their corresponding hardness values.

The output hints indicate that the function looks at pairs of meats, but it doesn't ensure that the calculated time for all valid combinations of positions is being considered comprehensively. The potential issue arises when the distribution of hardness and position (distance effects) may yield non-optimal results due to the way it processes pairs instead of examining the collective influence across all meats.

Thus, the code fails to guarantee correct time calculations for at least K pieces of meat in all scenarios, demonstrating that it does not fully satisfy the problem constraints.

Overall, due to this inadequacy in handling cases that require examining all means of placements and combinations, the code cannot be considered correct.
