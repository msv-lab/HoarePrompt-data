You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description regarding grilling pieces of meat, let’s analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(meats, K, T)`**:
    - The function iterates through all pairs of meat pieces. For each pair, it calculates a mid-point and attempts to find a point `(mx, my)` such that enough pieces can be cooked within time `T`.
    - The conditions and math implemented seem to implement a geometric approach to resolve the meat grilling problem by referencing how far the heat acts on the pieces of meat (using their hardness).

2. **Function `func_2(N, K, meats)`**:
    - This function attempts to find the minimal time required using binary search over the time `T`.
    - The loop continues until the potential difference between `low` and `high` is very small (`1e-07`), ensuring a high precision in the output.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
    - This function handles input parsing and directly ties the functions together to produce an output.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The code seems to rely heavily on the calculation involving `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, and relies on careful handling of distances and midpoints.
- A potential issue could arise if it misses cases where meat pieces are at extreme coordinates but possess high hardness. The precision in determining `(mx, my)` may not accurately reflect the optimal heat point for every potential configuration of meat pieces under varying `T`.
- The given boundaries of the problem and constraints are all respected, but without testing the specific input values and configurations, it’s difficult to assert that it functions correctly under all conditions specified.

### Test Input Example:
One example to consider is if:
```plaintext
N = 3, K = 2
-1000 0 1
0 1000 1
0 -1000 1
```
- Here, the pieces of meat are spread widely, and all have the same hardness. The function should ideally locate an efficient point for grilling.

### Conclusion:
- After examining the logic, while it aims to capture pivotal cases through calculations of `(mx, my)`, it could still falter on edge cases that involve extreme values or specifically arranged meat coordinates affecting how heat disperses due to corresponding hardness.

Thus, given the potential edge cases and the complexity of geometric placements versus hardness:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` reads input data to populate a list of meat pieces, where each piece is represented by its coordinates (x, y) and a hardness value (c). It expects the first two values from the input to indicate the number of pieces `N` and a selection limit `K`. After constructing the list of tuples `meats`, it calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `N`, `K`, and the `meats` list to obtain a result. This result, which is presumably a calculated value based on those inputs, is printed formatted to six decimal places. Note that the function assumes the input format does not contain any errors (i.e., it expects properly formatted integers) and does not handle edge cases such as invalid input or unexpected behavior if `N` or `K` do not conform to the specified constraints.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
