Postcondition: ***`count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `N` is greater than `i + 2`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1` is updated to equal `x2`, `y1` is updated to equal `y2`, and `c1` is updated to equal `c2`. The original values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are now replaced with the original values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` respectively. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
