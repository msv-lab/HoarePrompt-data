According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `N`. The loop starts from `j = i + 1` and continues as long as `j` is less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` has a value of `i + 1`, which means it is currently pointing to the next index after `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` would need to be incremented by one to `j = i + 2`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`. 

State: **`d`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are defined as described in the precondition, `count` is less than `K`, and `N` must be greater than `i + 2, j is i + 2`**.
