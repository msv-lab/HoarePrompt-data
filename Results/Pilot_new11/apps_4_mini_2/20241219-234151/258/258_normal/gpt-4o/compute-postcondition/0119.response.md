The variable `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned the values from `meats[j]` where `j` is equal to `i + 1`. This operation means that `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` now hold the corresponding values from the `meats` list at the index `j`, which is one position higher than `i`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. The restrictions state that `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, ensuring that `j` is within the bounds of the `meats` list.

Output State: **`count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` based on the distance condition, `j` is `i + 1`, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values from `meats[j]`.**
