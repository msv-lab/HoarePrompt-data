Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is equal to (dx * dx + dy * dy), `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`), and `i` is N where N is greater than `i + 1`. If the current value of `d` multiplied by `d2` is greater than `d2`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, there is no else part to modify the state of the program.***
