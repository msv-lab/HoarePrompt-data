The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `index` is 6. The previous states of `N`, `K`, `meats`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. The value of `data[6]` will be used to determine the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is now a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 6, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[4])**
