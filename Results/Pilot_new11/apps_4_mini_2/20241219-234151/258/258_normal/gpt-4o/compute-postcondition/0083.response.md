Output State: **`d` is equal to the previous value of `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `cx` is the average of the last two x-coordinates `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is the average of the last two y-coordinates `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` and `dy` are half the differences of their respective coordinates from the last two tuples, `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` within threshold distance `T` from (`mx`, `my`), `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, and the loop continues if `d` is negative.**
