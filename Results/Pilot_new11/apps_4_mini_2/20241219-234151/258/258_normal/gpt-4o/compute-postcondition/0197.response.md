The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and we maintain their initial conditions. The exact values of `x1` and `x2` are not specified, but `dx` will be equal to half the difference between `x1` and `x2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.

Output State: **`count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`**.
