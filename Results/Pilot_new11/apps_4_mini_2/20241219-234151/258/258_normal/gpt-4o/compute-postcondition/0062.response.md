The statement `continue` is used within a loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, when `continue` is executed, the loop control is returned to the start of the loop, and no variables are altered as a direct result of this statement. Given that the only effect is the continuation of the loop, the state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a negative value resulting from (c1 - c2) * T, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is equal to ( (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 ) / 4 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
