Functionality: **The function `func_3` reads input data to populate a list of meat pieces, where each piece is represented by its coordinates (x, y) and a hardness value (c). It expects the first two values from the input to indicate the number of pieces `N` and a selection limit `K`. After constructing the list of tuples `meats`, it calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `N`, `K`, and the `meats` list to obtain a result. This result, which is presumably a calculated value based on those inputs, is printed formatted to six decimal places. Note that the function assumes the input format does not contain any errors (i.e., it expects properly formatted integers) and does not handle edge cases such as invalid input or unexpected behavior if `N` or `K` do not conform to the specified constraints.**
