The code snippet swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. In the initial state, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned from `meats[i]` and the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned from `meats[j]`. After executing the code, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` will now hold the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` will hold the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`. 

Thus, the output state must reflect these changes.

Output State: **`d`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are defined as described in the precondition; `count` is less than `K`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`.**
