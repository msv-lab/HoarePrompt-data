The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The initial state indicates that `dy` represents half the differences of the respective coordinates from the last two tuples processed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is equal to (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples processed, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`), `i` is N where N is greater than `i + 1`.**
