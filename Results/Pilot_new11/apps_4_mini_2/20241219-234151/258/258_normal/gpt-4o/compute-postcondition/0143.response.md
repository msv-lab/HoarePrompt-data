Postcondition: ***`d` is the calculated difference based on the conditions of the meats, `cx` is the average x-coordinate from the last two tuples processed, `cy` is the average y-coordinate from the last two tuples processed, `dx` and `dy` represent half the differences of the respective coordinates from the last two tuples processed, `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples processed, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within the threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`), `i` is N where N is greater than `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are taken from `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are taken from `meats[j]`, and the current value of `c1 * T is less than c2 * T`.***
