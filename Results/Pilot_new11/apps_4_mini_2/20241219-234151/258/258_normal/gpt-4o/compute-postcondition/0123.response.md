The statement `continue` will cause the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since we are not given any specific variables that would change as a direct result of this command, we will state any implications of this based on the precondition.

The values of `count`, `j`, `N`, and `d` remain unchanged. However, we note that the current iteration for the loop that contains the `continue` statement is exited and the next iteration begins.

Output State: **`count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` based on the distance condition, `j` is `i + 1`, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, and `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, which is negative if `c1 < c2; the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
