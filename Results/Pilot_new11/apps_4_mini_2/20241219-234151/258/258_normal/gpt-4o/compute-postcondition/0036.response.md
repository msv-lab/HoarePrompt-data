Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` retain their previous states; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * (c1 * T - c2 * T) - (c1 * T - c2 * T) * (c1 * T - c2 * T)) / d2; `count` is assigned the sum of valid conditions from meats and `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` must be greater than `i + 2; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.**
