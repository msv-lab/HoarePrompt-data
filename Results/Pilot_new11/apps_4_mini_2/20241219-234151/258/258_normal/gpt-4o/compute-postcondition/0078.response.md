Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, where `c1` is less than `c2`, making `d` a negative value; `cx` and `cy` are the average of the coordinates from the last two tuples in `meats`; `dx` and `dy` are half the differences of the respective coordinates from the last two tuples; `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples; `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within the threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`); `i` is less than `N - 1`; `j` is `i + 1`. The value of `d` is less than 0.***
