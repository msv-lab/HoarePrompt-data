Postcondition: ***`d`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are defined as described in the precondition; `count` is less than `K`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`.***
