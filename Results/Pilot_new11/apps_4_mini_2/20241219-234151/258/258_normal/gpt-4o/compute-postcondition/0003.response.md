The code snippet initializes the variable `meats` as an empty list. The values of `N`, `K`, and `data` are unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `meats` is now an empty list while retaining all previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is the input integer from `data[0]`, `K` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` is an empty list, and `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
