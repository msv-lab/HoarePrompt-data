The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Given that `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, the calculation can be explicitly written as:

```
d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)
```
This results in:

```
d2 = ( (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 ) + ( (y1 - y2)^2 / 4 )
```

Therefore, `d2` is the sum of half the squares of the differences of `x1` and `x2`, and `y1` and `y2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`d` is a negative value resulting from (c1 - c2) * T, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is equal to ( (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 ) / 4.**
