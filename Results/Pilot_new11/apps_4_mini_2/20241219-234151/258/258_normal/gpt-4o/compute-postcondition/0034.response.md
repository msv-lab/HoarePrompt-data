Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`; `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` retain their previous states; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; count is assigned the sum of valid conditions from meats and count is less than K; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` must be greater than `i + 2. If `d` is less than 0, the loop continues, and if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to `x1`, `y2` is equal to `y1`, and `c2` is equal to `c1. Otherwise, the original state is preserved.***
