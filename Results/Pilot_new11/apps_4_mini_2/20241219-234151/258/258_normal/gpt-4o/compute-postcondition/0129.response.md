The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The previous state does not mention specific values for `y1` and `y2`, so we can only express `dy` in terms of those variables. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` based on the distance condition; `j` is `i + 1`; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
