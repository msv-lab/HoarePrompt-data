The value of `index` is incremented by 3. Since the previous value of `index` is 2, the new value of `index` becomes 5. Other variables, including `N`, `K`, and `meats`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is now a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 5, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.**
