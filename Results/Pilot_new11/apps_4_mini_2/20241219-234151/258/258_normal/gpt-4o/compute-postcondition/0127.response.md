The value of `cy` is assigned the average of `y1` and `y2`, so `cy` becomes `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. There are no specific values provided for `y1` or `y2`, so `cy` is expressed as an average. 

Output State: **`count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` based on the distance condition; `j` is `i + 1`; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
