You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its functionality.

The problem requires splitting an array into multiple subarrays where the sum of the elements in each subarray is not zero. If it is not possible to achieve this, the program should print "NO". 

### Analysis of the Program:

1. The program calculates the prefix sums of the input array.
2. It first checks if the total sum of the array is zero. If it is zero, it prints "NO", which correctly identifies that splitting the array into non-zero sum segments is impossible.
3. If the total sum is not zero, it prints "YES" and proceeds to identify potential subarrays:
   - It keeps track of the current starting index of a valid segment (`l`).
   - It iterates through the prefix sums from index 1 to `n`.
   - If a prefix sum is non-zero and not equal to the total prefix sum (this condition seems intended to avoid immediately creating a segment that would lead back to another zero sum), it prints the segment.

### Potential Cases Not Handled:

- The critical point is how the segments are formed. The check for `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` might lead to incorrectly formed segments.
- For example, consider the case with an array that has a zero prefix sum at some index `i`, but another non-zero element follows, which could cause the segments to inadvertently lead to a zero sum when considered in sequence.
  
### Test Case for Failure:

Consider the input:
```
5
2 -2 3 -3 0
```
- The total sum is `0`, so the program would print "NO". This is correct for this case.
  
But consider this example:
```
4
1 -1 2 -1
```
- The program would consider the total sum as `1` (not zero), hence it will print `YES`.
- However, it may form segments incorrectly due to the sum checks leading to a single segment like `1 4` instead of correctly identifying that subarrays such as `1 1`, `2 2` could be preferable without leading to invalid splits.

### Conclusion:

In the given implementation, while it correctly identifies some cases leading to a "NO", it cannot handle certain configurations of numbers that may still allow for segments that ultimately don’t meet the zero-sum condition. 

Therefore, there are edge cases where the splitting logic could fail.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers, computes the prefix sums for the list, and checks if the sum of the entire list is zero. If the total sum is zero, it prints 'NO'. If not, it prints 'YES' and counts the number of indices where the prefix sums are neither zero nor equal to the total sum. It prints these valid indices along with the last evaluated index. The final output includes the count of such valid indices and the last evaluated index `n`. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input might not meet the constraints (e.g., invalid integers or incorrect list length).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
