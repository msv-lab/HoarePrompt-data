The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This does not change any variables or their values in the initial state. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `prefix_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code does not return any value, only prints a message.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is 0; printed 'NO'.**
