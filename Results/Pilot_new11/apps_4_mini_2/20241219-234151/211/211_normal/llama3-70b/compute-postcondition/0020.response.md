The value of `l` is assigned the value of `r`, which is currently 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `l` will also have the value of 1. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `i` is `n - 1`, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, `'YES'` has been printed, `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, `l` is now 1.**
