According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 during the first iteration. The `prefix_sum` list will be accessed using the index `i`, which will range from 0 to n-1 during the loop iterations. 

As `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, accessing `prefix_sum[i]` will be valid for all iterations as `i` will range from 0 to 99 (for n = 100). 

Thus, there are no additional adjustments required for the loop to execute, except for verifying that `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 0**
