Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `i` is `n - 1`, and the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0.***
