The variable `l` is assigned the value `1`. Since this value is not affecting any other variables, and there are no changes to `n`, `a`, `prefix_sum`, `i`, or `k`, the output state remains primarily the same except for the updated value of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `i` is `n - 1`, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1, `l` is 1.**
