According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n`. The loop can continue executing as long as `r` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `r` must be increased by 1, making it 2. There are no changes to `k` and `l`, as `k` remains 2 and `l` remains 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, and `prefix_sum[k]` represents the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. The sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, and 'YES' has been printed, k is 2, l is 1, r is 2**
