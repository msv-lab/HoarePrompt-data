The value of `k` is assigned 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, including `n`, `a`, `prefix_sum`, and `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[k]` is equal to the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `i` is `n - 1`, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, and `k` is 1.**
