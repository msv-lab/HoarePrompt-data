The variable `a` is assigned a list created by mapping the `input().split()` values to integers. The variable `n` remains the same, being the number of integers in the list provided through input. The value of `n` is positive and determines the length of the list `A`. 

Since `n` is assigned a new value via `int(input())`, we don't know its new exact value, but it is still bounded (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The only affected variable after this line of code is `a`, which will now be a list of `n` integers provided at input.

Therefore, the Output State will indicate that `a` is a list of integers based on input, while `n` still qualifies as a positive integer adhering to its previous constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `a` is a list of `n` integers based on input.**
