The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `A`. `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, inclusive. `A` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is within the range of -1000 to 1000, inclusive. The function does not return any specific output value based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `A` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.**
