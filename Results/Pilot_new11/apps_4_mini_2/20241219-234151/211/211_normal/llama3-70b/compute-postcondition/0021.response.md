Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, and `prefix_sum[k]` represents the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` for `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. The sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, and 'YES' has been printed. If `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, then `k` is updated to 2 and `l` remains 1, while `r` is still 1. If the conditions do not hold true, no changes to `k`, `l`, and `r` occur.***
