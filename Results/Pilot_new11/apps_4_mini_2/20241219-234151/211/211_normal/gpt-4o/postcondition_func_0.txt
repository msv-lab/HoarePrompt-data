The function reads a positive integer `n`, which specifies the length of a list `A` containing `n` integers, with each integer in the range of -1000 to 1000. It calculates the sum of the integers in list `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints "YES", followed by "1", and the values "1" and `n`, indicating that a non-zero sum was found. If the sum is zero, it checks for non-zero elements in `A`. If it finds one, it prints "YES", followed by "2", and the indices of the first non-zero element (1-based index) and a range from the next index to `n`. If all elements are zero, the function does not provide any output. The overall state of the program after execution is that it will either confirm the presence of non-zero sums or indicate that all elements are zero without a specific output.
