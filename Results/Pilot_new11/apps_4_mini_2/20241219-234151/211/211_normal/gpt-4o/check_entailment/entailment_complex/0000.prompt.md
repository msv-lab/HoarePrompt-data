You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if (total_sum != 0) :
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: if all elements in `A` are 0, then `A` is all zeros; otherwise, `A` contains at least one non-zero element, `n` is greater than 0, and `total_sum` is 0.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `n` is the length of `A`, and `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES', '1', and the values of '1' and `n` have been printed. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, then all elements in `A` are 0; otherwise, `A` contains at least one non-zero element, `n` is greater than 0, and `total_sum` equals 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n`, which specifies the length of a list `A` containing `n` integers, with each integer in the range of -1000 to 1000. It calculates the sum of the integers in list `A`. If the sum is not zero, it prints "YES", followed by "1", and the values "1" and `n`, indicating that a non-zero sum was found. If the sum is zero, it checks for non-zero elements in `A`. If it finds one, it prints "YES", followed by "2", and the indices of the first non-zero element (1-based index) and a range from the next index to `n`. If all elements are zero, the function does not provide any output. The overall state of the program after execution is that it will either confirm the presence of non-zero sums or indicate that all elements are zero without a specific output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
