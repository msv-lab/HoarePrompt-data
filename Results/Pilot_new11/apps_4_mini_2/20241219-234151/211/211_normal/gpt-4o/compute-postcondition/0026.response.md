The code prints the string '1' followed by the result of the expression `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initialized to `2`, the expression evaluates to `3`. The print function does not alter any variable states. Therefore, the output state remains mostly unchanged, but we include the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 2, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, and '1 3' is printed.**
