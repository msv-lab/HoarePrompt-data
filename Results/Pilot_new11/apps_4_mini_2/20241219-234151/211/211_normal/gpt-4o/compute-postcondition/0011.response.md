The `print` function outputs the string '2'. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same, with 'YES' having previously been printed.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, 'YES' has been printed, and '2' has been printed.**
