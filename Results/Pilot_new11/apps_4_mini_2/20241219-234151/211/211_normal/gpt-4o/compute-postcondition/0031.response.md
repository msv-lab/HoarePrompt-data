Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of integers satisfying -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `n` is the length of `A`, and `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES', '1', and the values of '1' and `n` have been printed. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, then all elements in `A` are 0; otherwise, `A` contains at least one non-zero element, `n` is greater than 0, and `total_sum` equals 0.***
