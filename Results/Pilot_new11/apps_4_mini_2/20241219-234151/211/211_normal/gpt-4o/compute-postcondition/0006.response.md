The code snippet prints the string '1' followed by the value of `n`. Since `n` is equal to the length of the list `A`, this will display that value. The previous values of the variables `A`, `n`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that '1' was printed along with the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `n` is equal to the length of the list `A`; `total_sum` is equal to `sum(A)`; the current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0; 'YES' has been printed; '1' has been printed; '1' and `n` have been printed.**
