The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, '1' and '1' have been printed, and `2` and `n` are printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
