The code `print('1', i + 1)` will print the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. 

Given the Initial State:
- `A` is a list of integers,
- `n` is greater than 0,
- `total_sum` is 0,
- `i` is 0,
- 'YES' has been printed,
- '2' has been printed.

Now, since `i` is 0, `i + 1` will result in 1. The print statement does not change the values of `A`, `n`, `total_sum`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output state will contain all unchanged variables and state. 

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and '1' and '1' have been printed.**
