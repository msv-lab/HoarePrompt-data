The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string '1' followed by the result of the expression `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is `1`, therefore `i + 1` computes to `2`. The output does not change any variables in the state, just prints the result. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers, `n` must be greater than 1, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, and '2' has been printed. Output of print statement is '1 2'.**
