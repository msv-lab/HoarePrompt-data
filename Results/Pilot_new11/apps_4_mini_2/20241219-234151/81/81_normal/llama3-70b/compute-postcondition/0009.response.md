Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which must be greater than or equal to 1. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function employs the Euclidean algorithm, where it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` reaches 0. At the conclusion of the function, `a` holds the GCD, and `b` is guaranteed to be 0. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are less than 1, which could lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, since the function does not check for inputs of `0`, it assumes the inputs will always meet the precondition of being at least 1.**
