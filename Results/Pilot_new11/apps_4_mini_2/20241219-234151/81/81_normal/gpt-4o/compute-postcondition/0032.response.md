Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `count`, `z`, `i`, and `b` are integers. If `z % i == 0`, then if `l <= a <= r`, `l <= b <= r`, `math.gcd(a, b) == x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, if `a` equals `b`, `count` is increased by 1, `z` remains equal to `y // x`, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, and `b` is equal to `(y // x) // (k + 2) * x`. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 2, `z` still equals `y // x`, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, and `b` continues to be `(y // x) // (k + 2) * x`, with all conditions for `i` being less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(z))`.***
