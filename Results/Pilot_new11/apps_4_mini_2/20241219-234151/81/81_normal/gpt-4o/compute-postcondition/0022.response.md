Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `count` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` is updated to `count + 2`. In both cases, `z` is equal to `y // x`; `i` is equal to `k + 1` where 1 ≤ `k + 1` ≤ int(math.sqrt(z)); `a` is equal to `i * x`; `b` is equal to `(y // x) // i * x.***
