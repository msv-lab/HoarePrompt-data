Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `r` is an integer such that `r` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9, `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9, `z` is equal to `y // x`, and `count` is 0. The current value of `z` is such that `z % i == 0`.***
