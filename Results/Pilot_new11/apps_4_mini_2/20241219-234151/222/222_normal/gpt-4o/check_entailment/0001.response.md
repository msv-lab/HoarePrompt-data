To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the associated logic.

**Problem Requirements**:
1. Miroslav has `n` skewers laid out in a row.
2. Turning skewer `i` affects `k` skewers on each side of `i`, meaning it affects skewers from `i-k` to `i+k`.
3. The goal is to determine the minimal number of skewer turns required to turn all skewers over.

The provided code functions as follows:
1. It accepts input values for `n` and `k`.
2. In the function `func_1`, it initializes an empty list called `positions` to store the skewer indices that will be turned over.
3. Using a while loop, it adds skewer indices to `positions`, incrementing `i` by `2*k + 1` each iteration until it goes beyond `n`.
4. It finally prints the total number of operations and the chosen positions.

Now, let's evaluate the effectiveness of the solution for various cases.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Example where `k = 0`**: This means turning one skewer will affect only that skewer. In this case, Miroslav has to turn each skewer individually. If `n = 6`, the function would return 6 operations which is correct since he must turn each skewer individually.
2. **Example where `k >= n/2`**: In this case, one turn is sufficient because turning a skewer in the middle will affect all skewers. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, turning skewer `4` will suffice.
3. **General cases with varying values of `k`**: For various values of `n` and `k`, we must ensure that the returned positions cover all skewers exactly once without leaving any in their initial state.

### Test Cases:
- **Case 1**: Input `(7, 2)` should yield positions `1` and `6`.
  
- **Case 2**: Input `(5, 1)` should yield positions `1` and `4`.

Now letâ€™s analyze whether the implemented function correctly handles all potential scenarios based on the problem description.

### Critical Analysis:
The function appends skewer numbers iterating by `2*k + 1`, which might not cover all skewers in scenarios when `k` is not large enough relative to `n`. For example, consider the scenario `n = 5` and `k = 1`. The function will append `1` (affecting skewers `1`, `2`, `3`), then it will append `3` (affecting `2`, `3`, `4`), and finally append `5` (affecting `4`, `5`). This misses the skewer `2` being turned down back to initial due to overlapping affects. 

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the program could miss certain skewers depending on the range of `k` and `n`, meaning it would not fulfill requirements in all cases.

Thus, the answer is:
Correctness: **False** 

The provided code does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over in the minimum number of operations for all possible configurations of `n` and `k`.
