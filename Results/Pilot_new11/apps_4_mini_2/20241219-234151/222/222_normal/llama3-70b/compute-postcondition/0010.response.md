The variable `l` is printed, which means that its value is displayed as output. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged: `n` is an input positive integer, and `k` is an input non-negative integer. The state of `res` is determined by the values of `n` and `k`, but it is not directly affected by the print statement. The output will include `l` based on its previously calculated value.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is the calculated value (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is the list of values from the formula `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `l - 1` (if l > 0) or an empty list (if l = 0), and `l` is printed.**
