The `print` statement generates output by presenting the list `res` as a space-separated string. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The variable `l` is still defined as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, and `res` is either a list filled with values as long as `l` is greater than 0 or an empty list if `l` is 0. 

Since `print` does not alter the value of `res`, the only impact of this code is to output the current state of `res` as a string.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is the calculated value (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is the list of values from the formula i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 for i from 0 to l - 1 (if l > 0), or an empty list (if l = 0), and the printed output is the space-separated string representation of `res`.**
