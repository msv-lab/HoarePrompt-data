#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and k is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is a list containing the values from the formula `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `l - 1`. If `l` is 0, then `res` remains an empty list.
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 1000) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1000), from input. It calculates `l`, which represents how many times `k * 2 + 1` fits into `n` when considering `k`. Then, it creates a list `res` that contains `l` elements, where each element is computed as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l - 1`. Finally, it prints the value of `l` and the values in `res` as a space-separated string. If `l` is 0, `res` will be an empty list, leading to an empty output for the second print statement. There are no explicit return values, and potential edge cases such as `k` being 0 or `n` being at its upper limit are addressed through the calculations.
