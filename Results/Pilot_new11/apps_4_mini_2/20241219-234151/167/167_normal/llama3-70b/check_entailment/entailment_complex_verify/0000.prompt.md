You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
8
1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

Output
YES
3 3

Input
6
1 2 1 2 5 3

Output
NO

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we can analyze the logic of the program and check for edge cases.

### Problem Overview:
The problem requires us to determine if there are positive integers `x` and `y` such that a matrix of size `x × y`, filled with integers 1 through `x*y`, can accommodate a given sequence of visited cells in the manner described. The program takes an integer `n`, representing how many cells are visited, followed by a sequence of integers representing those cells.

### Program Logic:
1. The program iterates through possible values of `x` from 1 to 1,000,000 and attempts to find a compatible value for `y`.
2. For each value of `x`, it checks if the product `x * y` is greater than the maximum cell number in the path.
3. It verifies if all visited cells are within the bounds of `1` to `x*y`.
4. A helper function `func_1(x, y)` checks if the sequence of visited cells corresponds to valid adjacency in the matrix.

### Analysis for Potential Issues:
1. **Limits on `x` and `y`:** The nested loops for `x` and `y` only iterate up to 1,000,000. However, since `x` and `y` must be such that `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`, the program may find a solution for `x` and `y` less than `1,000,000`, but fail to find higher values where a valid structure could exist. For example, the path could require larger dimensions.

2. **Adjacency check:** The function `func_1(x, y)` computes the 0-based matrix coordinates and checks if the current position is adjacent to the previous one. This works only if the matrix is constructed correctly, but it is important to ensure it is checking against the correct bounds.

3. **Special cases:** The program does not consider cases where visited cells may duplicate or transition in a way that seems valid but is not possible in a matrix bounds defined by smaller dimensions.

### Test Case:
Let’s consider a case where the program may encounter a problem:

**Input:**
```
6
1 7 3 4 8 5
```
Here, with the given values, the maximum cell is `8`. The path suggests transitions that cannot possibly happen in a matrix with lower bounds (like 1,3) if you’re limited to size based on the initial grid checks.

- If `x = 1`, then `y` must be at least `8`, which leads to dimensions out of our valid range where some moves are impossible to fulfill.
- If `x = 2` and `y = 4`, the moves from `7` to `3` or `4` stint within row-navigation requiring jumps not allowed by that dimension setting.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logic and provided problem description, the program does not sufficiently verify all the possible combinations for `x` and `y`, potentially leading to false positives or denying valid scenarios. It can't catch certain adjacency failures for larger or specific path layouts while limited to the maximum iteration through `1,000,000`.

Therefore:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and a is a list of n integers such that each integer a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `px` is equal to `nx` after processing the last element in `a`, `py` is equal to `ny` after processing the last element in `a`, `v` is the last element of `a`, `nx` is `(a[n-1] - 1) // y`, `ny` is `(a[n-1] - 1) % y`, and for every pair of consecutive elements in `a`, the condition `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) == 1` has held true.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the condition abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) == 1 holds true for the last processed pair of consecutive elements in list 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, and processes a list `a` of `n` integers (with constraints on its size and integer values). It iterates through this list and calculates two derived values, `nx` and `ny`, for each element based on the formulae `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y` respectively. The function checks whether the Manhattan distance between the current and previous derived positions (`nx`, `ny` and `px`, `py`) equals 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a`. If this condition fails at any point during the iteration, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it ultimately returns `True`, confirming that the conditions held true throughout the processing of the list. 

The function does not utilize the parameters `x` nor does it handle edge cases where the list may be empty, or where values in `a` may not meet the specified constraints, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, the final state indicates success or failure based solely on the traversal of list `a` and the derived conditions without taking `x` or potential invalid inputs into consideration.
