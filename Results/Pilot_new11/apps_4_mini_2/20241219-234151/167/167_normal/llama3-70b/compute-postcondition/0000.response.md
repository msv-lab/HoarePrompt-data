The code initializes the variables `px` and `py` to 0. The previous state of the variables `n` and `a` is unaffected by this assignment because the assignment does not involve these variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers such that each integer a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `px` is 0; `py` is 0.**
