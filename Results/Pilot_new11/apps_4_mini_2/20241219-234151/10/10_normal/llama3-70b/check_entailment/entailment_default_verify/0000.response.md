Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1` only considers the first cell of a sofa's coordinates when counting the sofas relative to Grandpa Maks's sofa. This oversight can lead to incorrect results, particularly in cases where the two cells that make up a sofa are crucial for determining their relative positions (left, right, top, and bottom). Thus, the faulty logic in counting based solely on one cell renders the program unable to accurately solve the problem as described.

The output hints support this assessment by indicating that the function does not account for various placements correctly and that there can be scenarios where the function fails to count the sofas correctly. Therefore, the original conclusion that the program may not function correctly for various input configurations remains valid.
