The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem of identifying Grandpa Maks's sofa based on the conditions given in the problem description. 

Let's break down the problem requirements and compare them with what the program does:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of sofas (`d`), the dimensions of the storehouse (`n` and `m`), and the coordinates of each sofa as well as the conditions (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`) that represent how many sofas are adjacent to a specified sofa in various directions.

2. **Data Structure**: 
   - It stores sofas as tuples of coordinates representing two adjacent cells in a list `sofas`, which is appropriate for the problem's needs.

3. **Counting Adjacent Sofas**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of sofas that satisfy the left, right, top, and bottom conditions with respect to the provided sofa.
   - The comparisons check whether the first coordinate of the queried sofa and the other sofas match up with the conditions based on their coordinates, which is consistent with the criteria described in the problem statement.

4. **Matching Conditions**:
   - The program iterates through all the sofas using their index. For each sofa, it calls `func_1` to get the counts of other sofas in relation to it. It then checks if the counts match the provided conditions.
   - If a match is found, it correctly prints the 1-based index of that sofa. If no matches are found after checking all sofas, it prints `-1`.

5. **Logic and Performance**:
   - The logic used for counting other sofas meets the requirements as per the problem description. The program is designed to handle the maximum constraints as stated (up to 100,000 sofas), and the nested loop, though O(d^2), is expected to function within the given limits due to the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description, taking all necessary inputs, processing the counts accurately, and providing the expected output.

Correctness: **True** 

The program performs the steps needed to satisfy the problem requirements for all given cases, thus it remains correct consistently according to the description provided.
