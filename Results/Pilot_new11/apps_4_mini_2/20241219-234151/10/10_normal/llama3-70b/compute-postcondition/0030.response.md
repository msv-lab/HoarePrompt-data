Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of at least 3 tuples, and `s` is the third tuple in `sofas`. If `sofa[0][0]` is greater than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` is equal to `s[0][1]`, `right` is increased by 1 while `left` remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, both `right` and `left` remain unchanged.***
