The variables `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are all being assigned the value of `0` in the given code. Since these variables were not previously defined in the initial state, their values are now explicitly initialized to `0`. The states of the other variables such as `sofa`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`sofa` is an integer representing the index of a sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of the sofas, and the last input line contains four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) representing the number of sofas around the specified sofa; `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` are all 0.**
