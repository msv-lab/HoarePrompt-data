Postcondition: ***`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, and `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`. If `sofa[0][0]` is greater than `s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]` is equal to `s[0][1]`, then `right` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `right` remains unchanged.***
