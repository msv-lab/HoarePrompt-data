According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sofas` list. The loop will iterate through `sofas`, and since it contains at least one tuple, it can execute again for the second tuple (if present). At the end of the last iteration, `s` is the first tuple in `sofas`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to update `s` to be the next tuple in the list. So if `s` is currently the first tuple, we can denote the next tuple as `s` being changed to the second tuple in `sofas`. The index representing the valid sofa is incremented by 1 to point to the next tuple of interest, assuming the loop hasn't finished iterating through the list yet.

Thus, if `sofa` remains unchanged and the other states are also unchanged (as no modifications to `left`, `right`, or `bottom` occur when `s` is equal to `sofa`), we should maintain the values of `left`, `right`, and `bottom` too.

State: **`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples that contains at least one tuple, `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`**
