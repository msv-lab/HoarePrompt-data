The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples that contains at least one tuple, `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`, and `left` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofa` is an index representing a valid sofa, `sofas` is a list of tuples that contains at least one tuple, `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`, `left` is increased by 1**.
