The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, there is no effect on the values of the variables since we are not changing any variable states.

The values of `d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain the same as in the initial state, but we are skipping further actions in the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
