Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is unchanged. If `i` equals 2, then `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged. If `i` does not equal 2 and the condition `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j` is satisfied, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `i` does not equal 2 but the condition is not satisfied, then `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the respective values from `sofas[2]`.***
