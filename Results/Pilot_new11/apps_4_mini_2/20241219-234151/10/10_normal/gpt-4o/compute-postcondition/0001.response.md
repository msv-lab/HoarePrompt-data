The variable `n` is assigned the first value from the input, and `m` is assigned the second value from the input. Both `n` and `m` must remain positive integers and are constrained (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5). The other variables (`d`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, and `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1)**.
