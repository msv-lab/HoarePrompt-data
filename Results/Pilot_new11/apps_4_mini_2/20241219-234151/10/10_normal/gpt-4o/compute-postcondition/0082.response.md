The command `continue` does not change any values of the variables; it will simply skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The initial state variables remain unchanged. After executing the code, the status is as follows:

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
