The variable `left_count[i]` is increased by 1. The initial conditions don't state the exact value of `left_count[i]`, but it indicates that it was previously some value. The other variables `d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment to `left_count[i]`.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`, and `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
