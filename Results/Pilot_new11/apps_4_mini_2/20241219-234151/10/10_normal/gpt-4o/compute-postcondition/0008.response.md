The `sofas` list is updated by appending a tuple containing the values `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. Since these values are taken from user input, we cannot determine their specific values, but we know that `sofas` will now contain at least one additional element in the form of a tuple.

The other variables, including `d`, `n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, and the previous state of `sofas` (which previously had only one element), remain unaffected except for `sofas`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1), `sofas` contains at least two elements, including the newly appended `((x1, y1, x2, y2))`.

Output State: **`d` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), `n` is defined by input, `m` is defined by input, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1), `sofas` has at least two elements, one being `((x1, y1, x2, y2))`.**
