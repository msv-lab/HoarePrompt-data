Postcondition: ***If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, `i` is incremented by 1, `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if `y1 < y1_j`, `y2 < y1_j`, `x1 < x1_j`, and `x2 < x1_j`; `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`; `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1; `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1; while `j`, `d`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged and are assigned from `sofas[1]`. If the condition is not met, the program state remains unchanged regarding count increments and assignments.***
