Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` are unchanged, `x1_j` and `y1_j` are the first two values of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` and `y2_j` are the next two values of `sofas[j]`, and if both `x1` and `x2` are less than `x1_j`, `i` is not equal to `j`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
