To properly simulate the execution of the provided Python code given the initial state, we start from the detail that `i` is equal to `j`, which is initially `0`. Therefore, the condition of the if statement is satisfied and the code will execute the unpacking of the tuple `sofas[j]`.

1. The variable `j` is `0`, and so `sofas[j]` corresponds to `sofas[0]`.
2. The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned based on the values from `sofas[0]`.

Assuming `sofas[0]` is a predefined tuple containing exactly four values (for example, `(value1, value2, value3, value4)`), the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will be assigned those respective values.

Since we do not have actual values of `sofas`, we will represent these variables generically.

Thus, the output state acknowledges the changes in the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` based on the first element of the `sofas` tuple.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`.**
