According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `i` is less than `d`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `d` is a positive integer which is at least 2 to allow for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 2**
