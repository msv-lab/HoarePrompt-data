The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the calculation results in `target_sofa` being 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 2, and `target_sofa` is 3.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples (positions of sofas), `i` is 2, `target_sofa` is 3**
