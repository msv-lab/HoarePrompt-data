According to the code, the continuation of the loop depends on the variable `j` and `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to its current value (which is not specified here), and `d` remains unchanged. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `d` must be greater than `j`, and `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if the current value of `j` is `current_j`, then for the loop to execute again, the condition must hold that `d` is greater than `current_j`, and at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be `current_j + 1`.

State: **`j` is `current_j + 1`, `d` must be greater than `current_j + 1`**
