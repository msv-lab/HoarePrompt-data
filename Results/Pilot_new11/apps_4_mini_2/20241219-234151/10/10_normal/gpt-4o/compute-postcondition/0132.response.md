Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1, and `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1 if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `j`, `d`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged and are assigned from `sofas[1]`.***
