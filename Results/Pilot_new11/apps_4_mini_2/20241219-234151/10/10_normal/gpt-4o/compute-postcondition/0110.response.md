The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one. While the values of the variables themselves do not change, with `continue`, the current values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain intact, and the loop control will move to the next iteration. It implies that we are effectively ignoring the current iteration where this code was executed. 

Given the conditions that `d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` have been assigned values from `sofas[i]`, `d` is greater than `i + 1`, and the length of `sofas` is greater than `i`, `i` is equal to `j`.

The states of the variables do not change, except for the control flow moving to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[i]`, and the loop continues without changes to the variable values.**
