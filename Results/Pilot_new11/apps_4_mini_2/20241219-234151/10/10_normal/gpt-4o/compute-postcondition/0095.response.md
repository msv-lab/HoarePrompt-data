Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 2, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the respective values from `sofas[2]` if it exists. If `i` is equal to `j`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, there is no else part to consider.***
