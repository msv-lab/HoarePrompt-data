Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]` are unchanged, `x1_j` and `y1_j` are the first two values of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` and `y2_j` are the next two values of `sofas[j]`, and if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j` while `i` is not equal to `j`, then `left_count[i]` is also increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
