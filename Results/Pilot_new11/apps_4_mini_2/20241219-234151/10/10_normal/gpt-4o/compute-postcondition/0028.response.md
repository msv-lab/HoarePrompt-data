Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer. If `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `i` is set to 1, `j` remains 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, and `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, and the current value of `x2` is greater than `x2_j`.***
