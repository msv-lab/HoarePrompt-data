The code assigns values to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` based on the elements in the `sofas` list at the index `j`, which has a fixed value of 1. The initial state indicates that `j` is 1, which means we are accessing `sofas[1]`. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and there's no operation that modifies its value.

Since the code accesses the `sofas` list and assigns its values to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, the precondition of `d`, `i`, and `j` will still apply, but the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will now represent the second set of values in the `sofas` list, corresponding to the index `j`.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the respective values from `sofas[1]`.**
