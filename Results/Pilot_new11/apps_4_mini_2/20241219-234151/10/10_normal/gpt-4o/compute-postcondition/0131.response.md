The variable `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `right_count`, `x1`, `x1_j`, `x2`, `j`, `d`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged except for the increment of `i` and `right_count[i]` which have already been affected by prior operations stated as the initial condition. Therefore, `left_count[i]` is now one greater.

Output State: **`left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `right_count[i]` is already incremented by 1 if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`; values of `j`, `d`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are unchanged and assigned from `sofas[1]`.**
