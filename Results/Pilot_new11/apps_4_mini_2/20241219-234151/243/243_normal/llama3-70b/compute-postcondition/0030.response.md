According to the code, since the loop condition is `while True`, it will always execute again regardless of the state of any variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop runs one more time.

State: **`n` is equal to `n // 5 + 1`, `ans` includes the previous elements plus the current value of `n`**
