In this case, the initial state indicates that we have a variable `n` which is defined as the result of `n // 5`. The code snippet provided indicates that `n` is being appended to a list called `ans`.

Since the operation `ans.append(n)` means we are adding the current value of `n` to the list `ans`, the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `n // 5`, `ans` includes the previous elements plus the current value of `n`.**
