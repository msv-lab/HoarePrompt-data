The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after executing `count += 1`, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables `m` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 2; `n` is 1.

Output State: **`m` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `count` is 2; `n` is 1**.
