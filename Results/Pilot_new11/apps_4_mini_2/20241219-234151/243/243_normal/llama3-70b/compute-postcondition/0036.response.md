In the given code, `print(len(ans))`, the function `len(ans)` calculates the length of the list `ans`. 

The initial state indicates that `n` is `n_final` and `ans` is a list of integers starting from 1 to `n_final - 1`. Therefore, `ans` will have `n_final - 1` elements.

The value of `count` is given as the maximum such that `1 // 5`, which results in `0` (since `1 // 5` performs integer division). However, this variable is not affected by the operation in the code.

Now calculating the output state:
- Since `ans` is a list starting from `1` to `n_final - 1`, its length is `n_final - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n_final`, `ans` is a list of integers from 1 to `n_final - 1`, `count` is 0, and the length of `ans` is `n_final - 1`.**
