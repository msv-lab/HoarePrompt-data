The variable `ans` is updated by appending the current value of `n`. The previous state indicates that `n` is equal to `n // 5 + 1`. By executing the code `ans.append(n)`, the current value of `n` is added to the `ans` list. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is equal to `n // 5 + 1`, `ans` includes the previous elements plus the current value of `n`, and the current value of `n` is appended to `ans`.**
