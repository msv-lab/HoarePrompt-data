Output State: **`left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, if `m` was achievable then `func_1(left) < m`, and `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `func_1(left)` never equals `m` for any value of `left` in the loop, the initial conditions must be satisfied with `left` being decremented until `func_1(left)` first becomes less than `m`.**
