Output State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + (N + 1)`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
