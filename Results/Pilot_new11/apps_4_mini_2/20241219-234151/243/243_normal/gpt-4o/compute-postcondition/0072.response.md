Output State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop executed and `func_1(left)` must be less than `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`.**
