The line of code assigns `high` the value of `mid - 1`. The current value of `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. As a result, the new value of `high` becomes `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`. 

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `high` while keeping the conditions of the remaining variables intact.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is equal to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the output of `func_1(mid)`; `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, and the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.**
