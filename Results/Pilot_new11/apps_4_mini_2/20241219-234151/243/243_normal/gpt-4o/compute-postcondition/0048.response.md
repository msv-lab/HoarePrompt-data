According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1(right)`. The loop will execute as long as `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`. Right before the loop, it is given that `right` is equal to `mid + 1`. 

Since `m` is a positive integer and it has been stated that `func_1(left) < m`, we need to check the state of `func_1(right)`. For the loop to execute for the first time, `func_1(right)` must evaluate to `m` as required. 

However, since `right` is currently equal to `mid + 1`, if `func_1(mid + 1)` does not equal `m`, then the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`, meaning we need to establish a condition that ensures `func_1(right)` evaluates to `m`.

The adjusted state is that the function `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.

State: **`left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + 1, and func_1(right) must equal m**
