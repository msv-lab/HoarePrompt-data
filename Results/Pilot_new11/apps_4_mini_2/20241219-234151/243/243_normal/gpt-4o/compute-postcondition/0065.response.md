The value of `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `left` will also take on that value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value for `left` in terms of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
