The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `low` and `high` must adhere to the condition that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. The value of `m` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
