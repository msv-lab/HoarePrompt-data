The value of `zeroes` is assigned the output of the function `func_1` with `mid` as an argument. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. Since `m` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, `mid` will yield a specific integer value, and this should be calculated as `mid = (5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected; they retain their previous values.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the output of `func_1(mid)`.**
