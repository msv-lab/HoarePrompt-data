`low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, we can express `mid` explicitly. Therefore, the calculation for `low` will result in a specific value. 

Since `zeroes` is still less than `m`, the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is the output of `func_1(mid)`; the current value of `zeroes` is less than `m`; `low` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`.**
