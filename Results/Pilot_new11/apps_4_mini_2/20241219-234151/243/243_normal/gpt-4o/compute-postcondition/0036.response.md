The value of `low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The variable `mid` is calculated as (low + high) // 2, and since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is guaranteed to be updated to a value that is either equal to or less than `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is updated to `mid + 1`; `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is `mid + 1`; `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`**.
