According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the function `func_1(left)` compared to the value `m`. Since `left` is adjusted to be one less than its previous value, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `func_1(left - 1)` to still equal `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `left` has already been decreased by 1, so we must ensure that `func_1(left)` equals `m` with this new value of `left`. Essentially, this means we require the function `func_1(left)` to equal `m` for the now decreased value of `left`. 

Therefore, we need to ensure `left` is such that calling `func_1(left)` (which is the previous value of `left + 1`) still results in `m`. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `left` must be such that func_1(left) must still equal m after being decreased by 1.**
