The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, we can infer that `high` will be decreased from its previous value. The exact preceding value of `high` is not specified in the problem, but it will now be one less than `mid`.

Since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, it remains valid, and `mid` will also be recalculated in subsequent code based on the new values of `low` and `high`. The value of `zeroes` remains unaffected in this code snippet.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `high` is mid - 1; `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`**.
