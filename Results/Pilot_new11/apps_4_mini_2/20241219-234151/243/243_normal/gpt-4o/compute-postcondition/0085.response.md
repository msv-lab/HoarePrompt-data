Output State: **`high` is less than `5 * (m + 1)`, `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains integers that correspond to the original value of `m` when passed through `func_1`, where the number of zeroes returned matches `m`. If `zeroes` was less than `m` in the last iteration, then `low` would have been updated to `mid + 1`; if `zeroes` was greater than `m`, `high` would have been updated to `mid - 1`. If `zeroes` were equal to `m`, the loops would finalize the `result` list to include the correct range around `mid`.`**
