Output State: **`left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + k` (for some integer k greater than 1), and `func_1(right)` must NOT equal m. The loop executes as long as `func_1(right)` is equal to m, indicating that `right` was incremented until `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`.**
