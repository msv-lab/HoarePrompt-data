According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, and it is specified that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute once more, `right` should remain such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

Since `func_1(right)` is already confirmed to equal `m` at the end of the previous iteration, there are no states that need to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can continue executing one more time.

State: **`left` is equal to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, and `func_1(right)` must equal m**
