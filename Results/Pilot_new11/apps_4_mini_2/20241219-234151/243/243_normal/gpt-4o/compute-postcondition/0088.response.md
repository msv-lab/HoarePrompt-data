Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000) and searches for all integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It utilizes a binary search strategy with a helper function `func_1` to count the trailing zeroes of `n!`. If it finds a range of integers that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it collects those integers into a list named `result`. If no such integers are found, the function returns an empty list. It is important to note that if `func_1` has not been adequately designed to handle the calculation of trailing zeroes for all potential `n`, this could lead to incomplete or incorrect results. Finally, the function returns the list of integers which reflect the extent of `m` trailing zeroes corresponding to their factorials.**
