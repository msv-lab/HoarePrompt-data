Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`. Otherwise, `left` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - k`, `mid` is reassigned as `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + (N + 1)`, and the control exits from the most internal loop or if statement.***
