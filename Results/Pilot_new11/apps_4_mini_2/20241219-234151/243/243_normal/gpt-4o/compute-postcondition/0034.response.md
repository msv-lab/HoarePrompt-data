The value of `mid` is assigned the result of the expression `(low + high) // 2`, which calculates the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the newly calculated value of `mid` based on the values of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2**
