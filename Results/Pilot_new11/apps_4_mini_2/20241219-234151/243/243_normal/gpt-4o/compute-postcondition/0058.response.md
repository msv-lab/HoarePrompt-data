Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000. If the number of zeroes is less than `m`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1`, and `high` remains unchanged with `mid` recalculated as (low + high) // 2, and `zeroes` is the result of `func_1(mid)`. Otherwise, if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, and `zeroes` is recalculated as the result of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` is set to the last value where `func_1(left)` was equal to `m`, and `right` is set to `mid + k` for some integer k greater than 1, upon exiting the most internal loop or condition. The range defined by `low` and `high` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `zeroes` compared to `m`.***
