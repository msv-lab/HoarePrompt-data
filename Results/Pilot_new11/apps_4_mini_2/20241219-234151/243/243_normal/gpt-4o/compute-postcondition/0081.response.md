The variable `result` is assigned a list generated by `range(left + 1, right)`. Here, `left` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - k`, and `right` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 + (N + 1)`. The output list will contain all integers starting from `left + 1` up to, but not including, `right`. 

As such, the previous values of `left` and `right` will inform the newly assigned value of `result`. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - k`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `right` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + (N + 1)` where `func_1(right)` equals `m` and `func_1(right - 1)` does not equal `m`.**
