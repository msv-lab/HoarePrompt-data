Initial State: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`; func_1(left) must be equal to `m`.

The code decrements the value of `left` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `(low + high) // 2 - 2`. The values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is assigned the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list `[]`; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 2`; func_1(left) must be equal to `m`.**
