According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is such that `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, indicating that the current value of `right` must be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since right was adjusted to `right + 1` after incrementing, the value of `right` must now correspond to a state where `func_1(right)` still equals `m`. This means `right` must be less than or equal to the value such that `func_1(right)` returns `m`.

Other state variables like `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, `zeroes` as provided, do not need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, but it is necessary to ensure that the current `right` state allows for `func_1(right)` to still equal `m`.

State: **`left` is a value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`; `result` is an empty list; `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`; `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`; and `right` must be adjusted to make `func_1(right)` equal to `m`.**
