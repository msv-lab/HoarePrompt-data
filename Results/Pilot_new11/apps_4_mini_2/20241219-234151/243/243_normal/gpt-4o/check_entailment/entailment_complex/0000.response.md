Correctness: **False**

The code fails to handle the case where there are no integers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes, particularly when m is not achievable. For example, if m = 5, the expected output is 0, but the function `func_2` does not account for this correctly in the binary search logic and the way `result` gets constructed, which would lead to an incorrect output in some cases. 

Moreover, while the annotations suggest that the program will correctly find values of n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeroes, they do not identify all edge cases or guarantee that the output will always conform to the requirement (e.g., providing a correct count of zeroes for all values). 

There are also potential issues when there are no n values that yield exactly m trailing zeroes, as noted in the examples provided in the problem description. Thus, the program does not strictly meet the problem's requirements in every possible case.
