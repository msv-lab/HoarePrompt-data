The function `func_1` receives a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`). It does this by counting how many times `n` can be divided by increasing powers of 5 (i.e., 5, 25, 125, ...). The result, stored in the variable `count`, represents the total count of trailing zeroes in `n!`. If `n` is less than 5, the function will return 0, as there cannot be any trailing zeroes. Therefore, the function correctly identifies the number of trailing zeroes for any non-negative integer, including edge cases where `n` is less than 5, returning an accurate count based on the integer divisions.
