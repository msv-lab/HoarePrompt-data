Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly handles the case where there are no vowels in the input string. According to the problem description, Grasshopper needs to jump on vowels to get to the end of the string. If the string contains no vowels at all, there are no valid positions for the Grasshopper to jump to, and thus it becomes impossible to complete the task. 

For example, for the input "BCDFGH", there are no vowels present, and the program would produce incorrect output. The code may end up printing a zero or some unintended value without addressing this edge case, thus failing to meet the problem's requirements comprehensively. 

This means the program does not fulfill the necessary conditions outlined in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is deemed false.
