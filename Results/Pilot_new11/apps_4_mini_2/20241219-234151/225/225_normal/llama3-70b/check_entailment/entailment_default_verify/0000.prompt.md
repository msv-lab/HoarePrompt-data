You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----
Input
ABABBBACFEYUKOTT

Output
4
Input
AAA

Output
1
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel != n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    print(max_jump)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program:

The task is to find the minimum jump ability the Grasshopper needs to reach the end of the string jumping only on the vowels.

### Code Breakdown:
1. The program identifies vowels from the input string using a predefined set `AEIOUY`.
2. It initializes `max_jump` to zero and `last_vowel` to -1.
3. It iterates through each character of the string. If the character is a vowel:
   - If it is the first vowel found (`last_vowel == -1`), it calculates the maximum jump as the position of the vowel plus one (the position after the vowel).
   - If it is not the first vowel, it calculates the jump based on the distance from the last vowel.
4. After iterating through the string, if the last vowel is not at the end of the string, it calculates the maximum jump again from the last vowel to the end of the string.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum calculated jump ability.

### Potential Incorrect Cases:
To check the correctness, we can think of various input scenarios:

1. **Case with no vowels:**
   Input: `"BCDFG"`
   - The output should be 6 (the length of the string, as the Grasshopper starts before the first character and cannot jump to vowels). 
   - However, the current code will treat this as having no vowels and will return 0 instead because it never sets `max_jump`.

2. **Case with a string full of vowels:**
   Input: `"AAAA"`
   - The output should be 1 (Grasshopper can jump from start to one vowel to another).
   - The code correctly calculates this.

3. **Case with a mix of vowels and consonants:**
   Input: `"AABACAEAI"`, the expected jump is 2. The Grasshopper can jump from A to A, and from A to A.
   - It seems the code can handle this appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the case when there are no vowels in the string, it does not fulfill the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 characters. It calculates the maximum jump length based on the positions of the vowels (A, E, I, O, U, Y) in the string. If the last vowel is not the last character in the string, it also considers the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. The maximum jump length is then printed. The function does not handle cases where the string might contain no vowels, but it correctly handles scenarios where vowels are present and the last vowel occurs at various positions in the string. The final state of the program includes the printed maximum jump length that reflects the calculated jump based on the input string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
