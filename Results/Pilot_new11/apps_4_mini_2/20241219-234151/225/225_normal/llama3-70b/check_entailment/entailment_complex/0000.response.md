Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper as defined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Jump Calculation**: According to the problem description, the Grasshopper must be able to jump to every vowel present in the string to reach the end. The jump ability is defined as the maximum distance he can jump to reach the next vowel. The program attempts to calculate this maximum jump distance by averaging the distance between vowels, which does not reflect the problem's requirements accurately.

2. **Initial Jump Condition**: The logic used to set `max_jump` initially calculates the distance from the starting position to the first vowel, using `i + 1`. This value doesn't directly represent a correct jump ability; it needs to be 1 less than the index distance to account for how jumps are made.

3. **Final Position Calculation**: The adjustment for the possibility that the last vowel is not the last character in the string is also incorrect. The program calculates `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which does not represent the correct necessary jump to reach the end of the string.

4. **Vowel Absence**: Although the problem guarantees there are vowels present in the string, the program's handling of the absence of vowels is flawed. If the conditions were different, and the check for vowels (`last_vowel`) was never set, the output would not make sense.

Overall, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements of calculating the Grasshopper's minimum jump ability to reach the end of the string strictly by jumping on vowels. The incorrect logic will lead to erroneous outputs for various input strings, making the program unsuitable according to the specified requirements.
