The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(s)`, which is the length of the input string `s`. Since `s` is an input string of capital English letters, `n` will take on the value of the number of letters in `s`. The value of `vowels` remains unchanged as 'AEIOUY'.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of capital English letters; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`.**
