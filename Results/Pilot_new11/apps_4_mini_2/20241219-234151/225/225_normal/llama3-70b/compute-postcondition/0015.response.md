The variable `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i + 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 2. The previous value of `max_jump` is unknown, but it will be updated to the greater of `max_jump` and 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `max_jump` is updated to the maximum value of its current state and 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, 2)**
