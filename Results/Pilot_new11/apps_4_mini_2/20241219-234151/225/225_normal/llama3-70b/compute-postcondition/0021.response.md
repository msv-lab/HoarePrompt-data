In the given code snippet, `max_jump` is being updated to the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. The initial states indicate that `i` is 2. However, the previous value of `max_jump` is unknown.

Here's the analysis:

- The value of `i` is explicitly provided as 2.
- Thus, `i + 1` equals 3.
- The expression `max(max_jump, i + 1)` will return the greater of `max_jump` or 3.

Since the value of `max_jump` is not provided, we cannot determine a specific value for it after the operation. Therefore, we can only describe the outcome based on the information we have.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, 3).**
