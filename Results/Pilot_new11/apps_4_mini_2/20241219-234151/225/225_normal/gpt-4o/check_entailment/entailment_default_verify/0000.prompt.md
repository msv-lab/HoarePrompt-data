You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----

Output

Input
AAA

Output
1
Program:
```
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1(s)` and determine if it meets the requirements stated. 

The problem description indicates that the Grasshopper can only jump on vowels, and we need to determine the minimum jump ability to overcome the string. 

Let's go through the code:

1. The function initializes a set of vowels: `vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}`.
2. It initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1. 
3. It then iterates through each character in the string.
4. If the character is a vowel, it calculates the distance from the previous vowel position to the current one, updating `max_jump` if this distance is larger.
5. After exiting the loop, it checks the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
6. Finally, it returns the value of `max_jump`.

Potential edge cases to consider:
- If the string consists entirely of consonants, the Grasshopper cannot land on any vowels. This case is not explicitly handled in the code. If we input a string like "BCDFGH", the function will not update `prev_pos` because there are no vowels and will ultimately return `len(s) - (-1)`, which equals `7`, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The correct behavior would be to return a value indicating it is impossible to jump over the string.

Since the program fails in this edge case, I'll conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The case where the string contains no vowels demonstrates that the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements. The Grasshopper cannot make any jumps if no vowels are present in the string.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters and calculates the maximum distance between consecutive vowels within the string. If no vowels are found, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the maximum distance either between vowels or from the last vowel to the end of the string. Notably, if the string contains no vowels, the return value does not reflect the length of the string minus the index of a last vowel (as stated in the return postconditions), but simply defaults to returning 1. The final state of the program thus includes returning this calculated maximum distance based on the presence and positions of vowels in the input string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
