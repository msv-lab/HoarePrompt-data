Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where there are no vowels in the string. According to the problem description, it is required to compute the minimum jump ability needed to reach the end of the string while only jumping on vowels. If there are no vowels, the Grasshopper cannot make any jumps, and therefore there should be a clear handling of this case.

The program is designed to return 1 if no vowels are found (`max_jump` defaults to 1), suggesting that the Grasshopper can jump over an empty distance. However, without any vowels, it would be impossible for the Grasshopper to progress across the string, thus violating the logic of the problem. The function should ideally return a value that reflects an infinite jump requirement or indicate that it's impossible to proceed.

For example:
- Input: `BCDFG`
- Expected Output: **Infeasible** (or some maximum representation indicating the inability to jump)
- Actual Output: `1` (which is misleading)

Thus, since the code does not account for this case appropriately where no vowels exist, the correctness of the implementation fails.
