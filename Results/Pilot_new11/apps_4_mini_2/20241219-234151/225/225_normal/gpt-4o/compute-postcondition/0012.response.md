According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the string `s`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `s` is a non-empty string, its length is at least 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `prev_pos` will be updated to the new value of `i`, which is 2. We do not have any information about the length of `s`, but since it's a non-empty string, it must be at least 2 for the loop to run again.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is updated to 2; length of `s` must be at least 2**
