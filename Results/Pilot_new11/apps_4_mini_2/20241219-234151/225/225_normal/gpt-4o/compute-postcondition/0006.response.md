In the given scenario, the `prev_pos` variable is assigned the value of `i`, which is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation. 

The output state reflects the updated value of `prev_pos`, and retains the states of the other variables as they are. 

Thus, the updated variables and their values are:
- `prev_pos` is 0 (since `i` is 0).
- `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `i` remains 0.
- `max_jump` remains as `max(max_jump, 0 - prev_pos)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 0, `prev_pos` is 0, `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 0 - prev_pos)**
