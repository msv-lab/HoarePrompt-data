In the provided code, `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value or the result of `i - prev_pos`. The value of `i` is currently 0, and since the character at index `i` in `s` is a vowel, it is implied that `prev_pos` is some previous position in the string `s`. The value of `max_jump` is modified based on this calculation, but we do not have the specific values of `max_jump` or `prev_pos`. 

Thus, the output state will include:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `i` remains 0.
- The new value of `max_jump` is either its previous value or the value of `i - prev_pos`, which is `0 - prev_pos`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 0, `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 0 - prev_pos)**.
