The list `bits` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `n` and `k` maintain their original values, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`; `bits` is an empty list.**
