The code `bits.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `bits`. The initial value of `bits` is [60], and `i` is 59. After executing the code, `bits` will now contain two values: 60 and 59. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the values [60, 59], and `i` is 59.**
