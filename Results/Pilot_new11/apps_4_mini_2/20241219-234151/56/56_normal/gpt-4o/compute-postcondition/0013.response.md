Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` is a list containing the value [60], and `i` is 58. If the bit at position 58 of `n` is set (i.e., `n` >> 58 & 1 evaluates to true), then `bits` is updated to include 58, otherwise there is no else part to execute.***
