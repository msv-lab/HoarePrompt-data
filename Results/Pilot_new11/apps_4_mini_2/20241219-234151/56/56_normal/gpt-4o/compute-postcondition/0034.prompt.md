You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No' because the current value of k is greater than n, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` contains all the indices of the set bits in `n` (ranging from 0 to 60). If no bits are set, `bits` is an empty list.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No', indicating that there are more indices of the set bits in 'n' than the value of 'k', despite 'k' being a positive integer and less than or equal to 'n', and the fact that the length of 'bits' is greater than 'k'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` contains all the indices of the set bits in `n` (ranging from 0 to 60), and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`. If no bits are set, `bits` is an empty list.
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `len(bits)` is equal to `k`, `bits` contains set indices from the range of original `smallest - 1` values down to some minimum based on how many times the loop iterated, `smallest` has been decremented several times depending on how many times the loop executed, and `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). If `k` was initially greater than the length of `bits`, then the loop would have executed enough times to finalize `bits`'s length to exactly `k`.
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #The program returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted elements of 'bits' as a space-separated string
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k` and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n`, or if the number of set bits in `n` exceeds `k`. If the number of set bits is less than or equal to `k`, it returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted indices of the set bits as a space-separated string.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No' because the current value of k is greater than n, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5)

Case_2: The program returns 'No', indicating that there are more indices of the set bits in 'n' than the value of 'k', despite 'k' being a positive integer and less than or equal to 'n', and the fact that the length of 'bits' is greater than 'k'

Case_3: The program returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted elements of 'bits' as a space-separated string


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
