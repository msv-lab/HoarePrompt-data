You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we will analyze the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Input Conditions**:
    - Two integers `n` and `k`.
    - The goal is to find k integers such that their powers of 2 sum up to `n`, with the largest integer minimized and the result being lexicographically largest.

2. **Output Conditions**:
    - If such a sequence exists, output "Yes" followed by the sequence.
    - If it does not exist, output "No".

### Code Analysis:

1. **Early Return for Impossible Cases**:
    - The code checks if `k > n`, returning "No" immediately if this condition holds. This is correct because if we need more parts than the sum, it's impossible to achieve.

2. **Finding Bit Positions**:
    - The program populates `bits` with the indices of bits set in `n`, iterating from 60 down to 0. This is appropriate as powers of 2 up to \(2^{60}\) cover the given range (up to \(10^{18}\)).

3. **Checking Number of Bits**:
    - If the number of bits found exceeds `k`, it outputs "No", which is also correct: if we have too few parts to create `n`, we cannot do so.

4. **Generating the Sequence**:
    - If there are fewer bits than `k`, the program tries to expand the smallest bit by creating two `smallest-1` entries, effectively splitting the power into two lower powers which still sum to the same value.
    - This continues until the number of bits reaches `k`.

5. **Sorting the Sequence**:
    - Finally, the bits are sorted in descending order to ensure the result satisfies the lexicographical largest condition.

### Potential Problem Cases:

1. **Handling of Zero and Negative Powers**:
    - The current output logic could lead to invalid or unexpected outputs if the expansion on divisions leads to negative powers (which happen for `k > number of non-zero bits`). This means the algorithm could push powers below zero which are invalid as per the problem's requirement when summing up. 

Example case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
   - Here, `n` can be represented as \(2^1 + 2^0 = 2 + 1\). The program identifies enough bits, but when trying to create more entries (to fulfill `k=4`), it might produce invalid entries such as `-1`, `-1`, `-1`, and `-1`.
   - Output: "Yes\n-1 -1 -1 -1" (would be incorrect as negative powers are not valid in this context).

### Conclusion:
The program misses case handling where additional entries of negative powers could be produced when `k` is greater than available representations of `n`, leading to an incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No' because the current value of k is greater than n, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` contains all the indices of the set bits in `n` (ranging from 0 to 60). If no bits are set, `bits` is an empty list.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No', indicating that there are more indices of the set bits in 'n' than the value of 'k', despite 'k' being a positive integer and less than or equal to 'n', and the fact that the length of 'bits' is greater than 'k'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` contains all the indices of the set bits in `n` (ranging from 0 to 60), and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`. If no bits are set, `bits` is an empty list.
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `len(bits)` is equal to `k`, `bits` contains set indices from the range of original `smallest - 1` values down to some minimum based on how many times the loop iterated, `smallest` has been decremented several times depending on how many times the loop executed, and `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). If `k` was initially greater than the length of `bits`, then the loop would have executed enough times to finalize `bits`'s length to exactly `k`.
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #The program returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted elements of 'bits' as a space-separated string
