You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program relative to the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

1. **Initialization**: The code reads `n` and `k` from input. It then checks if `k` is greater than `n`, in which case it returns "No". This is the correct check because if we require more parts than the sum itself, it's impossible to decompose `n` into `k` integers whose powers of two sum to `n`.

2. **Bits Extraction**: The program extracts the indices of the set bits in the binary representation of `n`. It uses a loop from 60 down to 0 to check each bit. This should correctly populate the list `bits` with the values of the powers of two that sum to `n`.

3. **Condition on Length of `bits`**: Here, the program checks if the length of `bits` (the number of distinct powers of 2 used) is greater than `k`. If it is, it returns "No". This condition also seems correct, as it means there are more unique powers required than the length of the sequence allowed.

4. **Adjusting to Length `k`**: The core logic that handles adjusting bits involves:
   - Popping the smallest element from `bits` (the smallest power of two that contributes to `n`).
   - Reducing this power by 1 and appending it twice to `bits`.
   - This process is repeated until the length of `bits` is equal to `k`.

   The above logic does work in theory but fails to ensure that:
   - The newly added powers must still be able to form valid powers of 2, adhering to possible negative powers, to sum back to `n`. This is critical, as powers of 2 less than `0` (e.g., -1) represent fractional values, potentially invalid combinations when forming integer sums.
   - Ensuring lexicographical order is fulfilled is dependent on the order of how bits are generated and manipulated.

5. **Sorting for Correct Output**: Finally, the code sorts `bits` in descending order. This is important for achieving the lexicographically largest sequence.

### Testing Example:
Consider the input `n = 1` and `k = 2`. The program should output "Yes" and provide a sequence. The correct output should be `-1 -1` because the only way to sum up `2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1`. 

However, if `k = 2`, the program will reach this condition:
- After finding that `len(bits)` is less than `k`, it will try to append some `-1` values to `bits`. Since there's a mismatch in our logic handling the powers, it may not yield the appropriate values.

Let’s look at additional potential inputs:

- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 1`. This should return "Yes" and `1` because `2^1` is the only success as sum to `2` with `k = 1`. However, it may return "No" incorrectly if handled improperly.
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 2`. This also returns should return "Yes" with values like `1 0` which can represent `2^1 + 2^0 = 3`, but the behavior depends on how the bits are processed.

The processing detail for negative powers and ensuring they remain valid for integer representation based on the len(k) configurations where `2<num` needs extra handling.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, we conclude that the program fails to correctly handle the edge cases involving negative powers. The logic does not ensure the sufficiency of the sum representation for all possibilities of powers, which could lead to scenarios where it incorrectly returns valid cases for `n` while not truly being valid.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No' because the current value of k is greater than n, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` contains all the indices of the set bits in `n` (ranging from 0 to 60). If no bits are set, `bits` is an empty list.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No', indicating that there are more indices of the set bits in 'n' than the value of 'k', despite 'k' being a positive integer and less than or equal to 'n', and the fact that the length of 'bits' is greater than 'k'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` contains all the indices of the set bits in `n` (ranging from 0 to 60), and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`. If no bits are set, `bits` is an empty list.
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `len(bits)` is equal to `k`, `bits` contains set indices from the range of original `smallest - 1` values down to some minimum based on how many times the loop iterated, `smallest` has been decremented several times depending on how many times the loop executed, and `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). If `k` was initially greater than the length of `bits`, then the loop would have executed enough times to finalize `bits`'s length to exactly `k`.
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #The program returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted elements of 'bits' as a space-separated string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^18) and `k` (a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000). It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of indices of set bits in `n` exceeds `k`. If the number of indices of set bits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it modifies the list of bit indices by adding decremented values until the list length equals `k`. Finally, it returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted list of these bit indices as a space-separated string. The function effectively checks the relationship between `n` and `k`, the number of set bits in `n`, and adjusts the indices of these bits as per the condition applied.
