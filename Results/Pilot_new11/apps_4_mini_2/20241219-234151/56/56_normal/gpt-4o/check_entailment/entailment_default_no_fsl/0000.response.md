Correctness: **False**

The program fails for cases when `n` is less than `k` but has sufficient powers of two to make up that sum. Specifically, if `n` is less than `k` but can be constructed using negative powers of two, the program incorrectly returns 'No'. For example:

Input:
```
2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
Yes
-1 -1 0
```
Reasoning: `2^{-1} + 2^{-1} + 2^{0} = 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 2`, yet the program outputs 'No', indicating that the sequence cannot be formed, which is incorrect.

The program also does not correctly handle cases where `k` is larger than the number of set bits in `n`, potentially leading to situations where it does not balance the bit manipulation properly to achieve the desired sum. Therefore, since there are at least some cases where it does not meet the problem description's requirements, this leads to the conclusion that the correctness is indeed false.
