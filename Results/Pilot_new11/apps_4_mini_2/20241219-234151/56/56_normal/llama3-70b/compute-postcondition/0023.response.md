The code contains a `break` statement, which does not change any variable values but exits the nearest enclosing loop or statement. Thus, the values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must remain greater than 0; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
