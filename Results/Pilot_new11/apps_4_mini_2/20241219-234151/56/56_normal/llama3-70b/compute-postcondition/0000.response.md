The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input received by the program, where `map(int, input().split())` takes the input, splits it, and converts each part into an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\), both `n` and `k` will take specific integer values from user input.

The output state will reflect that `n` and `k` have been updated to these specific input values. The other variables' states remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to input value, `k` is a positive integer equal to input value.**
