Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0), `k` is the original positive integer, `a` is a list containing the values of `x` collected during the iterations, `i` is the total number of iterations executed (which corresponds to how many times `x` was appended to `a`), and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `k`. For each iteration, `x` was equal to the bit length of the previous value of `n` minus 1.***
