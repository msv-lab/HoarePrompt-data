Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value and `k` is a positive integer equal to the input value. If `n` is less than `k`, then 'No' has been printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the list `a` retains its current values if its length is less than `k`. Otherwise, `a` contains the first `k` values sorted in descending order, and 'Yes' has been printed to the console as a space-separated string of the values in `a`.***
