You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic encapsulated in the `func()` function.

The problem requires Luba to minimize the time spent closing tabs that are not in the range [l, r]. The logic implemented in the code must reflect this requirement accurately for all possible inputs defined by the constraints.

### Code Analysis

1. **When `pos < l`:**
    - Luba is initially to the left of the segment she wants to keep open. The program correctly calculates the number of seconds needed to move from `pos` to `l` (which is `l - pos`).

2. **When `pos > r`:**
    - Luba is initially to the right of the segment. Similarly, the program correctly calculates the number of seconds needed to move from `pos` to `r` (which is `pos - r`).

3. **When `l <= pos <= r`:**
    - If Luba is already within the desired segment [l, r], ideally she should not need to do any movement to get to the segment she's supposed to keep open. Hence, the program does not consider this directly in any of the conditions since the movements mentioned logically handle movement left or right only if she's outside.

4. **Closing Tabs Logic:**
    - The expression `min(pos - 1, n - r)` represents the minimum time it takes to close all tabs to the left of the segment (i.e., from `pos` moving toward tab 1). The maximum between 0 and `l - 1` is the time it would take to close all tabs to the left of `l`, ensuring that no invalid moves are made when `l` is already at 1.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Case when `pos` is directly next to `l` or `r`:**
   - If, for example, `pos = l - 1`, it should check that moving and closing the left tab (if any) adds the correct amount of time.

2. **Case when `n = 1`:**
   - When there is only one tab (`n = 1`), and `l = 1` and `r = 1`, the program should correctly return 0 as no operations are needed.

3. **Case when `l` and `r` encompass all tabs:**
   - For example, if `n = 5`, `pos = 3`, `l = 1`, and `r = 5`, it should return 0 since all tabs need to stay open.

After analyzing the provided code and each condition, we can observe that:

- It doesn't account for the scenario where no operations are needed when `l <= pos <= r`. The program incorrectly calculates movements even when Luba is already in the range.

### Conclusion
Thus, the program fails in situations where Luba is already located within the segment [l, r], and it does not differentiate this case correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates an integer result based on the parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, representing boundaries and a current position within a range of numbers from 1 to `n`. It determines how far `pos` is from the defined boundaries, incrementing the result (`ans`) accordingly based on whether `pos` lies outside the range defined by `l` and `r`. Specifically, if `pos` is less than `l`, it adds the difference to `ans`. If `pos` is greater than `r`, it also adds the difference to `ans`. Then, it adds the smaller of `pos - 1` or `n - r`, which accounts for the distance to the start or the end of the range, as well as the maximum of `0` or `l - 1`, which ensures the result accounts for positions before `l`. The function ultimately prints out the computed value of `ans`, which summarizes how far the position is from optimal boundaries, including edge cases where the `pos` is at extreme ends or exactly on the boundaries.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
