The code snippet prints the value of `ans`, but does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged. We simply output the state reflecting that `ans` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos` is an integer (1 ≤ pos < l ≤ n), `l` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), `r` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), `ans` is printed**.
