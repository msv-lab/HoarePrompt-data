The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The other variables retain their previous values without any changes from the code provided. The constraints for `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` remain valid after this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is 0.**
