You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Original Assessment: To ascertain the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the implementation step-by-step based on the problem description.

The problem requires Luba to close tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The program calculates how many seconds are needed to do this based on the current position of the cursor.

1. **Case when `l == 1 and r == n`**: This means all tabs need to remain open. The program correctly outputs `0` because no action is needed.

2. **Case when `l == 1`**: Here only the right side needs to be closed. The seconds required are computed as `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which accounts for the time to move to tab `r` and then close all tabs to the right. This logic appears correct.

3. **Case when `r == n`**: In this case, only tabs on the left side need to be closed. The seconds required are computed as `abs(pos - l) + 1`, which corresponds to the time to move to tab `l` and then close all tabs to the left. This logic also seems correct.

4. **General Case**: When both sides need closing (neither `l` is 1 nor `r` is `n`), the program computes the time needed to move to either `l` or `r` and then the time to close the tabs. The calculation `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` appears to incorporate all necessary moves well.

However, we must scrutinize the implementation more rigorously and consider edge cases. A noteworthy concern is if the cursor is positioned very close or within the segment:

### Critical Test Case
Let's consider the input `5 3 2 4`:
- Expected Behavior: With cursor at position 3, Luba needs to close tabs on the left (1) and the right (5). The expected steps would be to move to tab 2, close left, move to tab 3 (optional since it's within [2, 4]), and close right (tab 5). This would take 3 seconds in total (1 second to close left and 1 second to close right + 1 move).
- Expected Output: 3 seconds, however, the code outputs `min(abs(3 - 2) + (4 - 2 + 2), abs(3 - 4) + (4 - 2 + 2)) => min(1 + 4, 1 + 4) => 5`.

This particular scenario indicates a clear miscalculation. 

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly and can generate incorrect results as demonstrated. Thus:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer between 1 and n, l is an integer between 1 and n, and r is an integer between l and n, representing the segment of tabs that need to remain open.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :
            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
                close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
                print(close_both_sides)
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` and is less than `n`. If `r` is equal to `n`, the output of the calculation is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which has been printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` which is not both equal to `1` and `n`, then the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which evaluates to an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l` is greater than 1, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` and less than `n`; if `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`, which has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. If `l` is 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the output is 0. If `l` equals 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is less than `n`, the values `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, and the value `close_both_sides` equals `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads four integers from input: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to make a segment of tabs defined by indices `l` to `r` closed, based on the current position `pos`. The function handles special cases: if the entire range [1, n] is open, it prints 0; if only one end (either `l` or `r`) is at the bounds, it computes moves accordingly. For cases where both `l` and `r` are not on the edges, it calculates the moves required to close both ends of the segment and prints the minimum moves considering the distance to both edges. The output is always a non-negative integer, representing the number of actions needed to achieve the desired state.
