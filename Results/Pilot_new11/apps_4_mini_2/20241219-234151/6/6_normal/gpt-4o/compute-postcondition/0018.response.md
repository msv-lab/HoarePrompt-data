Functionality: **The function reads four integers from input: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to make a segment of tabs defined by indices `l` to `r` closed, based on the current position `pos`. The function handles special cases: if the entire range [1, n] is open, it prints 0; if only one end (either `l` or `r`) is at the bounds, it computes moves accordingly. For cases where both `l` and `r` are not on the edges, it calculates the moves required to close both ends of the segment and prints the minimum moves considering the distance to both edges. The output is always a non-negative integer, representing the number of actions needed to achieve the desired state.**
