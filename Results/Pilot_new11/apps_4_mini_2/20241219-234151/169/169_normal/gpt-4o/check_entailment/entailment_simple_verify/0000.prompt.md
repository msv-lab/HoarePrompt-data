You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----
Input

Output

Input

++++

Output

Input

++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    stones = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones = max(0, stones - 1)
    print(stones)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, we can analyze the logic implemented in the function `func()` and how it corresponds to the problem description.

The problem states that Vasya performs a series of operations where he either adds or removes stones, and we need to find the minimal possible number of stones remaining after these operations under the constraints given.

### Program Breakdown:
1. The program reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` which consists of `+` and `-` characters.
2. It initializes a variable `stones` to zero to keep track of the number of stones.
3. It iterates through each operation in the string `s`:
   - If the operation is `+`, it increases the count of stones by 1.
   - If the operation is `-`, it decreases the count of stones by 1, but not below zero (i.e., it uses `max(0, stones - 1)`).

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic of the program prevents `stones` from becoming negative, which adheres to the requirement that Vasya must not take a stone when the pile is empty.
- However, the program does not take into account the minimum number of stones required at the beginning to satisfy all the `-` operations without falling below zero.

### Potential Issue:
Let's consider a case where the number of `-` operations exceeds the number of `+` operations during the simulation without enforcing the initial minimum stones condition:

#### Example Case:
- Input: 
  ```
  5
  ---++
  ```
- Here:
  - We have 3 `-` operations and 2 `+` operations.
- Expected Minimum Stones:
  - To perform 3 `-` operations without running out of stones, Vasya would need at least 3 stones at the beginning to start.
- Calculation:
  - The program counts how many stones would remain after the operations and would output `0` because `max(0, 0 - 3 + 2) = max(0, -1) = 0`, which does not account for the fact that he needed at least 3 stones initially.

### Conclusion:
Because the program fails to properly account for the minimum initial stones required based on the counts of `-` and `+` operations, it can yield incorrect results in cases where there are more `-` operations than `+` operations, leading to potentially incorrect answers.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string consisting of n characters, each character being either '-' or '+'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    stones = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones = max(0, stones - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+' characters; `stones` is equal to the net effect of all operations in `s`, representing the count of stones accumulated, with a minimum value of 0.
    print(stones)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
