Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+', `stones` is 0, and `operation` is the first character in `s`, which is equal to '-' after executing the program. The value of `stones` remains 0 because the operation decrements stones but it is constrained by the `max` function, preventing it from going below zero.***
