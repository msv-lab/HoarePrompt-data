Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "-" and "+"; if the count of '-' in `s` is greater than the count of '+' in `s`, a value of 0 has been printed. Otherwise, the output value is `plus_count - minus_count`, where the count of '-' is less than or equal to the count of '+'.***
