The code `minus_count = s.count('-')` counts the occurrences of the character `'-'` in the input string `s`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The output state should reflect that `minus_count` now holds the value of the count of `'-'` characters in the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`.**
