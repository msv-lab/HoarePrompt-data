Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly account for all possible scenarios as per the problem description. Specifically, it does not consider cases where the number of "-" operations exceeds the number of "+" operations in a way that could lead to needing to have more stones initially than just what the operations imply.

For example, in the case where `n = 5` and `s = "---++"`:

- The program counts the "-" (3) and "+" (2).
- The output from the program would be `0` because `minus_count` (3) is greater than `plus_count` (2).

However, according to the problem's semantics, Vasya would need at least 3 stones originally to even perform 3 consecutive "-" operations. As a result, the minimal possible number of stones after the operations should be `3 + (0) = 3`, instead of `0`.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirement for correct outputs across all potential edge cases and is marked incorrect.
