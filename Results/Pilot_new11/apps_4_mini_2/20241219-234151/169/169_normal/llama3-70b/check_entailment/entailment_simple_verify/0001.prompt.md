You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
---

Output
0
Input
4
++++

Output
4
Input
2
-+

Output
1
Input
5
++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze how it handles the requirements of the problem statement.

The program counts the number of operations denoted by `+` (adding stones) and `-` (removing stones). Based on these counts, it determines the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing all operations.

1. **Counting Operations**:
   - It uses `s.count('-')` to count the take operations (removing stones).
   - It uses `s.count('+')` to count the add operations (adding stones).

2. **Logic for Result**:
   - If the number of `-` operations (take operations) exceeds the number of `+` operations (add operations), it prints `0`, which implies that the operations cannot lead to a negative pile.
   - If the number of `+` operations is greater than or equal to `-`, it calculates the difference `plus_count - minus_count` and prints that value.

### Case Analysis:

Let's analyze the potential edge cases that might not be handled correctly:

- **Example Input**: `n = 1` with `s = "-"` (only one operation to take).
  - The program will count `minus_count = 1` and `plus_count = 0`:
    - It prints `0`, which is correct since you cannot take from an empty pile. 

- **Example Input**: `n = 1` with `s = "+"` (only one operation to add).
  - The program will count `minus_count = 0` and `plus_count = 1`:
    - It prints `1`, which is correct since it can be assumed there were no stones initially and one stone is added.

- **Where it might fail**:
  - Consider the input where `n = 5` and `s = "-----"`. 
    - The program would count `minus_count = 5` and `plus_count = 0`, leading it to print `0`. However, starting from 0 stones, it's impossible to make 5 take operations (`-`) as it would lead to a negative count. Therefore, the program does not correctly account for situations where not enough stones exist to perform all operations. 
   
Overall, the program does not cover the case where the number of take operations exceeds the initial count of stones in the pile. 

Thus, we find that the program does not satisfy the requirement as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "-" and "+".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if (minus_count > plus_count) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(plus_count - minus_count)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "-" and "+"; if the count of '-' in `s` is greater than the count of '+' in `s`, a value of 0 has been printed. Otherwise, the output value is `plus_count - minus_count`, where the count of '-' is less than or equal to the count of '+'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
