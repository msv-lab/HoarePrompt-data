The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate under the constraint that `n` must be an integer in the range of 2 to 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament. However, since there are no specific return cases or output descriptions provided, the functionality is unclear in terms of what it returns based on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is yet to be defined with respect to the output based on the value of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not specified based on the value of n.**
