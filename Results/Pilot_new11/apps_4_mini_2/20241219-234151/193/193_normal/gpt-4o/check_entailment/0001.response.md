Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting from side length `x` by the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. However, this logic is fundamentally flawed for several scenarios.

For example, consider the case where `x = 5` and `y = 3`. According to the problem, to transition from a triangle of side length 5 (`(5, 5, 5)`) to a triangle of side length 3, one possible sequence of modifications is:

1. `(5, 5, 5) -> (5, 5, 3)`
2. `(5, 5, 3) -> (5, 3, 3)`
3. `(5, 3, 3) -> (3, 3, 3)`

The expected number of modifications here is 3. However, if we apply the provided formula:
```
(5 - 3) // 2 + (5 - 3) % 2 = 2 // 2 + 2 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1
```
This indicates 1 modification, which is incorrect.

Thus, since the formula does not produce the correct result for all potential cases, the program fails to meet the requirement of the problem description.
