According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the current value of `pos` relative to `T_pos`. The loop iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos`, with a step of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `pos` is currently equal to `G_pos + k * m` for some integer `m`, where this value is still less than or equal to `T_pos`.

To execute the loop one more time, `pos` would need to increment by `k`. Therefore, it would become `pos + k`. For the next iteration of the loop to occur, `pos + k` must still be less than or equal to `T_pos`.

The minimum requirements are:
- `pos` should still be less than `T_pos`.
- The new value of `pos` after increment, `pos + k`, must still reach towards `T_pos`.

Given the above logic:
- `pos` will become `pos + k`.

Hence, the updated state must reflect this new position for `pos`, keeping `n`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and `reachable` unchanged as they were defined to ensure the loop can continue iteratively until the condition fails.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;` `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the position of 'G'; `T_pos` is the position of 'T'; and `pos` is `G_pos + 2k` (assuming `pos + k` to still be less than or equal to `T_pos`), reachable remains unchanged.**
