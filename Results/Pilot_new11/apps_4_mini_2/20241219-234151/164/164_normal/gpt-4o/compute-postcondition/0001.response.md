The variable `line` is assigned the value of the string input, which is of length `n`. The specific content of `line` will depend on the input provided. Other variables retain their previous constraints: `n` remains an integer within the bounds of 2 to 100, and `k` remains an integer from 1 to `n - 1`. The precondition concerning `line` being a string of length `n` consisting of specific characters is also upheld.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1; `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.**
