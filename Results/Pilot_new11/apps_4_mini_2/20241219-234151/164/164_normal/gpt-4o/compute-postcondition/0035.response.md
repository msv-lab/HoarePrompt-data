Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `n` (the length of a string) and `k` (the step size), along with a string `line` of length `n` containing the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. The function determines whether the character 'G' can reach the character 'T' by making steps of size `k` without encountering the character '#'. If 'G' can reach 'T' without hitting '#', the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles cases where 'G' and 'T' may be in reversed order, ensuring correct evaluation regardless of their positions. It does not account for input validation beyond the initial assumptions about bounds on `n` and `k`, nor does it check for the presence of exactly one 'G' and one 'T' in the string.**
