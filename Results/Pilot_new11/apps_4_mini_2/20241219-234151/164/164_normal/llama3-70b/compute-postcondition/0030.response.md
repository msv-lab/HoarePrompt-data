Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` (which can be -1) and `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` (which can also be -1). If either 'G' or 'T' is not present in `s`, "NO" has been printed. Otherwise, if both characters are present, and the absolute difference `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k` with no '#' characters in the specified positions, then "YES" has been printed; otherwise, "NO" has been printed.***
