According to the code, whether the loop can execute again is determined by the value of `i` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` satisfies the condition 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop can potentially execute again as long as `i` remains less than `n`. 

Since `i` is incremented each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` would be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, the values of `g` and `t` may depend on the character at index `i` of string `s` during the next iteration. However, we can state that `g` and `t` remain determined by the rules based on the character encountered.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, the state changes would be: 
- `i` must be 2,
- `n` remains unchanged,
- `s` remains the same, 
- the specific values for `g` and `t` would depend on the character at index `i` of string `s`, which we cannot specify directly without additional information.

State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G'**.
