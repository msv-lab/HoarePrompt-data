Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `s` is a string of length `n`; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`, and `g` is not equal to -1; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`, and `t` is not equal to -1. The absolute difference between `t` and `g` is not divisible by `k`, or there exists an index `i` such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#' for at least one `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`.***
