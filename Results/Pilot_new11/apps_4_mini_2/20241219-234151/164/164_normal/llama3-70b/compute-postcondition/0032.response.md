Functionality: **The function determines if a grasshopper can reach a target insect based on their positions in a given string. It accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (length of the string) and an integer `k` (the hop distance). The string includes characters representing obstacles, the grasshopper's starting position ('G'), and the target position ('T'). The function outputs "YES" if the grasshopper can reach the target by hopping `k` spaces without encountering obstacles, and "NO" otherwise. If either 'G' or 'T' is missing from the string, it immediately outputs "NO". The function also handles cases where hopping wraps around the string, using modular arithmetic.**
