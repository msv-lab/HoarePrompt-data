`g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and the condition regarding the character at index `i` of string `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', and `g` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', and `g` is 2.**
