Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G'. If the character at index `i` is 'G', `g` is set to 2. Otherwise, if the character at index `i` is 'T', then `t` is set to 2.***
