You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided function against the problem description, let's analyze the approach of the function step by step.

The function reads in two integers, `n` (number of cells) and `k` (length of the grasshopper's jump). It then reads a string representing the cells, where:

- 'G' indicates the grasshopper's starting position,
- 'T' indicates the position of the insect,
- '.' indicates empty cells where the grasshopper can jump,
- '#' indicates obstacles where the grasshopper cannot land.

The function attempts to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect using jumps of exactly `k` cells, regardless of what is in between.

### Key Steps in the Function:
1. **Identifying Positions**: It correctly identifies and stores the indices of 'G' (the grasshopper) and 'T' (the insect).
2. **Jump Validity**: It checks if the distance between 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k`.
3. **Path Clearance**: It ensures that all intervening cells (according to the jumps based on `k`) do not contain obstacles ('#').

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
To ensure the correctness, we need to consider various test scenarios, particularly edge cases:

1. **Jump with Inaccessible Obstacles**: If a jump's path includes a '#', the program should return "NO".
2. **Direct Reachability**: If the distance between 'G' and 'T' is exactly `k`, it must confirm if the cell `T` can be reached directly.
3. **Odd vs Even Index Properties**: Relevant to the modulo operation, if 'G' is at an even index and 'T' is at an odd index (or vice versa), they cannot be reached by any valid jumps if the distance is not compatible. 

### Correctness Check:
Let's create a test case where the function may fail:

- **Test Case**: Input `6 2` followed by `G..#..T`.
    - The grasshopper starts at index 0 (`G`).
    - The insect is located at index 5 (`T`).
    - The path: `0(G) -> 1(.) -> 2(.) -> 3(#) -> 4(.) -> 5(T)`
    - The grasshopper can jump to index 2 (from 0), but then it is blocked by index 3 ('#'), and thus cannot jump to 4 or 5.
    
Expected Output should be "NO", since the path is blocked.

However, the function's calculation checks that the absolute difference (5) is a multiple of 2. It will thus incorrectly return "YES", as it does not correctly check for intervening obstacles.

Based on this analysis, we discover that there is indeed an input for which the program does not behave correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False** 

Explanation: The program fails to correctly handle cases where obstacles ('#') block the path of the grasshopper even if the jump distance checks pass. For instance, in the test case `6 2` with `G..#..T`, the program incorrectly identifies a reachable path despite the presence of the obstacle.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and the input string consists of exactly n characters, which include '.' (empty cell), '#' (obstacle), 'G' (grasshopper's starting position), and 'T' (target insect's position), with both 'G' and 'T' appearing exactly once.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    g, t = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is a string of length `n`; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` or -1 if 'G' is not present; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` or -1 if 'T' is not present.
    if (g == -1 or t == -1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t -
    g) // k + 1))) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `s` is a string of length `n`; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`, and `g` is not equal to -1; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`, and `t` is not equal to -1. If the absolute difference `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k` and there are no '#' characters in the positions `s[(g + i * k) % n]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, then "YES" has been printed; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` (which can be -1) and `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` (which can also be -1). If either 'G' or 'T' is not present in `s`, "NO" has been printed. Otherwise, if both characters are present, and the absolute difference `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k` with no '#' characters in the specified positions, then "YES" has been printed; otherwise, "NO" has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines if a grasshopper can reach a target insect based on their positions in a given string. It accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (length of the string) and an integer `k` (the hop distance). The string includes characters representing obstacles, the grasshopper's starting position ('G'), and the target position ('T'). The function outputs "YES" if the grasshopper can reach the target by hopping `k` spaces without encountering obstacles, and "NO" otherwise. If either 'G' or 'T' is missing from the string, it immediately outputs "NO". The function also handles cases where hopping wraps around the string, using modular arithmetic.
