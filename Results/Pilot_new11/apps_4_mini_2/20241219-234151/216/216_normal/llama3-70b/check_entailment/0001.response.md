Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as per the description. 

### Issues Identified:
1. The program calculates the number of lowercase letters in the string but fails to ensure these letters are distinct and not interrupted by uppercase letters.
2. It does not account for the condition that uppercase letters must not exist between the positions of lowercase letters that are included in the pretty set.
3. For example, given the input string "aAbcA", the program will count 3 lowercase letters ('a', 'b', 'c') without considering the uppercase 'A's that interrupt the lowercase sequence. According to the problem description, the output should be 2 (positions for 'b' and 'c'), but the program would incorrectly compute this as 3.

### Example Where It Fails:
Input:
```
5
aAbcA
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Actual Output from Program:
```
3
```

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements for every potential input case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
