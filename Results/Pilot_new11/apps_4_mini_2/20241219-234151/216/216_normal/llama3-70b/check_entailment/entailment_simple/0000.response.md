Correctness: **False**

The program does not properly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it only counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string, regardless of whether they respect the constraints of forming a "pretty" set as described:

1. The program should ensure that the positions of the lowercase letters are distinct.
2. The program should check the gaps between the positions of lowercase letters to ensure there are no uppercase letters in between them.

Instead, the provided program simply collects all indices of lowercase letters and counts them, ignoring the presence of uppercase letters that would disqualify certain letters from being part of the "pretty" set. 

For example:
- For an input string like `aaaAaa`, the program would yield a count of 6 because there are 6 lowercase letters. However, there is an uppercase `A`, which means positions of lowercase letters that are split by it cannot be considered as part of the same pretty set.

Hence, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for finding the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters that can be collected without any uppercase letters interrupting them, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect in its current form.
