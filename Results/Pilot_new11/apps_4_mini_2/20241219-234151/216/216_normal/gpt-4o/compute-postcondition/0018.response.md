The variable `current_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_count` depends on whether `char` is a lowercase letter not in `current_set`. If so, `current_count` was 1, otherwise it was 0. Therefore, after the increment, `current_count` becomes either 2 (if `char` was a lowercase letter not in `current_set`) or 1 (if `char` was already in `current_set`). The other variables `n`, `s`, `max_count`, `current_set`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` includes `char`; `current_count` is 2 if `char` is a lowercase letter not in `current_set`, otherwise `current_count` is 1.**
