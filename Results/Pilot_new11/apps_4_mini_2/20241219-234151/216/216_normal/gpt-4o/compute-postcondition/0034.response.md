The `print(max_count)` statement will output the current value of `max_count`. Since `max_count` is defined as `max(max_count, current_count)`, it ensures that `max_count` holds the highest value encountered, compared to `current_count`, which is currently at 0. The `current_set` remains empty, and `current_count` is 0, signifying no elements being counted at this moment.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `current_set` is empty, and `current_count` is 0.

Output State: **`max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0.**
