The code sets `current_count` to 0. The previous value of `current_count` was determined by whether the second character in `s` was a lowercase letter not in `current_set`, which could make `current_count` either 1 or 0. After running the code, `current_count` is explicitly set to 0, and thus, the state of `current_count` is now updated to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is either 0 or 1 depending on `current_count`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the second character in `s`.**
