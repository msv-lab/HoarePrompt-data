Given the initial state, when `s` is assigned the value from `input`, it will now contain the string inputted by the user. However, the length of this string must still satisfy the condition that its length equals `n`. Therefore, while `n` remains unchanged, `s` takes a new value based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`, based on user input.**
