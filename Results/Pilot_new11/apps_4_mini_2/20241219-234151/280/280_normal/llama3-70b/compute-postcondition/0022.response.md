Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` are unchanged; `max_speed` is the final value after the loop; `min_speed` is the final value after the loop; `max_length` is the total increment of `max_speed` over `t-1` iterations; `min_length` is equal to the total increment of `min_speed` over `t-1` iterations; and the value of `max_length` has been printed as output.**
