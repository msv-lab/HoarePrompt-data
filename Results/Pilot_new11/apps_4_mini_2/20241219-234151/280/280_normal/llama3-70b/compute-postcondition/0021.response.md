To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we must analyze the loop execution involving the variables `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `min_length` as they evolve with each iteration.

The loop executes `t-1` times, as it iterates from `t-1` down to `1`. The changes to `max_speed` and `min_speed` are determined by their respective changes in each iteration based on the value of `d`.

1. **max_speed** will reduce by `d` each iteration but will be capped at `min_speed`.
2. **min_speed** increases by `d` each iteration but cannot exceed `max_speed`.
3. **max_length** accumulates the value of `max_speed` over all iterations, effectively the sum of the series of `max_speed` values.
4. **min_length** accumulates the value of `min_speed` similarly.

Upon full execution of the loop (`t-1` iterations):

- After executing `t-1` times, `i` will be `0` (as the loop ends when `i < 1`).
- The exact values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` depend on how many iterations there are and the initial values of `v1`, `v2`, and `d`. However, typically:
  - In the last iteration (`i=1`), `max_speed` may reach or stabilize close to `min_speed`, if `d` is large enough or if both speeds decrease or increase to balance out.
  
- `max_length` increases by the total sum of `max_speed` values over all `t-1` iterations and reflects the total increase from the last iteration.
- `min_length` follows similarly but tracks `min_speed`.

Considering all this information, the final output state should summarize the computed outcomes after all iterations, assuming `t` is a positive integer within the specified range (2 to 100) and that conditions for `d` are respected throughout:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is a non-negative integer where 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` are unchanged; `max_speed` is the final value after the loop; `min_speed` is the final value after the loop; `max_length` is equal to the total increment of `max_speed` over `t-1` iterations; `min_length` is equal to the total increment of `min_speed` over `t-1` iterations.**
