To analyze the given code snippet and determine the output state, we consider the provided initial state and how the statement affects the variables.

Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 4
- `d` is between 0 and 10
- `v1` remains unchanged
- `v2` remains unchanged
- `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`
- `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t + 2 * max_speed`
- `min_length` is equal to `(min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`
- `i` is `t - 3`

The code executes:
```
max_length += max_speed
```
This statement adds `max_speed` to the current value of `max_length`. 

Now we evaluate how `max_length` was initially computed:
- `max_length = max_speed * t + 2 * max_speed` can also be conveyed as `max_length = 3 * max_speed + max_speed * t`.
- After executing the line of code, `max_length` will be:
  - Updated to `max_length + max_speed`, which equals `3 * max_speed + max_speed * t + max_speed`.

Thus, after the execution, we focus on the modifications:
- `max_length` will change, while all other variables remain unaffected.

Output State:
- `t` must be at least 4
- `d` is between 0 and 10
- `v1` remains unchanged
- `v2` remains unchanged
- `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`
- `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`
- `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`
- `min_length` is equal to `(min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`
- `i` is `t - 3`

Output State: **`t` must be at least 4, `d` is between 0 and 10, `v1` remains unchanged, `v2` remains unchanged, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to `(min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`, `i` is `t - 3`**
