The variable `min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed * t`. The value of `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, and `t` is an input integer satisfying the condition 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. Therefore, `min_length` is calculated as `min_speed * t`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new input integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is the new input integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is the maximum value of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum value of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`.**
