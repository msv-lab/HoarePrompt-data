To determine the output state after executing the code, we first analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the variables defined in the initial state.

1. `min_length` is updated with the addition of `min_speed`. The existing value of `min_length` is equal to `(min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`.
2. Therefore, the new value of `min_length` will be:
   ```
   min_length = (min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed) + min_speed
              = min_speed * (t + 1) + 2 * min_speed
              = min_speed * (t + 1 + 2)
              = min_speed * (t + 3)
   ```
   after simplification.

From the initial state, we have:
- `min_length` is initially set to `(min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged except for `min_length`.

Now, we construct the output state by retaining all valid information from the initial state and specifying the new value of `min_length`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 4, `d` is between 0 and 10, `v1` remains unchanged, `v2` remains unchanged, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * (t + 3)`, `i` is `t - 3`**.
