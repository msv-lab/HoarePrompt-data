The line of code `max_length += max_speed` updates the value of `max_length`. Since `max_length` is initially calculated as `max_speed * t`, the new value of `max_length` will be `max_length + max_speed`, which is equal to `(max_speed * t) + max_speed`. 

The output state will reflect the new value of the variable `max_length`, while keeping the conditions for the other variables intact.

Output State: **`t` is within 2 to 100; `d` is between 0 and 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`; `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed);` `max_length` is equal to `(max_speed * t) + max_speed;` `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`; `i` is `t - 1`.**
