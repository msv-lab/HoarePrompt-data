You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements in detail.

The problem requires us to calculate the maximum possible length of a path that a car can cover given the initial speed `v1`, the final speed `v2`, the time `t`, and the maximum speed change `d` allowed per second. The speed can change by at most `d` meters per second between each second, and we need to ensure that the speed sequence starts at `v1`, ends at `v2`, and adheres to the speed change constraints.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. The program reads the inputs: initial speed `v1`, final speed `v2`, time duration `t`, and maximum speed change `d`.
2. An array `speeds` of size `t` is initialized to hold the speeds for each second.
3. The first element of the `speeds` array is set to `v1`, and the last element is set to `v2`.
4. A loop populates the `speeds` array such that each subsequent speed can increase by `d` from the last speed, but not exceed the maximum speed that can be achieved based on remaining time.
5. Finally, the program sums up the speeds in the `speeds` array to get the total distance covered and prints it.

### Problematic Case:
The main concern with the loop that populates the `speeds` array is how it calculates the intermediate speeds. 

Specifically, the logic `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` may run into issues where:
- It doesn't always consider the case where you may need to have sufficiently high speeds in earlier seconds to still reach `v2` in the last second.

### Example of Potential Failure:
For example, consider the following input where `v1` is relatively low, `v2` is significantly higher, but `d` is also low:

```
Input:
3 20
10 2
```

Expected logic would allow significant speed increases throughout the time period. However, due to the constraint in the loop, the following speeds might be incorrectly calculated:

- At `t=1`, speed is `3`.
- At `t=2`, speed could be `min(3+2, 20 + (10-2-1)*2)`, resulting in `5`, which continues limiting speeds for subsequent seconds.

Ultimately, the `speeds` calculation may not reach the required final speed of `20`, rendering the distance covered incorrect.

Given that the program may fail specifically in cases where the constraints are tighter than the `d` allows for gradual increases across all time intervals while reaching `v2` can be demonstrated by the above case:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100; t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is the number of elements in `speeds` (which is at least 2), `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is equal to `v_1`, `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-2]` are calculated values based on previous speeds and the formula used in the loop, `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v_2`.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
