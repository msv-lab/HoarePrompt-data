The `speeds` variable is assigned a list of size `t`, initialized with zeros. The previous conditions state that `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. No other variables are affected by this code. The `speeds` list now contains `t` elements, all set to 0.

Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements all initialized to 0.**
