According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop iterates from 1 to `t-1`. In the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, the condition dictates that `t` must be greater than 3 because it must allow for `i` to reach 2 while still allowing one more iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `t` is at least 2, for the loop to run again, `t` must be at least 4, allowing `i` to iterate up to 3.

State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` equal to `v_1`, `speeds[1]` equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` is equal to `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `speeds[-1]` equal to `v_2`, `i` is 3**
