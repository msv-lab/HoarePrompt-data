The values of `v_1` and `v_2` are assigned based on the output of `input()`, where the user provides two integers separated by a space. Since `v_1` and `v_2` are defined as integers with constraints 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, they will now be assigned specific values based on user input. The state of other variables `t` and `d` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State will include the new values of `v_1` and `v_2`, which can be any integers within the specified range.

Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.**
