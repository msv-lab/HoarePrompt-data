The value of `total_distance` is assigned the sum of the elements in the `speeds` list. The elements in `speeds` are already defined as follows: `speeds[0]` is equal to `v_1`, `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v_2`, and the elements from `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-2]` are calculated based on previous speeds. Therefore, `total_distance` will be the summation of all values in `speeds`, which includes `v_1`, the calculated values, and `v_2`.

Since `total_distance` is the only variable that is directly impacted by the code, its value will be equal to the individual contributions from `v_1`, the calculated intermediate `speeds` values, and `v_2`.

Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is the number of elements in `speeds` (which is at least 2), `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` is equal to `v_1`, `speeds[1]` to `speeds[t-2]` are calculated values based on previous speeds, `speeds[-1]` is equal to `v_2`, `total_distance` is equal to the sum of the elements in `speeds`.**
