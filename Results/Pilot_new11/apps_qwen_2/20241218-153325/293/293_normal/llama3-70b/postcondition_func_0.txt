The function `func()` accepts two parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\). It processes `n` by repeatedly dividing it by 2 and adding either \(n//2 - 1\) or \(n//2\) to `ans` based on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively. After the loop, it prints the value of `ans`. The final state of the program is that `h` remains unchanged, `n` is reduced to 1, and `ans` contains the sum of the values added during each iteration based on the parity of `n`.
