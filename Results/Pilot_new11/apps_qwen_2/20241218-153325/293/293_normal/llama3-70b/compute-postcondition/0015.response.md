`ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to its current value. Given that `n` is 2, `n // 2 - 1` equals `2 // 2 - 1`, which is `0`. Therefore, `ans` increases by 0. The values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is 2, `ans` is updated based on the previous parity of `n` and `ans` remains the same**
