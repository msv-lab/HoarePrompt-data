The code `print(visited_count)` prints the value of `visited_count`, which is `h`. Since printing does not assign a new value to `visited_count`, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`total_leaves`, `path`, `current_level`, `current_node`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is `h`, `path` is the empty string, `current_level` is `h-1`, `current_node` is `2**
