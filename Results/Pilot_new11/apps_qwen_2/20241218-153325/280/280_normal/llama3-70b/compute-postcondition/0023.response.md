The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. The constraints are as follows: `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that \(1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100\), `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), and `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\).

The output has two cases:
- Case_1: `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that \(1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100\), `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), and `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\). If `d` is 0, the function returns `v_1 + v_2`.
- Case_2: `v_1` and `v_2` are integers such that \(1 \leq v_1, v_2 \leq 100\), `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), and `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\). If `d` is not 0, the function returns `t * (v_1 + v_2)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`, and return `v_1 + v_2` if `d` is 0, otherwise return `t * (v_1 + v_2)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. If `d` is 0, it returns `v_1 + v_2`. If `d` is not 0, it returns `t * (v_1 + v_2)`**.
