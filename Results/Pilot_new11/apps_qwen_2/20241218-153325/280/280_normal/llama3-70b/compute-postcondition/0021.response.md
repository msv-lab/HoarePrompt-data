Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\); `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\); `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\); `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\); `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` reduced by \(d\) for each iteration until it equals `min_speed`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` increased by `d` until it equals `max_speed`; `max_length` is the sum of all `max_speed` values from each iteration; `min_length` is the sum of all `min_speed` values from each iteration; `i` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:**
  - `max_speed` starts as the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.
  - `min_speed` starts as the minimum of `v1` and `v2`.
  - `max_length` starts as `max(v1, v2) * t`.
  - `min_length` starts as `min_speed * t`.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop runs `t - 1` times.
  - In each iteration:
    - `max_speed` is updated to be the maximum of itself minus `d` and `min_speed`.
    - `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of itself plus `d` and `max_speed`.
    - `max_length` is incremented by the current `max_speed`.
    - `min_length` is incremented by the current `min_speed`.
  - After the loop completes, `i` becomes 0.

- **Final Values:**
  - `max_speed` will eventually equal `min_speed` after \(t - 1\) iterations.
  - `min_speed` will also equal `max_speed` after \(t - 1\) iterations.
  - `max_length` is the sum of all `max_speed` values from each iteration.
  - `min_length` is the sum of all `min_speed` values from each iteration.
  - `i` is 0 since the loop has completed its iterations.

### Special Case: Loop Does Not Execute (if \(t = 2\)):
- If \(t = 2\), the loop runs only once.
- The final values will be:
  - `max_speed` will be the maximum of `v1` and `v2` minus `d` if it is greater than `min_speed`, otherwise it will be `min_speed`.
  - `min_speed` will be the minimum of `v1` and `v2` plus `d` if it is less than `max_speed`, otherwise it will be `max_speed`.
  - `max_length` will be the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed`.
  - `min_length` will be the original value of `min_length` plus `min_speed`.
  - `i` will be 0.

This completes the detailed analysis and the final output state.
