The initial state includes `min_speed` being `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` being the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed` being \(\max(\text{max\_speed} - d, \text{min\_speed})\), `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` retaining their initial values, with `min_length` being `max_length + min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, and `i` being 2.

The code `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)` impacts the value of `min_speed` by updating it to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

Let's denote the initial value of `min_speed` as \(M\). So initially, \(min\_speed = M = \min(M + d, \text{max\_speed})\).

After the code is executed, the new value of `min_speed` is the minimum of \(M + d\) and `max_speed`.

So, the updated `min_speed` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{new\_min\_speed} = \min(M + d, \text{max\_speed}) \]

Since `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed`, and this value does not get modified by the given code, it retains its initial value.

Similarly, the values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial values.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`min_speed` is \(\min(M + d, \text{max\_speed})\), `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed` is \(\max(\text{max\_speed} - d, M)\), `max_length`, `min_length` is `max_length + \min(M + d, \text{max\_speed})`, and `i` is 2.**
