The code `t, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by space, and assigns them to `t` and `d`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged since no operations are performed on them in this code snippet. The `input()` function waits for user input, which we denote as `a` and `b` separated by a space. After the assignment, `t` is set to `a` and `d` is set to `b`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100; `v2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `t` is equal to `a`; `d` is equal to `b`**
