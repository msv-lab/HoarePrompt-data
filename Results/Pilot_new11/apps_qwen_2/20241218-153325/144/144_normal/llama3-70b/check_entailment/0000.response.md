Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of the mex. The logic in the program fails to handle cases where the array elements can be decreased to values that could potentially increase the mex. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 2 2 2
```
The program would output `3`, but the correct output should be `4`. This is because Alyona can decrease each element to 1, resulting in the array [1, 1, 1, 1], which has a mex of 2. However, she can also decrease the array to [1, 1, 1, 2], which results in a mex of 3. By decreasing further, she can achieve an array like [1, 1, 2, 2], which results in a mex of 3. The maximum possible mex in this case is 4, which the program fails to calculate.
