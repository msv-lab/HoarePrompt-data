Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the input values are outside the specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000). While the hints suggest that the code processes the input without explicit checks for these constraints, the problem description explicitly states that the input values should be within these ranges. If the input values are outside these ranges, the results may not be meaningful, and the program does not account for this scenario. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
