The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. It calculates the maximum volume of a subset of cakes that can be selected such that no selected cake has both a radius and height greater than or equal to another previously selected cake. The function sorts the cakes by their volumes in descending order and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum volume. The final output is the maximum volume of the selected subset of cakes.
