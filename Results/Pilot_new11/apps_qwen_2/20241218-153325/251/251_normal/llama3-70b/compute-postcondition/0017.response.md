State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for j in range(i):` will start iterating over `j` from 0 up to (but not including) `i`.
2. Given that `i` is 1, the loop will only iterate once when `j` is 0.
3. Since the loop will definitely execute at least once when `i` is 1, there's no need to adjust the state further regarding `i`.
4. The variable `j` will start as 0 and increment within the loop.
5. No other variables or states are directly involved in determining if the loop can execute.

Therefore, the initial state must include `j` being set to 0 to reflect the starting condition of the loop.
