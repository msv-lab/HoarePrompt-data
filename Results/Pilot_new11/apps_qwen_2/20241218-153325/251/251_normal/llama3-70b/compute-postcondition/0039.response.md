Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`, `dp[2]` is the maximum value of `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]` or `dp[2] + cakes[2][0]`, `dp[3]` is the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[3] + cakes[3][0]`, and `j` is 3. If the condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` is true, then `dp[3]` is updated to the current value of `dp[3]`. Otherwise, `dp[3]` remains unchanged.***
