The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Given the initial state:

- `visited[0]` is True
- `cycle` is `[0, p[0] - 1]`
- `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`
- `visited[x]` is True

After executing `cycle.append(x)`, the list `cycle` will have its value updated by appending `x` to it. Therefore, the new value of `cycle` will be `[0, p[0] - 1, x]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is `[0, p[0] - 1, x]`, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `visited[x]` is True**
