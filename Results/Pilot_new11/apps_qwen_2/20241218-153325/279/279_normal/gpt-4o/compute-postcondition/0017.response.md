The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Given the initial state, `x` is set to `p[0] - 1` and `visited[p[0] - 1]` is False. Therefore, the value of `x` is appended to `cycle`.

The output state will be:
- `visited[0]` is True (unchanged)
- `cycle` is now `[0, p[0] - 1]` (since `x` is `p[0] - 1` and it's appended to the existing list `[0]`)
- `x` is `p[0] - 1` (unchanged from its initial value)

Output State: **`visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is `[0, p[0] - 1]`, `x` is `p[0] - 1`**
