The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Since `x` is a value for which `visited[x]` is `True`, it means `x` is a valid index in the `visited` array. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `cycle`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `cycle` is [1, 0, x], `x` must be a value such that `visited[x]` is `True`, `visited[0]` is `True`**
