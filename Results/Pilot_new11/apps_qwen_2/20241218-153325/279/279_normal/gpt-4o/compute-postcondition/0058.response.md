`x` is decremented by 1, taking its new value from `p[x] - 1`. The variable `visited[x]` is `True` and `cycle` contains `x`, but no other changes occur to these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains `x`; `x` is `p[x] - 1`.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains `x`; `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
