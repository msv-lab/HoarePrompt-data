Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `not visited[2]` is False.
   - `cycle` is `[2]`.
   - `x` is `p[2] - 1`.
   - `visited[2]` is True.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as `visited[x]` is False.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `visited[2]` is True, `x` must be such that `visited[x]` is False for the loop to continue. Given that `x = p[2] - 1`, we need to determine the current state of `visited[p[2] - 1]`.

4. **Determining Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` must become False. This means `visited[p[2] - 1]` must be False at the start of the next iteration.
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `visited[p[2] - 1]` to ensure it is False.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `visited[p[2] - 1]` must be False.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `not visited[2]` is False, `cycle` is `[2]`, `x` is `p[2] - 1`, `visited[2]` is True, `visited[p[2] - 1]` must be False**
