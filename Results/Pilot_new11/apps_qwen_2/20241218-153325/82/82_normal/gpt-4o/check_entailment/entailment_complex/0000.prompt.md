You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.

    b = int(data[1])
    print(func_3(a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`; `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of x and y, and y which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function modifies `x` to be the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. The function returns these two values: the GCD of `x` and `y`, and `y` which is 0. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are positive integers.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` or `y` is equal to 1, as the GCD of any number and 1 is 1.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal, as the GCD would be the value of `x` (or `y`).
- The function correctly handles the case where one of the inputs is 0, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the non-zero number itself.
- The function does not handle the case where either `x` or `y` is negative, although the initial conditions specify that both are positive integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer division (//) of the product of x and y by the result of the function func_1(x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the product of `x` and `y`, then divides this product by the result of calling another function `func_1(x, y)`, performing integer division (//). If `func_1(x, y)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. The function returns the resulting integer from the division. If either `x` or `y` is not a positive integer, the behavior is undefined as the function expects them to be positive integers.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\), and \(a \neq b\).
def func_3(a, b):
    if (a == b) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a and b are integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\), and \(a \neq b\)
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if (current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate <
                    min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\). `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\), and is at least 1. `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple (LCM) found during the loop, and `min_k` is the corresponding minimum \(k\) that achieves this LCM. After the loop, `min_lcm` reflects the smallest LCM found, and `min_k` reflects the corresponding \(k\) that achieves this LCM. If the loop does not execute, `min_lcm` remains infinity and `min_k` remains 0.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k, which reflects the corresponding k that achieves the smallest LCM found during the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, both within the range \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and ensures \(a \neq b\). It first checks if `a` equals `b`, returning 0 if true. Otherwise, it calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`. It then iterates through possible values of `k` from 1 to the square root of `diff`, checking each pair of factors of `diff`. For each factor pair, it adjusts `a` and `b` to the nearest multiples of `k` and computes their least common multiple using `func_2`. It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k` that achieves this minimum LCM. Finally, it returns either 0 (if no valid `k` was found) or the `k` that results in the smallest LCM found.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
