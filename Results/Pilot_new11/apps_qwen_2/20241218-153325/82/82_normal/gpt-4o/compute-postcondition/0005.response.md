The code sets `min_k` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, or `min_lcm`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\); `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0**
