The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). The function returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are positive integers between 1 and \(10^9\), and returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.**
