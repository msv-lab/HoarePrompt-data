Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where \(a + k\) or \(b + k\) could be zero, which would result in a division by zero error in the `func_2` function. According to the problem description, \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, and \(k\) is a non-negative integer. However, the code does not account for the scenario where \(a + k\) or \(b + k\) could become zero as \(k\) increases. This is particularly problematic because the least common multiple (LCM) calculation in `func_2` would then involve a division by zero, leading to an incorrect or undefined result.

For example, consider the input \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\). As \(k\) increases, \(a + k\) and \(b + k\) will eventually become zero, which would trigger a division by zero error. The code does not handle this edge case, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
