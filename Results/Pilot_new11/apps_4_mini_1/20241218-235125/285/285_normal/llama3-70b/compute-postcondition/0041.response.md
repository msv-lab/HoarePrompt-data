The code `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES' but does not change any variables or their values. The values of the variables remain the same as they were initialized, and only the output is generated.

Output State: **`n` is at least `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 1234`, and the current value of `n` is equal to `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234; 'YES' has been printed.**
