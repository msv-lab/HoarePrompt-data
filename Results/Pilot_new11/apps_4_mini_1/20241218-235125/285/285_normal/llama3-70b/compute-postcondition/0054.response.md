To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop in relation to the provided initial state and its requirements.

1. The initial state defines `n` as a positive integer that cannot be expressed in the form of `1 * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` for non-negative integers `b` and `c`. 
2. The variable `a` is assigned the value of 2 throughout the loop.
3. The loop iterates over `b`, ranging from `0` up to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`, which means that for every increment in `b`, the loop attempts to compute a possible value of `c` and checks if the equation holds:
   `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n`.
   
Since `n` is configured such that it doesn't meet the form described, the loop is designed to check whether there exists the combination of `b` and `c` that can express `n` in the required format. 

If `n` is never expressible in that format, the loop will ultimately terminate without finding a valid `b` and `c` that satisfy the condition. Therefore, for all iterations of the loop, no value of `b` will yield a valid `c` such that the equation holds true.

In the case that the loop does not execute (for instance, if `n < 2 * 1234567`), the variables would essentially remain as they are initialized, meaning `b` would not change, and `c` would not be defined since it is only assigned a value within the loop.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, we conclude the following:

- If the loop does not execute: `b` remains 0, `c` is undefined.
- If the loop does execute and no solution is found, we have `b` taking its maximum value up to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`, but `c` will not yield a valid computed integer due to `n`'s constraints, and the search concludes without finding a match.

Combining these reflections leads us to:

Output State: **If the loop executed without finding a match, `b` is equal to the maximum value processable within the range `0` to `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456`, and `c` is undefined or would be an integer computed until the loop termination condition is reached. If `n` is less than `2 * 1234567`, `b` remains 0 and `c` is undefined.**
