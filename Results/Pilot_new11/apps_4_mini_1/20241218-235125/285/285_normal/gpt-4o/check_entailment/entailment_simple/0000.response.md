Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n`, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score. It is assumed the input is valid according to the constraints given in the problem description (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

2. **Cost Definitions**: The program defines the costs of the houses, cars, and computers as specified: a house costs 1,234,567 game-coins, a car costs 123,456 game-coins, and a computer costs 1,234 game-coins.

3. **Iterative Checking**: It uses a nested loop to iterate through possible quantities of houses (a) and cars (b). 
    - For each house bought (varied `a` from 0 up to `n // house_cost`), it calculates the remaining coins.
    - Then for the remaining amount after buying `a` houses, it calculates how many cars could be bought (`b` from 0 up to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`).
  
4. **Divisibility Check**: After determining how many houses and cars can be bought, it checks whether the remaining coins are divisible by the cost of a computer using the modulo operator. If it finds any combination of `a` and `b` such that the remaining coins are perfectly divisible by the cost of computers, it returns "YES".

5. **Final Condition**: If no valid combinations are found after exhausting all possibilities, the program returns "NO".

Thus, for any integer `n` that satisfies the range constraint, the program effectively checks all combinations of spending according to the designated coin costs and correctly determines if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins on houses, cars, and computers. 

No edge cases or gaps in logic are present in the program which could lead to incorrect results according to the problem statement. Thus, the program meets the specifications and expectations laid out in the problem description.
