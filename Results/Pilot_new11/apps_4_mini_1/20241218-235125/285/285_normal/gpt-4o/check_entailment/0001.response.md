Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine whether Kolya can spend his initial game-coin score `n` on houses, cars, and computers, which cost 1,234,567, 123,456, and 1,234 game-coins respectively. 

### Explanation:
1. The outer loop iterates through the number of houses (`a`) that could be purchased, starting from 0 up to `n // house_cost`. This ensures that all possible combinations of houses within the budget are considered.

2. For each possible number of houses, the program calculates the remaining coins after accounting for the cost of houses and then enters a second loop to consider the number of cars (`b`) that can be purchased with the remaining coins.

3. After subtracting the cost of the cars from the remaining coins, the program checks if the remaining amount can be evenly divided by the cost of computers. If this is true, then there exists a valid combination of purchases that totals exactly `n`.

4. If a combination is found that meets the requirement, the function returns 'YES'; if all combinations are exhausted without finding one, it returns 'NO'.

### Edge Cases:
- The program effectively handles boundary cases, including the minimum value for `n` (1) and maximum value (1,000,000,000).
- It considers all potential combinations of non-negative integers for the quantities of each item purchased, ensuring the solution accounts for all possible ways to reach `n`.

Since the program is designed to handle all potential cases correctly based on the structured logic of nested loops and modulus checks, it can accurately determine whether the money can be spent as described. Therefore, the answer is **True**; the program is correct as per the problem description.
