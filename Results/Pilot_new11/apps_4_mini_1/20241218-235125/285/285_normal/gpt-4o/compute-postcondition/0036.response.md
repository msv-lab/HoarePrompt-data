The code assigns a new value to `remaining_after_houses`, calculated as `n - a * house_cost`. The previous value of `a` is determined by `a = n // house_cost + 1`, which means it will always be at least 1 as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`. Thus, `remaining_after_houses` will effectively represent the leftover amount after purchasing `a` houses. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`; `b` is equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`; and either `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` or not divisible by `computer_cost`; `a` is `n // house_cost + 1`; `remaining_after_houses` is now updated.**
