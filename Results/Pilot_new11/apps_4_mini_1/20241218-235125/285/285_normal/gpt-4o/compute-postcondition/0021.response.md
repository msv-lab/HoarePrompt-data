According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. The loop will execute as long as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is non-negative, meaning `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Given that `remaining_after_houses` is calculated as `n - house_cost`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost`.

The loop also defines `b` to iterate from 0 up to and including `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, which implies that we assume at least one iteration will occur if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is non-negative.

Since `remaining_after_cars` is defined as `n - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`, we need to ensure that it does not affect the ability to run the loop itself but it might define how many iterations are expected.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost`, and at the first iteration, `b` must start at `0`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 0**
