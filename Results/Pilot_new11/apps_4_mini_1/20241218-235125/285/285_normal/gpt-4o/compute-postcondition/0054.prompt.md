You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost` for the last value of `a` calculated; `remaining_after_cars` is less than `car_cost` for the last value of `b` calculated, indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought, the remaining amount is not sufficient to buy even a single computer. If 'YES' was not returned during execution, it means that for all combinations of `a` (houses) and `b` (cars) checked, the remaining after cars was never divisible by `computer_cost`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount from 'n', the remaining amount was never divisible by 'computer_cost'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on various cost allocation conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for cost allocations have been met.

Case_2: The program returns 'YES' regardless of the specific values of n, car_cost, a, remaining_after_houses, remaining_after_cars, and computer_cost, as 'YES' is explicitly returned.

Case_3: The program returns 'YES'

Case_4: The program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions related to `n`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` which is a multiple of `computer_cost` are satisfied.

Case_5: The program returns 'YES' indicating that n is sufficient to cover house_cost and remaining_after_houses allows for car_cost, while remaining_after_cars is not divisible by computer_cost.

Case_6: The program returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions regarding `n`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` have been satisfied.

Case_7: The program returns 'YES' indicating that the conditions for purchasing the houses, cars, and computers are met

Case_8: The program returns 'YES'

Case_9: The program returns 'YES'

Case_10: The program returns 'NO', indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount from 'n', the remaining amount was never divisible by 'computer_cost'.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
