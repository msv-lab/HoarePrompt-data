The code snippet calculates `remaining_after_cars` as the result of subtracting the total cost of cars (`b * car_cost`) from `remaining_after_houses`. Given that `b` is currently `0`, the calculation simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 0`, which means `remaining_after_cars` will be equal to `remaining_after_houses`. 

All conditions and other preconditions remain the same after the execution of the code. Therefore, the updated state will reflect that `remaining_after_cars` is now equal to `remaining_after_houses`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, which must be greater than or equal to 0; `b` is now 0; `car_cost` must be greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
