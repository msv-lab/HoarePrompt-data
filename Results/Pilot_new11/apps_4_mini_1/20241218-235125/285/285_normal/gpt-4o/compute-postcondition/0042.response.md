According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `b` and the calculation involving `remaining_after_houses`. The loop will execute again if `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `b` will be 1. Furthermore, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be greater than or equal to 1 to allow the loop to continue.

The calculations involved show that `remaining_after_houses` is still required to be greater than or equal to the current `car_cost`, as `car_cost` is indicated to be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, which must be greater than or equal to 0; `b` is now 1; `car_cost` must be greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`; `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
