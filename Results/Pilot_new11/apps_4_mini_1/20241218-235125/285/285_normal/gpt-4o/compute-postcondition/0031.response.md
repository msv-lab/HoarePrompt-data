The code calculates the value of `remaining_after_cars` by subtracting the total cost of cars (which is `b * car_cost`) from `remaining_after_houses`. Since `b` is known to be 2, the total cost for cars can be evaluated as `2 * car_cost`. The initial state indicates that `remaining_after_houses` is at least as much as `car_cost` multiplied by `b`, which ensures that the operation does not yield a negative value for `remaining_after_cars`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `remaining_after_cars` based on the specified calculation, while retaining the constraints of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
