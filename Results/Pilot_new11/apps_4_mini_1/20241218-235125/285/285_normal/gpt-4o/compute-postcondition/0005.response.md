To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we can analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

1. The loop iterates with variable `b` ranging from 0 up to (but not including) `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. 
2. For this loop to be executed, the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must yield a non-negative integer. This means `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0 when divided by `car_cost`.
3. Since `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, and we know that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567, this condition is satisfied.
4. However, `car_cost` must also be a positive integer for the loop to make sense. If `car_cost` were 0 or negative, the expression for `b` would not function properly.

Given this reasoning, we can summarize the necessary conditions:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1234567 (which is already given).
- `a` is currently 0 (the value is not required to change for the loop to execute).
- `remaining_after_houses` (which equals `n`) is also greater than or equal to 1234567 (this is already ensured).
- `car_cost` must be a positive integer to avoid division issues.

Since we don't have information on `car_cost` in the initial state, we will assume it needs to be greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

Now, we summarize the necessary state adjustments:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `car_cost` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`**
