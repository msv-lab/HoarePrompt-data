Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, which is greater than or equal to 0; `b` is 0; `car_cost` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`; the current value of `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` (i.e., `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`).***
