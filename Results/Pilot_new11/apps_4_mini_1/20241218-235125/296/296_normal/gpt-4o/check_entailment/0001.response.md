To determine the correctness of the given program, I will analyze the code and check if it satisfies all the problem requirements, specifically addressing the case when \( n = 2 \) and larger integers up to \( 10^9 \).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Check (Handling edge case \( n = 2 \))**:
   - The program starts by checking if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2. 
   - Since the input constraints state \( 2 \leq n \), the check logically appears to return 'NO' for \( n = 2 \) correctly. 

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The code attempts to find divisors \( b_i \) of \( n \) by iterating from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} \). 
   - For even \( n \) greater than 2, the function collects divisors correctly.

3. **Forming Fractions**:
   - If there are divisors, it creates pairs \( (1, b_i) \) for each valid divisor.
   - It does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). 

### Potential Issue:
The critical flaw is that while the program successfully finds divisors and generates the fractions \( (1/b_i) \), it lacks a formal check or computation to confirm that:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}
\]

This might lead to incorrect configurations. Specifically, let's consider certain values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 4 \):
  - Divisors found: \( 2 \) (only).
  - Generated fraction: \( \frac{1}{2} \).
  - Required sum: \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), which is not equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Conclusion:
The program might return 'YES' mistakenly for some \( n \) values without correctly verifying the equality condition outlined in the problem description. Thus, for the case \( n = 4 \), it would output 'YES', but the fractions would not sum up as required, thereby failing the problem criteria.

Correctness: **False**
