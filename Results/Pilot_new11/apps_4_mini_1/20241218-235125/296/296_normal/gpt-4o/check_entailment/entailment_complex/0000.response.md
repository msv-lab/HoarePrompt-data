Correctness: **False**

The problems with the program relate to its failure to properly execute the requirements of the problem description. Here are key points where the implementation deviates:

1. **Handling of Prime Numbers**: The function returns 'NO' if there are no divisors found (i.e., if `n` is prime). However, for numbers greater than 2 that are not prime, the program will return fractions based on the divisors without ensuring that these fractions actually sum to the target value \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\), which is a requirement of the problem description.

2. **Output of Fractions**: While the implementation gathers all valid divisors into a fraction sequence of the form \(\frac{1}{d}\) where \(d\) is a divisor of \(n\), it does not guarantee that these fractions sum to \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\) as specified. For instance, if \(n\) is 6, the fractions generated would be \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\), which do indeed sum correctly for this specific case, but the method does not generalize to other numbers correctly or ensure all cases sum accurately to the target.

3. **Requirement of the Sum**: The description requires that the sum of the selected fractions must equal \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). The current implementation does not have any checks that verify if the sum of these fractions equals the required value; it merely calculates and outputs fractions from the divisors.

Thus, because the program does not ensure that the sum of the resulting fractions meets the condition specified in the problem description, it cannot be deemed correct overall.
