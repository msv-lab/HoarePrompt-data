Explanation: The code does not correctly determine whether the conditions of the problem description are met for all cases. While the function does collect the divisors of `n` and produces fractions accordingly, it does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). Particularly, if `n` is prime, the function returns `NO`, which according to the problem specification should also be considered a case to analyze further. Furthermore, there is no verification implemented in the function to ensure that the sum of the fractions formed by the divisors actually equals the required target. For example, if \(n = 10\), the function would output YES with fractions \((1, 2), (1, 5)\), but those do not sum to \(1 - \frac{1}{10} = 0.9\). Additionally, the behavior when `n` does not yield sufficient fractions to meet the requirement, as illustrated in the example with `n = 2`, indicates an unresolved issue where the output suggests a valid sequence whereas in truth, none can be formed.

Correctness: **False**.
