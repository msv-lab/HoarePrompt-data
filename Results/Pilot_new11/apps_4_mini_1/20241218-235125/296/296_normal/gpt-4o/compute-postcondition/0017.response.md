The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The value of `i` is defined as `k + 2`, and since `n` is a positive integer such that (k + 1)² <= `n`, we can conclude:

1. Since `i = k + 2`, this means that `i` is at least 3 (because `n` is greater than 2, implying `k` is at least 1).
2. The list `divisors` is modified by appending the current value of `i`.

The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, while `divisors` now includes the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that (k + 1)² <= `n` <= 10^9 and greater than 2; `k` remains as is; `i` is `k + 2`; `divisors` is now updated to include `i`.**
