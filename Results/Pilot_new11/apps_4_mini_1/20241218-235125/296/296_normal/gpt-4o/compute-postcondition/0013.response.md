To analyze the code and its impact, we start with the Initial State where `n` is a positive integer satisfying the given conditions, `i` is `k + 1`, and `divisors` contains `i`. 

The provided code appends `n // i` to the list `divisors`.

1. The value of `i` is directly derived from `k`, so we can replace it in the expression. Since `i = k + 1`, we can represent `n // i` as `n // (k + 1)`.
2. The operation `n // i` computes the floor division of `n` by `i`. Given the constraints on `n`, which are between `(k + 1)²` and `10^9`, `n // i` will yield a positive integer as `i` is at least `2`.
3. The list `divisors` will not only include the previously existing elements but also a new element, which is `n // i`.

After performing these calculations, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that (k + 1)² <= `n` <= 10^9 and greater than 2; `i` is `k + 1`; `divisors` now includes `i` and `n // (k + 1)`.**
