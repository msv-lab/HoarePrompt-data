The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as the print operation does not modify its value. Therefore, the output state will retain the information about `n` while indicating that 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and the current value of `n` is 2; 'NO' has been printed.**
