The `print('1', n)` statement outputs the string `'1'` followed by the value of `n`. The variable `n` is not altered by this code; it retains its original positive integer value, which satisfies the specified range of 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and is not equal to 2. The output now includes the printed statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2; 'YES' has been printed; the value 2 has been printed; output is '1' followed by the current value of `n`.**
