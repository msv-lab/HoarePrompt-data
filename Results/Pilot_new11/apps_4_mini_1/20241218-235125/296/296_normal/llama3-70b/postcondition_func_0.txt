The function reads a positive integer `n` from input within the range 2 to 10^9. If `n` equals 2, it prints 'NO'. For all other values of `n`, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and then outputs the string '1' along with the integer `n // 2`, and then again outputs '1' followed by the integer `n`. Note that there is no return value from the function and it does not accept any parameters. The function handles the edge case of `n` being exactly 2 distinctly from any other value of `n`. However, there are no checks or handling for values outside the specified range, which is stated to be between 2 and 10^9, should it not be guaranteed by the context of use.
