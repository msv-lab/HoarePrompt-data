You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements from the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Wrong Handling for n > 2**: The program outputs "YES" with `k = 2`, and the fractions `1/n // 2` and `1/n`. However, these fractions are not guaranteed to be valid based on the conditions:
   - The first fraction specified as `1, n // 2` does not satisfy the condition that `n // 2` divides `n`. For even values of `n`, this is true, but for odd values, it is not. 
   - The second fraction `1, n` does not satisfy `1 < b_i < n` as `b_i` equals `n`.

2. **Specific Example Failure**:
   - For `n = 3`, the program would output:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 1
     1 3
     ```
     The first fraction is invalid since `1` does not meet the condition `1 < b_i < n`. Thus, this output fails for this input.

3. **Generalization Issue**: The logic does not correctly construct fractions that sum to `1 - 1/n`. The code lacks any systematic method of generating valid fractions based on successful divisor criteria.

Given that there's at least one input `n = 3` which produces an incorrect output, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer `n` from input within the range 2 to 10^9. If `n` equals 2, it prints 'NO'. For all other values of `n`, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and then outputs the string '1' along with the integer `n // 2`, and then again outputs '1' followed by the integer `n`. Note that there is no return value from the function and it does not accept any parameters. The function handles the edge case of `n` being exactly 2 distinctly from any other value of `n`. However, there are no checks or handling for values outside the specified range, which is stated to be between 2 and 10^9, should it not be guaranteed by the context of use.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
