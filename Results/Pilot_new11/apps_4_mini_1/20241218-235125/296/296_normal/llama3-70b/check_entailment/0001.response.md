Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements from the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Wrong Handling for n > 2**: The program outputs "YES" with `k = 2`, and the fractions `1/n // 2` and `1/n`. However, these fractions are not guaranteed to be valid based on the conditions:
   - The first fraction specified as `1, n // 2` does not satisfy the condition that `n // 2` divides `n`. For even values of `n`, this is true, but for odd values, it is not. 
   - The second fraction `1, n` does not satisfy `1 < b_i < n` as `b_i` equals `n`.

2. **Specific Example Failure**:
   - For `n = 3`, the program would output:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 1
     1 3
     ```
     The first fraction is invalid since `1` does not meet the condition `1 < b_i < n`. Thus, this output fails for this input.

3. **Generalization Issue**: The logic does not correctly construct fractions that sum to `1 - 1/n`. The code lacks any systematic method of generating valid fractions based on successful divisor criteria.

Given that there's at least one input `n = 3` which produces an incorrect output, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements for all possible inputs.
