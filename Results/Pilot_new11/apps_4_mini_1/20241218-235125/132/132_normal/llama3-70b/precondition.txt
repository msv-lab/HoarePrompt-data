n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 50), x is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in each of the n piles during the first visit (0 <= x[i] <= 1000), and y is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in each of the n piles during the second visit (0 <= y[i] <= 1000).
