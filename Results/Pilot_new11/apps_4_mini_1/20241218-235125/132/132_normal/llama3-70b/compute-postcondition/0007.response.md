The list `y` is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Since `y` is a list of `n` integers based on new user input, the specific values of `y` will change from their previous unsorted order to a sorted order, while still maintaining the same integers. The variable `n`, which is an input integer, remains unchanged. The list `x` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State indicates the sorted state of `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on user input, `y` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on new user input with the sums of `x` and `y` still equal.**
