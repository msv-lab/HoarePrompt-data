The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies `0 <= x_i <= 1000`, and `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `y_i` satisfies `0 <= y_i <= 1000`. The value of `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 50`. The function processes these lists and produces an output based on their values. However, the specific return value is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two lists of integers, `x` and `y`, with specified constraints based on their lengths and values.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, `x` and `y`, where each list contains `n` integers constrained by the specified conditions.**
