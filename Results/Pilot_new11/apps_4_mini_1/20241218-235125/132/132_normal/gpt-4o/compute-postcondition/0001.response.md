The variable `x` is assigned the value of a list created by taking input from the user, where the input is expected to be `n` integers split by spaces. The variable `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, which determines the size of the list `x`. Each element in `x` must be an integer between 0 and 1000, as dictated by the initial conditions.

Thus, after executing the code, `x` will be a list containing `n` integers, the specific values of which will depend on the user's input. The variables `n` and `y` remain unchanged, while the contents of `x` will now be populated from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer y_i satisfies 0 <= y_i <= 1000.**
