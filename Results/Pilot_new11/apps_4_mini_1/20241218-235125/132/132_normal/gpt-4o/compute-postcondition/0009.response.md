Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; and `y` is a new list of `n` integers satisfying `0 <= y_i <= 1000`. If `total_y` (the sum of the integers in list `y`) is greater than `total_x` (the sum of the integers in list `x`), the output is 'No'. Otherwise, the output is 'Yes', indicating that `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`.***
