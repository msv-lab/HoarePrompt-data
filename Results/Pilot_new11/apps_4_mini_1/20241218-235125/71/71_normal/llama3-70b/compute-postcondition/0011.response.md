Output State: **`n` is a multiple of 10 ** k, `w` is the number of trailing digits in the original value of `n` that are not zero, and `n` is reduced to `n // 10^w` where `w` is the count of those trailing digits. If `n` was originally a multiple of 10 ** k, the loop doesn't execute and `w` remains 0.**
