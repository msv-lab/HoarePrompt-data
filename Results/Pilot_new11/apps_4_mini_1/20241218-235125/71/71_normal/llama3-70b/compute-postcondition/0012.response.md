The code snippet provided executes a print statement for the variable `w`. However, since `w` has not been defined or given a specific value in the initial state or any before the print statement, this code will result in an error during execution. No changes are made to other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a multiple of 10, and an error occurs due to `w` being undefined.**
