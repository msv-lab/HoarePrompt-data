The value of `w` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `w` is not specified. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be greater than `0` and `n // 10` must not be a multiple of `10`; `w` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `0` and `n // 10` must not be a multiple of `10`; `w` is increased by 1**
