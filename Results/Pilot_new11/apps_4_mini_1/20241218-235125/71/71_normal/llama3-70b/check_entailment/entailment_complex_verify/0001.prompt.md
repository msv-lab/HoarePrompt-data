You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its behavior in light of the problem description.

The program works as follows:
1. It reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes a counter `w` to count the digits removed.
3. It enters a loop that continues as long as `n` is not divisible by `10^k`. Inside the loop:
   - It increments the counter `w`.
   - It performs an integer division of `n` by `10`.

### Issues with the Program

The program has potential flaws in handling various cases:

1. **Removal of Leading Zeros:** The program does not take into account the requirement that after removing digits, the resulting number should not start with leading zeros unless the result is explicitly `0`. This could lead to situations where the required result is not met.

2. **Only Checks Divisibility at the Very End:** The program continues removing digits without considering what digits are being removed. For instance, if it removes all digits except for one non-zero digit, it may lead to a number with leading zeros for cases where that's not acceptable.

3. **Edge Cases:** It also fails on the edge case where if `n` is `0`, regardless of `k`, it should be that zero is divisible by any power of ten. The code may incorrectly treat `0` in unexpected ways during the loop.

### Test Case

Consider this test case:
- Input: `n = 1050`, `k = 2`
- Expected Output: `1`, after removing one `5`, we can get `100`, which is divisible by `100`.

However, the program would keep doing:
- `1050 % 100` is not `0`, so it would remove `0` to get `105` (w increases).
- Then again `105 % 100` is not divisible so it removes `5`.
- Then it would check `10 % 100` which is still not divisible. 
- Finally, it checks `1`, which incorrectly stops before reaching the final case.

In such a scenario, the logic fails essentially because it doesn't check the order or what digits it should retain to ensure the number structure complies with the requirements.

### Conclusion

Considering the shortcomings identified:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not accurately implement the requirements as detailed in the problem description, and there are scenarios where it does not produce the correct result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a multiple of 10
    print(w)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `k` (a positive integer), from input. It counts how many times `n` can be divided by 10 before it becomes a multiple of `10^k`. This count is stored in the variable `w` and is printed at the end. After the function concludes, `n` will be a multiple of `10^k`, and `w` will indicate how many times the division occurred. If `n` is already a multiple of `10^k`, `w` will be 0. The edge case of `n` being 0 should also be considered, as it is a valid input which would lead to an immediate exit from the loop (thus `w` would also be 0). The function doesn't return a value; it merely prints the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
