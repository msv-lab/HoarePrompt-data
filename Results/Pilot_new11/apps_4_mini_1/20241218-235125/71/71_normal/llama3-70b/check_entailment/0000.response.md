The provided program is meant to determine the minimum number of digits to delete from the number \( n \) so that the resultant number is divisible by \( 10^k \). 

Upon examining the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)
```

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding divisibility by \( 10^k \)**: A number is divisible by \( 10^k \) if it ends with at least \( k \) zeros in its decimal representation. Therefore, the target is to ensure that the resulting number after deletions has \( k \) trailing zeros.

2. **Loop Logic**: The `while` loop continues deleting digits from the end of number \( n \) until \( n \) becomes divisible by \( 10^k \). While this seems correct, the approach taken only caters to the scenario where the trailing zeros are already present (via the modulus operation).

### Edge Cases

- **Insufficient Zeros**: The algorithm does not strategize how to create trailing zeros if the number does not already possess them. For example, if \( n = 123 \) and \( k = 1 \), the expected output should be \( 3 \) (deleting all digits) to yield `0` which is divisible by any \( 10^k \). However, the while loop would terminate immediately since \( 123 \mod 10 \) is \( 3 \), and we have nothing to remove.

- **Leading Zero Issue**: The implementation does not consider cases where deleted digits could lead to a scenario where the result either has an incorrect leading zero or cannot reach the necessary count of trailing zeros.
  
### Conclusion

Since the program fails to account for producing the necessary number of trailing zeros when they are not present in \( n \) by simply deleting from the end, it does not fulfill the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be determined as follows:

Correctness: **False**.
