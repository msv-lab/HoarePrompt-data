Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the program only counts the number of trailing zeros and non-zero digits encountered before reaching the trailing zeros, and prints the number of non-zero digits if there are exactly `k` trailing zeros. However, it does not properly handle cases where:

1. If there are less than `k` trailing zeros in the number `n`, the program just defaults to printing `len(n) - 1`, which does not correspond to the problem requirements. The requirement is to print the minimal number of digits to be removed to achieve exactly `k` trailing zeros.

2. The statement in the else clause (`print(len(n) - 1)`) is misleading, as it does not provide an accurate answer in cases where there are fewer than `k` trailing zeros. It suggests removing all but one of the digits, which could lead to an incorrect count when only a certain number of digits need to be removed to achieve the required trailing zeros.

3. The logic fails to handle the case when after removing the necessary digits the result still does not meet the requirement (e.g., leading zeros issue when forming the resulting number).

Consequently, as it stands, the function does not follow the problem description correctly for all inputs, particularly in how it addresses cases when the number of trailing zeros is not equal to `k`. Hence, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
