You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem requirements, let's analyze the code.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of digits to be deleted from a given integer `n` so that the remaining digits form a number divisible by `10^k`. The resulting number should not have leading zeros, except for the case when the result is exactly `0`.

### Program Logic Breakdown:
1. The program reads input values for `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number as a string and `k` is converted to an integer.
2. It initializes two counters: `count_zeros` to count how many `0`s have been encountered from the end of `n`, and `to_remove` to count how many non-zero digits have been seen and would be removed.
3. The program iterates over the digits of `n` in reverse:
   - If a digit is `0`, it increments the `count_zeros`.
   - If a digit is non-zero, it increments `to_remove`.
   - The loop breaks once `k` zeros have been found.
4. After the loop, it checks whether `count_zeros` equals `k`:
   - If true, it prints the number of digits to remove.
   - Otherwise, it prints `len(n) - 1`, which is an indication that the number cannot satisfy the condition with fewer digits, but this seems to be an oversimplified and potentially incorrect case.

### Potential Issue:
The program does not correctly handle cases where there are not enough zeros at the end of `n` to be divisible by `10^k`. 

For example, consider the case when `n` is `12345` and `k` is `1`. There are no `0`s to make the number divisible by `10^1`. The code will loop through all digits without finding sufficient zeros but still will output `len(n) - 1`, which in this case would be `4`, suggesting that by removing four digits it could somehow create a valid number when it cannot be done.

### Failure Case:
- Example Input: `12345 1`
- Expected Output: `4` (after removing four digits, we can't form a valid number divisible by 10)
- Actual Output: The program will output `4`, which is misleading as it suggests forming a valid number is possible.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly handle the stated requirement under specific cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9).
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `count_zeros` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `n`, `to_remove` is equal to the number of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` trailing zeros, and `k` is a positive integer.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, the value of `to_remove` is printed. Otherwise, if `count_zeros` is not equal to `k`, an invalid operation for a numeric type occurs, as `len(n) - 1` cannot be processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-negative integer `n` (up to 2 billion) and a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 9) from input, and processes `n` to determine the number of digits to remove if `n` has exactly `k` trailing zeros. If exactly `k` trailing zeros are found, it prints the number of non-zero digits encountered before the `k` trailing zeros. If there are not exactly `k` trailing zeros, it prints `len(n) - 1`, which corresponds to one less than the length of the string representation of `n`. However, since `len(n)` represents the number of characters in the string and not a direct numeric computation, it may be misleading to imply that an invalid operation could occur, but ultimately it yields a valid integer output. Thus, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` has fewer than `k` trailing zeros effectively beyond providing a fallback computation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
