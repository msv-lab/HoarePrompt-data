You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to consider the requirements and possible scenarios for the input.

### Problem Recap:
Polycarp wants a number that is divisible by \(10^k\) after removing the least number of digits from \(n\). This means that the final number formed should have at least \(k\) zeros at the end. 

### Given Program Analysis:
1. The program reads the inputs, \(n\) (as a string) and \(k\) (converted to an integer).
2. It initializes counters for zeros and digits to be removed.
3. It iterates over the digits of \(n\) in reverse order.
4. For every zero found, it increments the `count_zeros`. For non-zero digits, it increments `to_remove`.
5. If `count_zeros` reaches \(k\), it breaks the loop and prints `to_remove`. If it does not reach \(k\) by the end of the loop, it prints `len(n) - 1`.

### Potential Issues:
The key issue with the program lies in how it handles cases where a sufficient number of zeros cannot be found:
- If \(n\) does not contain at least \(k\) zeros, the program printed `len(n) - 1`, which suggests removing almost all digits. However, the problem states it guarantees that the answer exists, which can be misleading as it does not explicitly handle scenarios where not enough zeros are present.
- Additionally, if the produced number needs to be zero, the current logic may not correctly handle that case, particularly if \(n\) contains only one non-zero digit followed by zeros.

### Counterexample:
For the input `1020 2`, the program would:
- Find one zero, and it would ultimately have to remove the '1' and the second '2' to end up with `00`, which is fine; however:
- The digit removal counts don't adjust correctly if it runs out of zeros before satisfying the \(k\) condition.

Thus, considering all edge cases, the program may not correctly output results for various configurations of \(n\) and \(k\), particularly when there are not enough zeros. 

Based on this analysis, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), and k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9).
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `count_zeros` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `n`, `to_remove` is equal to the number of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` trailing zeros, and `k` is a positive integer.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, the value of `to_remove` is printed. Otherwise, if `count_zeros` is not equal to `k`, an invalid operation for a numeric type occurs, as `len(n) - 1` cannot be processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-negative integer `n` (up to 2 billion) and a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 9) from input, and processes `n` to determine the number of digits to remove if `n` has exactly `k` trailing zeros. If exactly `k` trailing zeros are found, it prints the number of non-zero digits encountered before the `k` trailing zeros. If there are not exactly `k` trailing zeros, it prints `len(n) - 1`, which corresponds to one less than the length of the string representation of `n`. However, since `len(n)` represents the number of characters in the string and not a direct numeric computation, it may be misleading to imply that an invalid operation could occur, but ultimately it yields a valid integer output. Thus, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` has fewer than `k` trailing zeros effectively beyond providing a fallback computation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
