The variable `count_zeros` is incremented by 1, which indicates that one more zero has been counted in the next digit of `n`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unaffected by this change. Therefore, `count_zeros` will be updated to reflect this increment. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is updated to its previous value plus 1, `to_remove` must be updated based on the next digit of `n`.**
