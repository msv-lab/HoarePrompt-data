Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `k` is a positive integer. If `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the last digit of `n` is '0', then `count_zeros` is set to 1 and `to_remove` remains 0. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is set to 1, indicating that the last digit of `n` is not '0'.***
