The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all previously defined variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
