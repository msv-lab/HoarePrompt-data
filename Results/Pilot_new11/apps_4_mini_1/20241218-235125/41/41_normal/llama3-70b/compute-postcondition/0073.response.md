Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `unrated` is False if there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`; otherwise, `unrated` is True. `i` is the index of the last evaluated element in `ratings_before`, `j` is the index of the last evaluated element in `ratings_before`, and both are within the range of `n`. `rated` is still False, and `maybe` remains True.**
