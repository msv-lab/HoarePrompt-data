According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `i + 1` and continues until `n`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, the starting value of `j` will be `3` (since `i + 1 = 3`). The loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is given to be at least `2`, and specifically it must be greater than `3` for the loop to have a valid range of execution because if `n` is exactly `3`, the loop will not execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following conditions must hold: `n` must be greater than `3` (i.e., `n` â‰¥ 4), `i` remains at `2`, `j` starts at `3`, and `unrated` remains `False`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `unrated` is False**
