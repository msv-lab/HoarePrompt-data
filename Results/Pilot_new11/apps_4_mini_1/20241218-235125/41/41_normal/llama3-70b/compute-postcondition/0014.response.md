`ratings_after` has an element `b` appended to it. Previously, `ratings_after` contained two elements, both being the value of `b`. After the operation, `ratings_after` will contain three elements, with the last element being `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` is [a, a, a]; `ratings_after` is [b, b, b].**
