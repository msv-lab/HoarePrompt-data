Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `unrated` is False if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, indicating the condition is met, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `unrated` remains True.***
