Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `unrated` is False. If the rating before `i` is less than the rating before `j` and the rating after `i` is greater than the rating after `j`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
