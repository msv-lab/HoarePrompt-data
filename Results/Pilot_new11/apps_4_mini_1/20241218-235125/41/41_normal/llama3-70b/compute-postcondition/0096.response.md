Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. If `rated` is True, there is at least one index `i` (where `i` is in the range 0 to `n-1`) such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, and the string 'rated' has been printed, with `unrated` remaining unchanged. If `rated` is False, and `unrated` is true, the string 'unrated' is printed. Otherwise, if `unrated` is false, the function outputs 'maybe', indicating that all elements `ratings_before[i]` are equal to `ratings_after[i]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`.***
