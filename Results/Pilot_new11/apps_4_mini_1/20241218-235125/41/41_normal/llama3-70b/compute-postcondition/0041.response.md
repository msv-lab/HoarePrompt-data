The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `unrated` is False, the value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[j]`, and the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
