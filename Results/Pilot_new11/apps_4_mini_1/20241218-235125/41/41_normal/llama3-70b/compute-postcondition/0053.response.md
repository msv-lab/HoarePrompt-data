The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
