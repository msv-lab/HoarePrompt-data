The code assigns the value `True` to `is_unrated`, but this variable was already set to `True` initially. Therefore, there is no change to its state. The other variables remain unaffected by this line of code. Thus, the output state does not alter the conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, `i` is 2**
