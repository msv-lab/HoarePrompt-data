The variable `is_unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `is_unrated` is unknown, but since it is being explicitly set to `False`, we can conclude that this is now its defined state. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer with a value between 2 and 1000; for each participant `i` (0 <= `i` < `n`), `a[i]` and `b[i]` are integers such that 1 <= `a[i]`, `b[i]` <= 4126; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is False; `is_unrated` is False.**
