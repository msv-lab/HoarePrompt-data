Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers. If `is_rated` is False, then `is_unrated` is set to True if there exists at least one pair of consecutive ratings where the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i`; otherwise, `is_unrated` is False. If `is_rated` is True, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
