The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'rated'. This operation does not modify any of the existing variables, as it only generates output. Therefore, the status of `n`, `ratings`, and `is_rated` remains the same. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers, and `is_rated` is True (printed 'rated').**
