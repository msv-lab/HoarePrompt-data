Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of participants' ratings, followed by `n` pairs of integers where each pair consists of a rating before and after a round. It determines if any participant's rating changed after the round (`is_rated`), and if all ratings remained the same, it checks for at least one case where the ratings before the round are in an increasing order (to set `is_unrated`). The function outputs one of three strings: 'rated' if any participant's rating has changed, 'unrated' if the ratings haven't changed but there is an increasing case, and 'maybe' if the ratings remained the same and there is no increasing case. Overall, the function processes the ratings and provides an appropriate response based on the results.**
