Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `ratings` includes the tuples previously in the list plus the new tuple `(a, b)`, and the current iteration count is 3. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the state of the variables remains unchanged after adding the new rating.***
