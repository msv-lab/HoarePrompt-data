The value of `is_rated` is assigned `True`, changing its state from `False` to `True`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings` now includes the tuple (a, b), and the current value of `a` is not equal to the current value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings` now includes the tuple (a, b), and the current value of `a` is not equal to the current value of `b`.**
