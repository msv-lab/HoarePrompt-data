The value of `is_rated` is assigned `True` but it was already `True`, meaning there is no change in its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same for this variable. The states of the other variables are not affected either. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`, and the current iteration count is 2.**
