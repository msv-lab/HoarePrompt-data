#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. If `b` was initially 0, then the loop does not execute and `a` remains unchanged.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of 'a' and 'b', which remains unchanged as 'b' is 0 and does not affect 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the function, it guarantees that `b` will be 0, and `a` will hold the value of the GCD (or remain unchanged if `b` was initially 0). There are no additional checks or handling for cases where `a` or `b` is negative, but it is assumed from the comments that they are non-negative. The result returned is the GCD of the inputs, accurately reflecting the state post-execution of the function.

def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is equal to the maximum value computed by `func_1(0, i)` for `i` from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
    return res
    #The program returns 'res', which is the maximum value computed by 'func_1(0, i)' for 'i' ranging from 1 to 'n', where 'n' is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^6) and computes a maximum value by iterating through all integers from 1 to `n`, applying the function `func_1` with a cumulative maximum value and the current integer. It returns the maximum result obtained from these computations. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, nor does it define the behavior of `func_1`, which may impact the final results. After execution, the final state of the program includes the returned maximum value generated by evaluating `func_1` across the defined range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and f_max_n is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6; if `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[j]` for `j` in range from 0 to `f_max_n` contains the number of ways to select sums of exactly `j` using integers from `1` to `n`; if `f_max_n` is 0, `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns dp[f_max_n], which contains the number of ways to select sums of exactly f_max_n using integers from 1 to n if f_max_n is greater than or equal to 1. If f_max_n is 0, it returns 1 (the value of dp[0]), indicating one way to form the sum of 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^6), and `f_max_n`, a non-negative integer (with the constraint f_max_n <= n). It calculates and returns the number of ways to select sums of exactly `f_max_n` using integers from 1 to `n`. 

If `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the total number of combinations of choosing numbers that sum to `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is 0, the function returns 1, representing the single way to form the sum of 0 (by selecting no numbers). The function maintains the invariant that the computed number of ways to form sums is stored in the list `dp`, indexed by possible sums from 0 to `f_max_n`.

The functionâ€™s logic ensures that valid inputs result in correctly calculated outputs, and it correctly handles two specific edge cases: when `f_max_n` is 0, returning 1, and when `f_max_n` is 1 or more, returning the calculated number of combinations. No missing functionality is identified that would impact the expected behavior as described in the annotations.
