According to the code, the loop iterates from `f_max_n` down to 1. For the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variables `n` and `i` do not impact whether the loop executes in this context. Since `i` starts at 1 and is not relevant to the loop's execution, we will focus on `f_max_n`.

Since there is no information given about `f_max_n`, we canâ€™t determine if the loop will execute without adjusting this variable. To ensure that the loop starts executing, we need to specify that `f_max_n` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
