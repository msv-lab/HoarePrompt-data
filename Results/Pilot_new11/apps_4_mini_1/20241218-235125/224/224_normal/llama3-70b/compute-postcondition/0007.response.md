According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `f_max_n`. In the for loop, `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements until it reaches 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, indicating that this is the second iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be decremented to 0 (from 1). Therefore, `j` will be updated to 0, and for the loop to execute again, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
