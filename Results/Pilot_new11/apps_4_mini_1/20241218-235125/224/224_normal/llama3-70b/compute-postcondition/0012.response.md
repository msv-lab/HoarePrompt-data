Since the code snippet provided is `dp[j] %= MOD`, it indicates that the value of `dp[j]` will be taken modulo `MOD`. 

The initial state mentions that `dp[j]` is already updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it in the earlier operations. Therefore, `dp[j]` has already changed before this line is executed.

Considering `dp[j]` is the only affected variable and assuming that `MOD` is a positive integer, `dp[j]` is reassigned the current value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `i` is 1; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 1; `dp[0]` is incremented by `dp[-1]`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`; `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
