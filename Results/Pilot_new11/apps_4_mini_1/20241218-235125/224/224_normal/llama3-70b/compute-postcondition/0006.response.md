The statement `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The initial state indicates that `dp[j]` has been updated to its previous value plus `dp[j - 1]`, and it is important to note that `dp[j]` will now be the same value but adjusted to be within the bounds defined by `MOD`. However, since the specific values of `dp[j]`, `MOD`, and `j` are not provided, we consider the operation as simply constraining `dp[j]` within the modulo.

The values of `n`, `i`, and `f_max_n` remain unchanged based on the operation performed, as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dp[j]` is now equal to `(previous value of dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.**
