The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is a specific integer constant. The values of `n` and `f_max_n` remain unchanged because the code only alters the value of `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `MOD`, while `n` and `f_max_n` retain their previous definitions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is a non-negative integer such that f_max_n <= n, `MOD` is 1000000007**
