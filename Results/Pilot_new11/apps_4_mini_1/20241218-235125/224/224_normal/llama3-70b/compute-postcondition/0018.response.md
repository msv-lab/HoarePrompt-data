According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which starts from `f_max_n` and decrements down to `1`. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `j` can take on a new value after the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was equal to `f_max_n`. The loop decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must now be `f_max_n - 1`. 

For the next iteration to follow the conditions set by the loop, `f_max_n` must also be greater than or equal to `1` in order for `j` to remain a valid index. Given that it was indicated that `j` had the value of `f_max_n`, we can conclude that `f_max_n` must also still be greater than or equal to `1`, which was the initial requirement.

Thus, the updated state before the next loop iteration would be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`, followed by `dp[j]` being taken modulo `MOD`.**
