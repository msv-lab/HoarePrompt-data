According to the code, the for loop will execute for `j` starting from `f_max_n` down to 1, meaning `f_max_n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at all. Given that `n` is already set as a positive integer and `i` is initialized to 2, the critical property to check is the value of `f_max_n`. 

If `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute `f_max_n` times, and `dp[j]` is properly defined in the state. However, if `f_max_n` is 0, which is explicitly stated as affecting `dp` as unchanged, the loop will not execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we can be confident in saying that `f_max_n` must be at least 1. When the loop starts, `j` will be set to `f_max_n`, which will drive the iterations. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
