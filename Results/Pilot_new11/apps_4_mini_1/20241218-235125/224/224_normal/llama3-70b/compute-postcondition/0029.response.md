According to the code, the loop will continue to execute while `j` is greater than 0. Given that `j` was initialized to `f_max_n` and decremented in each iteration, it implies that after the current iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1 for the next execution. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n`, which must be greater than or equal to 1, so it can be decremented to `f_max_n - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, `j` needs to be `f_max_n - 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`**
