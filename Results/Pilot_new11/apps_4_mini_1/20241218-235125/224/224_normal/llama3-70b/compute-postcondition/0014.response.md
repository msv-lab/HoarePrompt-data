According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 10^6. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. To continue executing the loop, `i` must still be less than or equal to `n`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, if `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[j]` for `j` in range from 1 to `f_max_n` contains the sums as defined in the loop; if `f_max_n` is 0, `dp` remains unchanged.**
