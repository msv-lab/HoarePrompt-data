The assignment `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]`, which means that `dp[j]` will be set to the remainder of `dp[j]` when divided by `MOD`. Since the values of `dp` and `MOD` are not explicitly given in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific new value for `dp[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State emphasizes that `dp[j]` has been updated but does not provide a concrete numerical result. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `dp[0]` is incremented by `dp[-1]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`.**
