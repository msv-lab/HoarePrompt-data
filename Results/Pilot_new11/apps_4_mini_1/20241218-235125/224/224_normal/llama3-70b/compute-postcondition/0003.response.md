According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is structured to iterate from 1 to `n`, inclusive. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), it will definitely execute since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2. 

At the start of the loop, the iteration variable `i` will start at 1 for the first execution of the loop. Therefore, the values of `n` and `i` are essential states to consider. 

Thus, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:
1. `n` must be a positive integer, specifically between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive (which it already is).
2. `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1**
