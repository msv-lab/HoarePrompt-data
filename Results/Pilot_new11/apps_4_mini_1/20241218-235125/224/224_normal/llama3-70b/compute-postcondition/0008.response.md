The statement `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` indicates that the value at index `j` in the `dp` array is incremented by the value at index `j - 1`. The current state specifies that `j` is `0`, so we need to be careful about the operation since `dp[j - 1]` translates to `dp[-1]`. This cannot be determined with the provided information, as `dp` has not been initialized or defined. However, we can infer a potential update for `dp[0]` if we assume `dp` has been appropriately defined and initialized, allowing for an operation involving `dp[-1]`.

Assuming `dp` is initialized and the array supports negative indexing, if we further assume `dp[-1]` is a defined value, such as 0 or some other constant, then `dp[0]` would be increased by this value. However, an exact outcome cannot be inferred from the information provided.

Since we have no definite initial value for `dp[-1]`, we can't ascertain a specific numeric output for `dp[0]`. 

Thus, we will emphasize the modification of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and `dp[0]` is incremented by `dp[-1]`.**
