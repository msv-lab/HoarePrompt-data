The code snippet updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Since `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 2`, and `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, it follows that `j` is at least 0. This means `dp[j]` can be updated based on a valid index. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`**.
