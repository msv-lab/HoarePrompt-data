The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the function, it guarantees that `b` will be 0, and `a` will hold the value of the GCD (or remain unchanged if `b` was initially 0). There are no additional checks or handling for cases where `a` or `b` is negative, but it is assumed from the comments that they are non-negative. The result returned is the GCD of the inputs, accurately reflecting the state post-execution of the function.
