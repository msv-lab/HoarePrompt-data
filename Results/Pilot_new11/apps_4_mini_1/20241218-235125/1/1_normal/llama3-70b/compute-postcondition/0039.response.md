The values of the variables do not change but the execution encounters a break statement. This means we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, any impact from the loop/if statement context ceases, but the state of the variables themselves remains as they were.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at index `i` of `s` is not ']', the character at index `i` of `s` is ':'; the condition `f` is true; `bind` is `i`, which is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
