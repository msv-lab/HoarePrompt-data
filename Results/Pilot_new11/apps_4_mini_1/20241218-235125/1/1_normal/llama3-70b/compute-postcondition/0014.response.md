Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '[', then `f` is set to True, `ind` remains -1, and `i` remains 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not '[', then `ind` is updated to 0, `f` is True, and `i` remains 0. Additionally, if the character at index `i` is ':', the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `ind`, `f`, and `i` maintain their original values and `s[i]` remains unchanged.***
