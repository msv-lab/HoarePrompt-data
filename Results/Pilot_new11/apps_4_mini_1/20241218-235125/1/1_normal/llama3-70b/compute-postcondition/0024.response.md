The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` has been incremented to `i + 1` and the condition `i < n` holds true, we know the previous value of `i` was within bounds. The length of `s`, denoted by `n`, remains unchanged. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `ind` is equal to the value of `i`.**
