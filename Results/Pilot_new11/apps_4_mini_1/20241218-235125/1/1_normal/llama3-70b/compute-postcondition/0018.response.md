The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `ind` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
