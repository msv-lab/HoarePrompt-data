To determine the next states at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, we start with the current states at the end of the previous iteration. The relevant details from the provided state are:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |.
- `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0.
- The value of `i` is currently positioned within the bounds of the string `s`, specifically it is less than `n`.

Since the loop is structured as `for i in range(n):`, we know `i` will increment with each iteration until it reaches `n`. 

At the end of the current iteration, `i` is still valid as long as it is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will now be `i + 1`. 

1. The state of `s` will remain unchanged.
2. The state of `n` will also remain unchanged.
3. `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.

Consequently, after these adjustments, if the previous value of `i` was `i`, the new state will reflect that to continue the loop execution.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**
