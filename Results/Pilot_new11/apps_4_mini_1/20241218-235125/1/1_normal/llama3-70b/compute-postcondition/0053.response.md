The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as per the initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is `n - 3`; `f` remains unchanged; `bind` is equal to `n - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
