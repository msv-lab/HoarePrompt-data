According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `start_colon`, and `end_colon`. The loop iterates over the range from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon - 1`. Given that the state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `i` is already `start_colon + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `end_colon` is a valid index and not equal to -1, we can be sure that `end_colon` is greater than `start_colon + 1`. Therefore, `i` can be incremented without exceeding `end_colon`.

State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `start_colon + 2`, `start_colon` must be less than `end_colon - 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index not equal to -1; if the character at index `i` of `s` is '|', then `pipe_count` is incremented by 1.**
