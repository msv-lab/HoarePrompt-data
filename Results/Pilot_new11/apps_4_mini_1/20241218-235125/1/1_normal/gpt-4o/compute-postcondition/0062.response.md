The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`, `i` is `bind - 3`, `start_colon` is -1 or a valid index if a colon is present, and `end_colon` is equal to `bind - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
