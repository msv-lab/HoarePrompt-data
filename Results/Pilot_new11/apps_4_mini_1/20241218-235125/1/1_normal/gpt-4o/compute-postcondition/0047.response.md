The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State reflecting the unchanged variables is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3; `i` is `ind + 3; `start_colon` is `ind + 3; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
