Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that you can delete contiguous substrings of the same characters, and the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string. The program, however, counts transitions between different characters, which does not correspond to the operations of deleting contiguous substrings.

For instance, consider the input:
```
6
aaabbb
```
The minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string is 2 (deleting "aaa" and then "bbb"), but the program would output 5 since it counts all transitions (a to b and vice versa), resulting in an incorrect total operation count. 

Thus, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string because it misunderstands the nature of the operations as defined.
