Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the correct logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string as described in the problem statement. 

The key issue is that the code counts the number of transitions between different characters and adds one, but the problem requires counting operations based on contiguous substrings of equal characters. For example, the string "abcddcba" should yield 4 operations because it can be optimally deleted in a specific manner (i.e., by removing "d", then "c", then "b", and finally "a"). However, the implementation incorrectly calculates the result based on the number of transitions, which does not correspond to the actual number of necessary deletions.

Let's consider a simple case that illustrates the problem:
- For the input `s = "aaaaaa"`, the expected output is `1` (since all characters are equal and can be deleted in one operation), but the implemented function would count `1` for this case since there are no transitions.

Since the program does not handle cases correctly for different inputs and fails to match the required output examples, it is concluded that the correctness is indeed false.
