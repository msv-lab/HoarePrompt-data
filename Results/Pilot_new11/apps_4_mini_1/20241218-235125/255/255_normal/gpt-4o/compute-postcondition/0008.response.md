The value of `operations` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown. The other variables' states remain unchanged. The current state remains valid, only reflecting the increase in `operations`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `i` is the next index for the loop which is currently `i + 1`, `operations` is increased by 1**
