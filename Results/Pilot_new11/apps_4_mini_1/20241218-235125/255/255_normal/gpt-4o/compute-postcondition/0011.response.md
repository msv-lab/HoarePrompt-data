The value of `operations` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is not specified, so the precise updated value of `operations` remains unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `i` is currently equal to the previous value plus 1, `operations` has increased by 1.**
