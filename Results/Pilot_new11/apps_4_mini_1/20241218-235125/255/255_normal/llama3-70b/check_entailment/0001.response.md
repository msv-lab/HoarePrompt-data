Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string. The program simply counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string, but this approach does not take into account that contiguous substrings of the same character can be deleted in a single operation.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
aaabb
```
According to the problem description, the string can be reduced to an empty string in 2 operations: first, we can delete the contiguous substring "aaa", and then we can delete the substring "bb". However, the provided program will produce an output of 4, counting each character transition.

The correct approach would involve recognizing contiguous blocks of equal characters and accounting for those as single deletions. Hence, the logic in the program does not satisfy the requirements of the task as outlined in the problem description.
