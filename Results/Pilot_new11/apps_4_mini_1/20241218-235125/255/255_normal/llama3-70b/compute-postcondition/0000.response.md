The variable `n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an input integer from the user and convert it to an integer type. The string `s` remains unchanged; only the value of `n` will be altered. Since `n` was initially constrained by the condition `1 <= n <= 500`, this new value must also respect this condition as it is derived from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
