Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `c` is '?'; if `count[nc]` was greater than 0, it is decremented by 1; `res` is incremented by `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count[nc]` was not greater than 0, there is no change to `count[nc]` or `res`.***
