To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved. The loop iterates over the string 'ACGT', which is a constant string of 4 characters.

The key points to note from the state before the loop starts are:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, and this doesn't directly influence the execution of the loop as the loop uses a fixed string 'ACGT'.
- `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. For the loop to execute, there are no restrictions based solely on `s` because the loop does not depend on its content or length.
- `c` being the second character of the string `s` is valid since `s` has a length of at least 2 (from the condition that the length of `s` is greater than 1).

The loop will execute for each character in 'ACGT' regardless of the state of `s` or `c`. 

Thus, the only relevant state changes for the loop to execute correctly are related to the loop variables and the lack of need for adjustments around `s` or `c`:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in the string `s`**.
