Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `c` is '?'; if `count[nc]` was greater than 0, it is now decremented by 1, resulting in an updated value of `count[nc]`. The program then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count[nc]` was not greater than 0, there are no changes to `count[nc]`.***
