Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in the string `s` which is either '?' or not. If `c` is '?', then `res` contains the first available character from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and the counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' have been decremented according to how many were used. If `c` is not '?', then `res` is updated to include `c`.***
