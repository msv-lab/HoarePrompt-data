The values of the variables do not change because we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `count['C']` is decremented by 1; `res` contains the previous value concatenated with 'C'; `nc` is 'C' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
