The code `res += c` appends the character `c` to the string `res`. There is no information provided about the initial value of `res`, but after this operation, `res` will be equal to its previous value concatenated with `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', the length of `s` is greater than 0, `c` is a character from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and `res` includes character `c` appended to its previous value.**
