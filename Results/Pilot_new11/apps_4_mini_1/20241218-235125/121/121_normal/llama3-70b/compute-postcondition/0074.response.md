The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `nc`, which is 'G'. Therefore, `res` will now be equal to its previous value plus 'G'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G', `count[nc]` is still greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with 'G'.**
