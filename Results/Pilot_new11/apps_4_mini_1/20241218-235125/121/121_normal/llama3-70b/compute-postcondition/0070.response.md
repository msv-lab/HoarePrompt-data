The statement `count[nc] -= 1` decreases the specific index in the `count` array corresponding to the value of `nc` by 1. Since `nc` is known to be greater than 0, the operation successfully decrements `count[nc]`. Other variables `n`, `s`, `c`, and `res` remain unchanged in their properties and constraints after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `c` is the second character in the string `s`, `nc` is greater than 0, `res` is increased by `nc`, and `count[nc]` is decreased by 1.**
