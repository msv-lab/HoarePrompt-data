You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider edge cases.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and a string `s` which contains the nucleotides and possibly '?' characters.

2. **Count Nucleotides**: The program counts occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string `s`.

3. **Calculate Required Nucleotides**: It calculates the required number of each nucleotide as `avg = n // 4`.

4. **Adjust Counts**: The program computes how many additional nucleotides of each type are needed by subtracting the counted values from `avg`.

5. **Construct Result**: It builds the result string by replacing '?' characters with the appropriate nucleotides based on the counts.

6. **Final Check**: If there are still any positive counts left after attempting to replace '?', it prints '===' indicating it's not possible to create a valid string.

**Edge Cases Considered**:

1. If `n` is not divisible by 4, the output should be '===' because it's impossible to balance the nucleotides.

2. If `s` already contains equal numbers of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', the program should return `s` directly.

3. The program currently assumes that if any nucleotide is still needed after processing all '?', it means the string cannot be balanced.

**Potential Missing Logic**:

- The program does not check for cases where there are more than the required number of any nucleotide even before replacing '?'.
- It also doesn't consider cases where '?' cannot suitably balance an already uneven distribution. For example, if `n = 8` with `s = "AAAACCCC"` (already has 4 A's and 4 C's), it should work, but if we have `s = "AA??C???` (even with the question marks, it would still not allow for a balanced distribution).

**Example Case Where The Program Fails**:

- For an input like `6` and `s = "AAAC??"`, the count would be:
  - 'A': 3, 'C': 1, 'G': 0, 'T': 0 → Needs: 1A, 1C, 1G, 1T,
  - `avg` = 6 // 4 = 1, counts become {'A': -2, 'C': 0, 'G': 1, 'T': 1}.
  - The correct output should then be '===', as we cannot satisfy the requirement of 1 each of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' with the available '?'.

Thus, we have identified an edge case where the program does not handle the requirements correctly.

**Conclusion**:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes input consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`. It then calculates the desired average count of each character as `n // 4` and determines how many of each character are still needed to balance the counts. It then replaces each '?' in `s` with the required characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' based on their remaining counts. After processing the string, the function checks if there are any characters left that still need to be placed (indicated by non-zero counts). If there are remaining characters needed, it prints '===', signaling that it's not possible to create a balanced string. If all characters are filled appropriately, it prints the resultant string `res` which consists solely of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The function ensures that the final output is either the balanced string or a specific indication that balancing could not be achieved.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
