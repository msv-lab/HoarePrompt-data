The code snippet `counts[char] += 1` is updating the value associated with the key `char` in the dictionary `counts`. Given that `counts` must have at least one key and that `result[i]` is equal to `char`, we can deduce that `char` is a key in the `counts` dictionary. The operation increments the count of the character `char` by 1.

The previous state of `counts` allows us to assess what the new state will be after this operation. The other variable `result` remains unchanged, but `counts[char]` will be increased by 1.

The Output State reflects the updated value for `counts[char]`, while keeping the other variable states unchanged.

Output State: **`counts` has at least 1 key, and `counts[char]` is increased by 1. `result[i]` is equal to `char`.**
