Output State: **`counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', each having values between 0 and `target_count`, inclusive. `result` is a list containing the characters assigned based on the respective counts, or it may still have '?' in places where counts have reached `target_count`. If `n` is greater than the number of '?' in the original `result`, the number of characters assigned equals the original number of '?' that were replaced before reaching the limit set by `target_count`. If there were no '?' characters in `result` or if counts for all characters reached `target_count`, then `result` remains unchanged.**
