According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute one more time for the third character. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `char` is the second character of `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters. The next character `char` will be the third character of `s`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`**
