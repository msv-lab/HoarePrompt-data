Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'; `i` has been incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[i]` is assigned the value of `char`, and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1; the previous value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and the most internal loop is exited.***
