The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop (or if statement) we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `counts` has at least 1 key; `char` is the next key in `counts`; `result[i]` is assigned the value of `char`; `counts[char]` has increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
