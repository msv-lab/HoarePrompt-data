The code `break` has been executed, which does not change the values of any variables directly but will exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are breaking out from the loop or condition.

Output State: **`counts` has the key `char` incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `result[i]` is equal to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
