According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `char` must progress to the next character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `char` is the first character of `s`.

Since the loop proceeds to the next character, we need to adjust the `char` to be the next character in `s` for the loop to execute again. This means that if `char` was the first character during the last iteration, for the next iteration, it should be the second character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `char` is the second character of `s`**
