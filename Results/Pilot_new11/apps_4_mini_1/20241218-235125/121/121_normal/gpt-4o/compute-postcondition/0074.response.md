Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' having respective counts incremented to a value less than or equal to `target_count`. If `result[i]` is '?', it indicates that `result` is being updated to the last character from `counts` that had a count less than `target_count` based on `i`, which is now equal to the number of characters added to `result`, and `n` is greater than the number of characters with counts less than `target_count`.***
