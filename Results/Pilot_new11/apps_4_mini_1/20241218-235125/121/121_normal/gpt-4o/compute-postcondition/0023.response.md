The code outputs the string '===', but does not modify the values of any variables. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`counts` is a dictionary containing 'A': [0 or more], 'C': [0 or more], 'G': [0 or more], 'T': [0 or more]; `char` is 'A'; the current count of 'A' in `counts` is greater than `target_count`.**
