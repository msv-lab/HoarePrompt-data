Correctness: **False**

The program fails in edge cases where the number of '?' characters is insufficient to balance the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Specifically, if there are not enough '?' characters to make the counts equal to the required target counts, the program will not output '===' but will still attempt to create a valid string, leading to incorrect results. 

For example:
- Input: `8` `A??C??CT` 
- The current counts are: A: 1, C: 1, G: 0, T: 1, and we have 4 '?' available, which can theoretically be used to create a count of 2 for 'G' and 'T' making the final string `AGACGTCT`, a valid output.
- Input: `8` `A??C??G?`
- The current counts are: A: 1, C: 1, G: 1, T: 0, and we have 3 '?' available, which is insufficient to make all four nucleotides equal (we need 2 of each). However, the program will produce `ACGTACGT` as an output which is incorrect since there are only 1 G and 1 T in the input.

Thus, since there are scenarios where the encoding cannot be done correctly, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all input cases.
