You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to partition a sequence of integers into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of the first subset (`B`) and the sum of the second subset (`C`) is maximized. 

### Program Logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))  # Sum of positive numbers
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))  # Sum of negative numbers
    result = B - C                     # B - C
    print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Positive Numbers:** The program correctly sums all positive numbers for `B`.
2. **Negative Numbers:** It sums all negative numbers for `C`. However, since `C` in the formula should effectively be the sum of the absolute values of the negative numbers to correctly reflect the problem's definition of `B - C`, the program implicitly treats `C` as `-|C|`.
3. **Zero Handling:** The zeroth value is not included in either subset, which doesn't affect the maximization because including it in `B` or `C` does not change the difference.
4. **Single Element Edge Case (Negative):** For a single negative element input, such as `-5`, the program incorrectly calculates `B = 0` and `C = -5`, resulting in `0 - (-5) = 5`, which is acceptable as it leads to a maximum difference. However, isolating to non-negative elements means `B` could be `0` and `C` could become negative, which still provides a valid output. 

### Edge Case Example:
- Consider the input: 
  ```
  5
  -1 -2 -3 -4 -5
  ```
  Here, `B` will be `0` and `C` will be `-15`. Hence, the output will be:
  ```
  0 - (-15) = 15
  ```
  This matches the expected maximum value.

- Now consider the input:
  ```
  1
  -100
  ```
  The output should be `0 - (-100) = 100`, which is correct. 

- For inputs with zero, such as:
  ```
  2
  0 -2
  ```
  The output is:
  ```
  0 - (-2) = 2
  ```
  
In every test case, including edge and various combinations of positive, negative, or zero values, the logic holds true to the outputs expected based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing various cases, including edge cases and the overall logic behind it, the program correctly implements the requirement to maximize `B - C` by defining `B` as the sum of positive numbers and deriving `C` naturally by using the negative sums, resulting in a consistent operation across all forms of input. 

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum(x for x in a if x > 0)
    C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
    result = B - C
    print(result)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
