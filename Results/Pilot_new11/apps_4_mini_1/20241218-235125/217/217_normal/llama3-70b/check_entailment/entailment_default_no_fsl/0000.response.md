Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to maximize the difference \( B - C \) by sorting the array in descending order and assigning sums to sequences \( b \) and \( c \) based on even and odd indices. However, this approach can produce incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 -2 4
```
The sorted list would be:
```
[4, 1, -2]
```
According to the code:
- \( b = 4 + (-2) = 4 \) (sum of elements at index 0 and 2)
- \( c = 1 \) (sum of element at index 1)
Thus, it prints:
```
4 - 1 = 3
```

The maximum possible \( B - C \) is actually calculated by taking \( b = \{4, 1\} \) and \( c = \{-2\} \):
Here, \( B = 4 + 1 = 5 \) and \( C = -2 \), which gives \( B - C = 5 - (-2) = 7 \).

Thus, the program fails on this input, producing a result that is not the maximum value of \( B - C \). Therefore, the method used does not guarantee the correct maximum difference for all potential cases.
