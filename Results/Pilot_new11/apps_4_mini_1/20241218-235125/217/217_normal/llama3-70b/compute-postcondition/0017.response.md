Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100. If `i` is even, `b` is updated to `b + a[i]`, `c` remains 0, and `i` is now `i + 1`. If `i` is odd, `b` is updated according to the parity of `i`, `c` is updated by adding `a[i]`, and `i` is now `i + 1`.***
