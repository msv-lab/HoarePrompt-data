The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `x ** y ** z`, which means `a1` will be equal to `x` raised to the power of `y`, and then that result raised to the power of `z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are all positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point, so `a1` will also be a positive real number based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point; `a1` is equal to `x ** y ** z`.**
