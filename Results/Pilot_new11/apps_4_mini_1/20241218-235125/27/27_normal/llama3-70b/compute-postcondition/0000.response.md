The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values from user input, which are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0], with exactly one digit after the decimal point. Each of these variables takes on a distinct value as a result of the input operation, but the specific input values are not known.

Therefore, the previous constraints on `x`, `y`, and `z` remain valid, but their values are now determined by the user input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point, assigned from user input.**
