The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input received through `sys.stdin.read()`. The function `map(float, input().split())` will convert the input values into floats and assign them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the initial state specifies that these variables are positive real numbers in the specified range, we can denote the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` as separate float numbers, let's call them `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively, to reflect the expectations of the input.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c` (where a, b, and c are positive real numbers in the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point)**
