The output of the `print(max_expr)` statement depends on the value assigned to `max_expr`, which denotes the expression corresponding to the maximum value among the given expressions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since `max_expr` has not been changed in the provided code and still holds its previous value defined by the condition `max_value` (which is also the maximum from expressions), the output state will reflect the unchanged value of `max_expr`.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `max_value` is the maximum from expressions, `max_expr` is the corresponding expression for `max_value`, and `max_expr` has been printed.**
