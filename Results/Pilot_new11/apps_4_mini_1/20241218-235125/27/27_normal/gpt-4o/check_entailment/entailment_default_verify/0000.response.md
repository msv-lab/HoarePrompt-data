Based on the analysis of the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment of correctness, and the output hints:

1. **Problem Description**: The task requires the evaluation of a set of mathematical expressions derived from three given real numbers (x, y, z). The program must determine the maximum of these expressions and print a specific format of the expression corresponding to that maximum.

2. **Program Functionality**: The program reads the input correctly, evaluates the twelve required expressions, and uses Python's built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value from the list of tuples storing the calculated value and corresponding expression format. Based on typical behavior of tuples in Python, the `max()` function with tuples will return the first maximum in case of ties, because it compares the first element of the tuples (the calculated value) primarily and the second element (the expression) serves as a tiebreaker.

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment claimed that the programâ€™s logic for determining the output when multiple maximum values are present is flawed. However, the program does utilize the properties of Python tuples in the `max()` function properly, which gives precedence to the first item (value of expression) in determining maximums. This means that if there are identical maximum values, it will always select the first occurring expression in the defined list.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints confirm that the program reads and processes the input correctly, evaluates the expressions properly, and prints the correct expression format. They also reiterate that the program expects valid inputs and does not handle edge cases, but for the purposes of the given task, this is anticipated.

After careful consideration, the original assessment appears incorrect in stating that the approach to breaking ties is not handled. In reality, due to the list structure and how `max()` is utilized, the program will yield the correct output according to the problem requirements.

Thus, the refined assessment based on the problem description, code, output hints, and reasoning leads to the conclusion that the program is indeed functioning correctly for its intended purpose.

Final: **True**
