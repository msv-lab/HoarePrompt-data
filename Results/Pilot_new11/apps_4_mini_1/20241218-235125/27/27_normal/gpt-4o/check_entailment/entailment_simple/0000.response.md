The program provided follows the problem description outlined. Let's break down how the program meets each requirement:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a line of input, which is assumed to contain three space-separated real numbers, each within the range of [0.1, 200.0] and with exactly one digit after the decimal point. The program correctly maps these inputs to floating-point numbers for further calculations.

2. **Expression Calculation**: The program computes the twelve specified expressions:
   - \(x^{y^{z}}\)
   - \(x^{z^{y}}\)
   - \((x^{y})^{z}\)
   - \((x^{z})^{y}\)
   - \(y^{x^{z}}\)
   - \(y^{z^{x}}\)
   - \((y^{x})^{z}\)
   - \((y^{z})^{x}\)
   - \(z^{x^{y}}\)
   - \(z^{y^{x}}\)
   - \((z^{x})^{y}\)
   - \((z^{y})^{x}\)

   Each expression is properly formed as per the problem description. For instance, \((x^{y})^{z}\) is represented as '(x^y)^z' in the corresponding list.

3. **Finding Maximum**: The program correctly identifies the maximum value among these computed expressions and also tracks the corresponding expression string.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value found. The requirement to print the first occurring maximum in case of ties is also inherently handled by using the way Python's `max` function works with tuples, where it checks the list in order.

Since the program meets all specified requirements and handles the input correctly, it behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
