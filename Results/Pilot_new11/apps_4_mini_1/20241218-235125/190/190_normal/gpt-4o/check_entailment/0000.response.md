To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the logic within the program.

The program's goal is to find an integer `t` such that all stick lengths are almost good with respect to `t`, while minimizing the total cost of transforming the lengths of the sticks.

### Key Points:
1. A stick length `a_i` is almost good for some integer `t` if `|a_i - t| <= 1`. This means the acceptable lengths for each stick length `a_i` are in the range `[t-1, t+1]`.
2. The transformation cost from stick length `a_i` to bring it within this range is calculated correctly in the program.
3. The program loops over possible values of `t` from `1` to `100`, which is consistent with the constraints for stick lengths.

### Testing Potential Edge Cases:
Let's examine a few edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly:

- **Edge Case 1:** Single stick with minimum length.
  - Input:
    ```
    1
    1
    ```
  - Expected Output: `1 0` (The stick is already good with no cost)

- **Edge Case 2:** Single stick with maximum length.
  - Input:
    ```
    1
    100
    ```
  - Expected Output could be `99 1` or `100 0` (Suggesting `t = 99`, cost of 1 or `t = 100` with no cost)

- **Edge Case 3:** All sticks already good around `t`.
  - Input:
    ```
    5
    2 2 3 3 2
    ```
  - Expected Output: `2 0` or `3 0` (Both are valid)

- **Edge Case 4:** Varied stick lengths.
  - Input:
    ```
    5
    1 50 99 100 100
    ```
  - The optimal `t` might be `50` or `51`, and the cost will have to account for significant changes.

### Analyzing the Program:

1. The program calculates the cost for all lengths of sticks for each `t` in the valid range.
2. It keeps track of the minimum cost and corresponding `t`.
3. The logic for cost calculation checks both conditions (`length < t - 1` and `length > t + 1`) correctly, ensuring that any stick outside the almost good range contributes to the cost.
4. The expected outputs match the descriptions provided in examples.

### Conclusion:
The program accomplishes the task as described and correctly identifies the minimum transformation cost along with a suitable `t` value for all cases analyzed. After examining several edge cases, I cannot find a specific case where it fails to meet the problem criteria.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
