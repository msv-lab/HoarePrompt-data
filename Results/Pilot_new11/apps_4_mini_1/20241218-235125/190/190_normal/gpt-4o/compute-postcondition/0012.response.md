Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `min_cost` is equal to infinity, `best_t` is -1, and `t` is 1. If `length` (the first element of `a`) is greater than 2, then `current_cost` is updated to its previous value plus `length - 2`, otherwise, `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
