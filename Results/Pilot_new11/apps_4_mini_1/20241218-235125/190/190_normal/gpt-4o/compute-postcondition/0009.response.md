Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `min_cost` is equal to infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0, `length` is the first element of `a` (`a[0]`), and the `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (which is 0).***
