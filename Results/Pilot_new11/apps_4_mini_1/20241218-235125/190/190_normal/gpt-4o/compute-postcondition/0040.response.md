To analyze the execution of the code snippet, we observe the following:

1. `current_cost` will be updated by the expression `current_cost += t - 1 - length`.
2. The variable `length` is equal to the second element of the list `a`, which is `a[1]`.
3. `length` remains unchanged, and variables `min_cost` and `best_t` also remain unchanged since they are not modified by the code.

### Calculations
- `current_cost` will be incremented by `t - 1 - length`, where `length = a[1]`.

### Variables
- `n` remains as a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
- `a` remains a list of `n` positive integers.
- `length` is equal to `a[1]`.
- The values `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `length` is equal to `a[1]`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.**
