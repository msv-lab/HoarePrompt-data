The code assigns the value of `current_cost` to `min_cost`. Given that `current_cost` is less than `min_cost` before this assignment, `min_cost` will now equal `current_cost`, and this new value of `min_cost` will remain the same going forward. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is the sum of costs calculated based on the values in `a` relative to `t`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` remains unchanged.**
