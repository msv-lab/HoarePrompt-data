The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `length - (t + 1)` to its previous value. The exact impact on `current_cost` depends on the current values of `length` and `t`. The initial state indicates no specific values for `current_cost`, `length`, and `t` but does affirm relevant constraints on `n` and `a`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000)
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100)
- `length` is equal to `a[2]` (the third element of the list `a`, assuming it exists, meaning `n` >= 3)
- `t` is a variable whose value is not specified but is presumably an integer.

The new value of `current_cost` is updated as follows:
- `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`, which can be rewritten as `current_cost + (a[2] - (t + 1))`.

Thus, the output state describes the new content of `current_cost`, along with the unchanged precondition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000); `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100); `length` is equal to `a[2]`; `current_cost` has been updated to `current_cost + (a[2] - (t + 1))`.**
