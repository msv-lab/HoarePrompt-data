Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), and `length` is equal to `a[2]`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`.***
