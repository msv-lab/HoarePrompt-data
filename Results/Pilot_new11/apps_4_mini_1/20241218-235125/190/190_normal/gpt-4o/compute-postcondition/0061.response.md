The variable `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `length` is currently greater than 102 and `t` is 101, we find that `length - (t + 1) = length - 102`. Therefore, `current_cost` will increase by a positive value, which is the difference between `length` and 102. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 102`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101, `length` is the first element of `a`, `length` is greater than or equal to 100, and the current value of `length` is greater than 102.**
