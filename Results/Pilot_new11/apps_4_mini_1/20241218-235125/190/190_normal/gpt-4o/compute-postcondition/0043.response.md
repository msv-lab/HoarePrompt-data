Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), and `length` is equal to `a[1]`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. If `length` is between `t - 1` and `t + 1` (inclusive), then `current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
