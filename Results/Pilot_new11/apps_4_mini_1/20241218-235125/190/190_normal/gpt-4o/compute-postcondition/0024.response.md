Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `current_cost` is the total adjustment cost based on the differences between each element in `a` and `t`, which is 1, `min_cost` remains equal to infinity, and `best_t` remains -1.**
