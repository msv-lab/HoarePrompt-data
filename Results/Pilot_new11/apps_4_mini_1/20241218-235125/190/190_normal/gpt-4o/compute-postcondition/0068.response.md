Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, and `length` is the second element of `a`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is incremented by `length - (t + 1)`, while `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged. If `length` is not greater than `t + 1`, then there are no changes to `current_cost`, `min_cost`, or `best_t`.***
