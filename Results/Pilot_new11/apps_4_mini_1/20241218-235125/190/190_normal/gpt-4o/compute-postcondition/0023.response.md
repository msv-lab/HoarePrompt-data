Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000; if `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated based on the expression `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`; if `length` is less than or equal to `t + 1`, then `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
