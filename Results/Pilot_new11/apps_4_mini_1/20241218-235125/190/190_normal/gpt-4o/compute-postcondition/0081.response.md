The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer \(a[i]\) satisfies \(1 \leq a[i] \leq 100\). The function processes these inputs and produces a certain output based on their values. Thus, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a` and perform computations or evaluations based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 1000) and a list of n positive integers a, where each integer in a satisfies (1 <= a[i] <= 100).**
