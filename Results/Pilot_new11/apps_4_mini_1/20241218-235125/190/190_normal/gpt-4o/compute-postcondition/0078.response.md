Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is the cumulative cost based on the relationship of each element in `a` to `t`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost` and `best_t` is equal to `t`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.***
