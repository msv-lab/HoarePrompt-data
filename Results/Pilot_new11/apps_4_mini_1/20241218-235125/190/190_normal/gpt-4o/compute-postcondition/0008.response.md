The code updates the `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length`. Since `length` is less than `t - 1`, this results in a positive addition to `current_cost`. The specific values are `t = 1` and `length < 0`, hence `t - 1 = 0`, making the expression `current_cost += 0 - length`. Thus, `current_cost` increases by a positive amount equal to `-length`, which is a positive integer.

The output state reflects that `current_cost` has increased and retains the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `min_cost` is equal to infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is a positive value equal to the previous `current_cost` + `-length`, `length` is the first element of `a` (`a[0]`), and the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1` which implies `length` is less than 0.**
