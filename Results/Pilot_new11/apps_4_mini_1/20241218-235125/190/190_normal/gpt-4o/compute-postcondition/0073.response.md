Postcondition: ***If `length` is less than `t - 1`, the function does not modify the `current_cost`. Otherwise, if `length` is greater than `t + 1`, the `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`. Here, `n` is a positive integer (2 <= `n` <= 1000) and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers with at least 3 elements, where `length` is the third element of `a`.***
