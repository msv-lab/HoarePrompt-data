The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `t - 1 - length` to it. The value of `length` is taken from the next element in the list `a`, and since `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, we know that `length` is also based on `n`. The changes are only applied to `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `length` is the next element in `a`; `current_cost` is updated based on the expression `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`.**
