To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. Let's go through the logic of the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths `sticks`.
   
2. **Finding the Middle Stick**:
   - It sorts the list of stick lengths and calculates the "middle" value `mid`, which it assumes will be a good candidate for the value of `t`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It calculates the total cost to change all sticks to the length `mid`.
   - It initializes `min_cost` with this value and begins to check for potential values of `t` around `mid`.

4. **Iterating Around `mid`**:
   - The program looks downwards from `mid-1` to `1` to check if changing the stick lengths to these values results in a lower total cost.
   - It then looks upwards from `mid + 1` to `100`.

5. **Updating Minimum Cost and `t`**:
   - It updates the minimum cost and corresponding `t` whenever it finds a lower cost.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `t` and the minimum cost.

### Potential Issues:
The program's approach relies heavily on calculating costs based solely on the median (or middle) of the sorted stick lengths. However, there are nuances regarding the definition of "almost good". A stick length `a_i` is considered "almost good" for some integer `t` if it meets the condition `|a_i - t| <= 1`. 

This implies that:
- If `t` is chosen as `k`, acceptable stick lengths would range from `k - 1` to `k + 1`.
- Therefore, all sticks need to fall into this range to minimize costs.

### Example Cases to Test:
1. **Case with Extremes**:
   - Let's take `n = 3` and `sticks = [1, 100, 100]`. 
   - The optimal `t` is likely to be around the lower end, potentially `t = 1` or `t = 2` (both would allow some sticks at 1 to be adjusted at minimal cost).

2. **Existing Almost Good Sticks**:
   - For `n = 5` and `sticks = [3, 3, 4, 5, 100]`, the program should ideally recognize that `t = 4` would require minimal changes.

### Output:
- In the first case `[1, 100, 100]`, the program may select a value `t` around the middle (which would not be optimal), leading potentially to a high cost not calculated correctly.
- In the second case with `100`, the program may fail to account for excessive outliers effectively since it is not strictly managing the range checks required for "almost good" conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee to work correctly in every case because it does not check costs against the required "almost good" criteria involving ranges but rather simply iterates based on distances from a median point. 

Therefore, based on these considerations:

Correctness: **False**
