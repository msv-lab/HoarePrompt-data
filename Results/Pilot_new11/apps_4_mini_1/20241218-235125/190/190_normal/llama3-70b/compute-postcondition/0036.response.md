According to the code, the loop will execute while `i` is less than or equal to 100. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid + 2`, and since `mid` is less than 100, `i` is currently greater than `mid + 1` but less than or equal to 100 for the loop to execute again. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `mid + 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is mid + 3, and `cost` remains unchanged.**
