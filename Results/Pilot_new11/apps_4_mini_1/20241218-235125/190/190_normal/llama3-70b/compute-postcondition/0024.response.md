Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is at least 1, `i` is 0 or less, `min_cost` is the minimum sum of absolute differences of `sticks` from `t` for all valid values of `i`, and `min_t` is the value of `t` (the final value of `i` for which `min_cost` was updated) where the loop may not have executed if `mid` is equal to 1. If the loop did not execute, `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their initial values based on the original `cost` and `t`.**
