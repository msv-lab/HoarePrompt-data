Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `mid - 2`, and `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences of `sticks` from `i` and `i + 1`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is updated to `mid - 2`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.***
