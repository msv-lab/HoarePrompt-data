According to the code, the loop iterates with the variable `i` starting from `mid - 1` down to `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid - 2`, which means the next value of `i` for the upcoming iteration will be `mid - 1` (since it decreases in each iteration). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `mid` must be at least `3` (since `mid - 1` must be greater than `0`).

State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `mid - 1`, and `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences of `sticks` from `i` and `i + 1`.**
