The variable `cost` is recalculated using the expression `sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)`. The variable `i` is already defined as `mid + 2`. Since `mid` is less than 100, `i` is â‰¤ 100. Therefore, the values of `cost` and `i` change while the other variables remain the same. 

The previous value of `cost` is the original calculation, and now `cost` gets the sum of the minimum distances of each `x` in `sticks` from either `i` or `i - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is mid + 2, and `cost` is updated to sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 2)), abs(x - (mid + 1))) for x in sticks)**
