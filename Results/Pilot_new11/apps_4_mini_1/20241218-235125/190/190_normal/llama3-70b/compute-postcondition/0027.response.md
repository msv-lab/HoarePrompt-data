Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is 0 or less, `min_cost` retains original cost, `min_t` retains original t, and the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
