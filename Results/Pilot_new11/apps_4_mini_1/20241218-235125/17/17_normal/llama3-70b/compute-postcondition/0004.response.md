The code `print(1)` outputs the integer `1` to the console. However, this code does not modify or affect any existing variables in the current state of the program. Therefore, the values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers that have been updated to the integers provided as input. `cnt_3` is less than or equal to `cnt_1`.**
