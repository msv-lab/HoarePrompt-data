`cnt3` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The states of the other variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are not affected except for `cnt_3`, which now holds an input integer. 

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `cnt_4` <= 10^9**
