According to the code, the loop will execute for each `digit` in the `digits` list. To ensure that the loop executes, there needs to be at least one element in the `digits` list. The current state indicates that `result` is 0, but this does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, to adjust the states appropriately:
1. We need to ensure that `digits` is a list that must contain at least one integer.
2. We need to note that `digit` will initially be the first integer in the `digits` list during the first iteration.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must contain at least 1 integer, `base` is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `result` is 0, `digit` is the first integer in the `digits` list**.
