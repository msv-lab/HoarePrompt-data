To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the input and output logic.

1. The problem requires reading a number X in base `b_x` and a number Y in base `b_y`, and then comparing these two numbers.
2. The program correctly reads both numbers and their respective bases.
3. It converts the digits of the numbers from their respective bases into their decimal equivalents using the `func_1` function, which performs the conversion by iterating through the digits.
4. After converting both numbers to their decimal forms, it proceeds to compare them and print the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison.

Now, let's check for potential edge cases where the program could fail:

- The program correctly handles bases from 2 to 40, which aligns with the problem constraints.
- It also ensures that there are no leading zeroes in the number representation which adheres to the problem description.
- The digits are guaranteed to be valid for their respective bases, as mentioned in the constraints (0 ≤ x_i < b_x for X, and 0 ≤ y_i < b_y for Y).

Given that all specified conditions of conversion and comparison are sufficiently addressed, I cannot find any input case that the program fails to handle based on the problem description.

Thus, my evaluation of the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly converts the input, handles different bases appropriately, and compares the two numbers accurately, thus fulfilling the requirements outlined in the problem description.
