The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. The parameter `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number, where each digit is a non-negative integer less than the provided `base`. The parameter `base` is an integer that represents the base of the number, which must be within the range from 2 to 40. After executing the function, it returns `decimal_value`, which is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by the list of integers `digits` in the given `base`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in the given `base`.**
