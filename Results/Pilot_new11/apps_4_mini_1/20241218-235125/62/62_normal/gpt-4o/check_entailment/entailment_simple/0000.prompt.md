You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output
=

Input
3 3
1 0 2
2 5

Output

Input
7 16
15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9
4 8 0 3 1 5 0

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))
decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
if decimal_x < decimal_y:
    print('<')
elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number, base is an integer representing the base of the number where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40 and all digits are non-negative and less than the base.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a list of integers representing digits in a number, `base` is an integer in the range [2, 40], `decimal_value` is equal to the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in the given `base`.
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns decimal_value, which is the decimal equivalent of the number represented by the list of integers 'digits' in the given 'base' within the range [2, 40].

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
