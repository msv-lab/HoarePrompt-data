The program provided correctly fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description. Let's break down the analysis to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers (`n` and `b_x`) which represent the length of number X and its base.
   - It then reads a list of integers representing the digits of number X in base `b_x`. 
   - The process is repeated for number Y, where the program reads two integers (`m` and `b_y`) and a corresponding list of integers for its digits.
   - This matches the input specification provided in the problem description.

2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base, and computes the decimal value of the number represented in that base.
   - It accumulates the decimal value according to the positional value of each digit, which accurately converts the base `b_x` and `b_y` representations to decimal format.
   - The computation correctly adheres to the standard algorithm for base conversion.

3. **Comparison of Values**:
   - After obtaining the decimal values of X and Y (`decimal_x` and `decimal_y`), the program compares the two values.
   - Depending on the result of the comparison, the program outputs `<`, `>`, or `=`. This corresponds exactly to the required output format in the problem description.

4. **Assumptions**: 
   - The program also incorporates the assumption that the input is valid, i.e., it will only receive digits less than their respective bases, as specified in the problem statement. Since we assume that inputs will always be valid, this lack of handling for invalid inputs does not affect the correctness.

In summary, considering all these points, the program does match the specified requirements of the problem description in every aspect. Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
