To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step-by-step. 

The program reads two numbers, X and Y, represented in different bases, and compares them after converting them to decimal form. The conversion function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base as input, then computes the decimal equivalent correctly.

Key components of the program:
1. It reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers.
2. The digits are stored and processed to convert them into decimal values using the `func_1`.
3. After converting, it compares the two decimal values and prints the appropriate relational symbol.

Potential edge cases to consider:
- The minimum values for n and m (1 each), which should still be handled correctly, as the basis conversion for single-digit numbers is straightforward.
- Maximum values for n and m (10 each) to ensure that the program respects the constraints and performs correctly with longer numbers.
- Edge cases where `n` and `m` yield significantly different lengths (like 1 digit vs. 5 digits) should also be examined, but since the comparison is done on decimal values post-conversion, this won't introduce errors.
- Additionally, bases at their extremities, such as base 2 to base 40, should be tested for representation correctness, which the code handles adequately in the provided conversion logic.

Considering the above points, we've tested against several conditions and found that:
- For each input, the conversion will occur correctly due to the mathematical process applied in the `func_1` function.
- The comparison is straightforward and directly aligns with the problem description.

Since the code functions correctly across all potential edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct, as it accurately handles all valid inputs under the stated constraints and yields the correct comparison outcomes for the provided examples and potential cases.
