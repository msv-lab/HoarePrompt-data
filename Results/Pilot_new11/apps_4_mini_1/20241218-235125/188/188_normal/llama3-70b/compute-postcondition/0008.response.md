To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we consider the nature of the loop and the initial conditions set for the variables.

Initial State: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is an empty list. The loop will execute exactly `n` times since `n` is fixed and positive. During each iteration, an integer will be appended to the list `a`.

After all iterations are complete:

- `n` remains the same, an even integer between 2 and 100.
- The variable `i` will take on the value of `n - 1`, because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- The list `a` will contain `n` elements, as each iteration appends an integer input to it.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` contains `n` integers received as inputs.**
