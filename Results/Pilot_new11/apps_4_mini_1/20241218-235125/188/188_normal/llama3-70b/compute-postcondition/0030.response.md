The variable `a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous state of `a1` was -1, and now it will take the value of `i`. The variables `n`, `a`, `d`, `c`, and `a2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must not be empty, `c` is 0, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, and the current value of the element `d[i]` is equal to `n` divided by 2.**
