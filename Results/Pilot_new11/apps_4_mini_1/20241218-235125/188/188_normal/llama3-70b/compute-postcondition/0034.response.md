The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must not be empty, `c` is a positive integer (not equal to 0), `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the current value of the element `d[i]` is equal to `n` divided by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
