The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, but no information is provided about the previous value of `i`. Therefore, `i` remains unspecified. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so we retain their initial conditions. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must not be empty, `c` is a positive integer (not equal to 0), `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, and the current value of the element `d[i]` is equal to `n` divided by 2.**
