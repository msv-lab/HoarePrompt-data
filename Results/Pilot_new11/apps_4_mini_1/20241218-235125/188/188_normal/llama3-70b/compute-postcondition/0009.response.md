The code initializes `d` as an empty dictionary. This does not change the values of `n`, `i`, or `a`, so their states remain as they were. The only affected variable is `d`, which is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` contains `n` integers received as inputs, `d` is an empty dictionary.**
