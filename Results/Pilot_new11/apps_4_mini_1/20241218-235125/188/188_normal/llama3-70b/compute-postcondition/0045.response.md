The variable `a1` is assigned the current value of `i`. The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must have at least `m + 1` elements, `c` is unchanged or updated based on previous values, `a1` is equal to the current value of `i`, `a2` is the previous value of `i`.**
