In the provided code, `a2` is assigned the current value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as their values don't interact directly with `a2`. The variable `i` retains its previous value during this assignment to `a2`. 

Since `a1` holds the previous value of `i` (which is not defined in the current state), `a2` will take the value of `i` directly. Variables `n`, `a`, `d`, and `c` remain as they were, and `c` remains unchanged or is confirmed to be 1 if it was initially 0.

Thus, the output state reflects these evaluations:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is not empty, `c` is either 0 or 1 (if c was 0 it becomes 1), `a1` is the previous value of `i`, `a2` is set to the current value of `i`.**
