The variable `d` at index `i` is assigned the value `1`. Given that `i` is the third integer from list `a`, this means the value of `d[i]` (where `i` is specifically an index derived from a list of integers) is modified but the other variables remain unaffected.

Since `n` is stated as an even integer between 2 and 100, we retain this statement as it is still valid. The list `a` still contains at least three integers, and `i` remains defined as that third integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `a` contains at least 3 integers; `i` is the third integer from list `a`; `d[i]` is assigned the value 1.**
