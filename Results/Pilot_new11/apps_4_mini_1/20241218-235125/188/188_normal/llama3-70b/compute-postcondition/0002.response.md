To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the provided states before the loop starts and the behavior of the for loop. 

1. The variable `n` is guaranteed to be an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). This means `n` is always at least 2, so the loop can execute at least once.
2. The variable `a` is an empty list. Although it doesn't directly impact the execution of the for loop itself, it may be relevant depending on how the list is used within the loop's body (which is omitted here).

Since the loop iterates over a range defined by `n`, we can deduce that the variable `i` will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during the iterations of the loop.

There are no additional adjustments needed for the state of `a` since the loop doesn't require any specific elements in `a` to execute based on the provided context. 

Thus, the states to be declared are based on the values of `n` and `i`.

State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0**
