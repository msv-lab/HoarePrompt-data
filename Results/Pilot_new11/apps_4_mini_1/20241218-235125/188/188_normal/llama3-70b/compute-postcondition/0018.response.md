The code assigns the value `1` to the dictionary `d` at the key corresponding to `i`. The value of `i` is known to be the second integer from the list `a`, which contains `n` integers. Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `i` will take on a value that is one of those integers in `a`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`) remain unchanged as the operation affects only the dictionary `d`. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `a` contains `n` integers; `i` is the second integer from list `a`; `d[i]` is assigned the value 1.**
