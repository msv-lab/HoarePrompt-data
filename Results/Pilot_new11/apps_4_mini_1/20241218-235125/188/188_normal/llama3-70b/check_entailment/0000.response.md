To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description:

1. The problem requires Petya and Vasya to choose distinct integers from the cards such that together they collect all the cards, and each player ends up with an equal number of cards.
2. The number of cards `n` is guaranteed to be even.
3. The output must be "NO" if it's impossible for them to achieve this under the given conditions.

Let's analyze the program:

- The program reads an integer `n`, and then `n` integers (the card values) into a list `a`.
- It uses a dictionary `d` to count occurrences of each card value.
- It tries to find two distinct integers that appear exactly `n / 2` times each, which would mean they can equally split the cards.
- The logic checks if exactly two such integers are found. If found, it prints "YES" along with those integers; otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, there is a flaw in the condition of selecting integers. The program currently checks if any integer appears exactly `n / 2` times, but it does not check if there are two distinct integers across the entire list that can cover all cards. Also, if all numbers on the cards are the same, this logic will not handle it correctly, as it will still go into the loop checking distinct integers and may end up printing "NO" incorrectly.

### Potential failing case:
- If the input is:
  ```
  6
  1
  1
  1
  2
  2
  2
  ```
- In this case, Vasya cannot choose a number to make a fair game because even though "1" appears 3 times and "2" appears 3 times, they can't both pick distinct numbers and end up with even card counts and total `n`. The correct output is "NO", but if the logic does not reflect that accurately, it would fail.

Given this analysis, the implementation has a logical flaw in handling such scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
