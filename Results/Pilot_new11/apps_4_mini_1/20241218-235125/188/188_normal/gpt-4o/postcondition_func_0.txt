The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and reads `n` integers, each within the range of 1 to 100, from standard input. It counts the frequency of each integer and sorts the unique integers by their frequency. If there are fewer than two unique integers, it prints 'NO'. If there are at least two unique integers, it checks if both the most frequent and the second most frequent integers each appear exactly `n//2` times. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. In summary, the function determines if the integers can be evenly divided into two groups of equal size consisting of the two most frequent integers. If the conditions for these groups are not met or unique integers are insufficient, no successful grouping is reported.
