Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequencies of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique integers based on their frequency in ascending order and has a length of 2 or greater. If the count of the most frequent integer and the second most frequent integer in `unique_numbers` are both equal to n // 2, then the output is 'YES' and the printed values are the two most frequent integers in `unique_numbers`. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
