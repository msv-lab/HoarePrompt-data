To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the implementation of the program step-by-step.

### Problem Description

We need to find the minimum number of coins (let's denote it by `x`, where `x` is the number of coins each of Ivan's friends will gift) that satisfies the following conditions:

1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins (`x`).
2. The total coins gifted must be different. Given that there are `M` friends, Ivan receives `M * x` coins.
3. At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.
4. Additionally, consider the edge cases with the limits of the variables (`1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18` and `1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18`).

### Program Logic

The provided function checks two conditions:

- If the number of different coins (`N - K`) available to gift, plus the coins Ivan already has (`K`), is enough to satisfy his friends when `M` (the number of friends) is equal to or less than the available different coins.
- If the number of friends (`M`) is at least equal to the number of new coins required (`L`).

The function returns `1` if both conditions are met. If not, it returns `-1`.

### Example Inputs

Let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Input: `20 15 2 3`**
   - Total coins Ivan can have = `20`
   - Coins in Ivan's collection = `2`
   - Friends = `15`
   - New coins needed = `3`
   - Here, `M (15)` is less than `N - K + 1 (19)` and also `M (15)` is greater than `L (3)`. Therefore, output should be `1`. The output is correct.

2. **Input: `10 11 2 4`**
   - Here, the total coins Ivan can have is `10`.
   - Coins in Ivan's collection = `2`
   - Friends = `11`
   - New coins needed = `4`
   - The total number of different coins (10) is less than the friends (11 `> 10`), and hence not all friends can gift different coins. Thus, it should output `-1`. The output is correct.

### Edge Cases Not Considered

However, there might be edge cases that we're not fully handling:

- Imagine `N = 5, K = 2, M = 3, L = 3`. According to the implemented logic:
  - `N - K = 3`, and even if all friends gift coins, they can at most gift `3` different coins (which would also be all new) so `L` is satisfied, but there aren't enough different coins for all friends to give because `M != M * x` (they cannot gift `x` such that `M * x > 5`). The condition `M >= N - K + 1` will fail, thus it would return `-1` mistakenly while it should have ideally suggested that there's no way to satisfy the condition with `x = 1`.

### Conclusion

The function fails to address some combinations of inputs, especially with smaller values, where `M * x` might exceed `N`. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
