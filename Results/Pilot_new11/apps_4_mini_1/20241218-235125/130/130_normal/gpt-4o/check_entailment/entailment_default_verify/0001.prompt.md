You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description in detail.

The program aims to find the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to Ivan, such that:
1. All coins gifted must be different.
2. At least `L` of the coins must be new (i.e., not already in Ivan's collection).
3. Each of Ivan's `M` friends must give the same number of coins, `x`.

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The input values are:
   - `N`: Total number of different collectible coins.
   - `M`: Number of Ivan's friends.
   - `K`: Number of coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins that should be gifted.

2. The expression `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must give so that when multiplied by the number of friends `M`, the total number of new coins gifted is at least `L`. This uses ceiling division to ensure that if there's a remainder, it rounds up.

3. The conditional statement checks whether the total number of coins gifted (which is `M * min_x`) does not exceed the possible new coins that can be given to Ivan, which is `(N - K)`. This ensures that all the coins given are different and possible within the limits of total collectible coins.

4. If the conditions are satisfied, it prints `min_x`, otherwise it prints `-1`.

### Possible Cases to Consider:

1. **Case when `L` is larger than `M`:**
   If `L > M`, then the minimum `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` will be greater than 1 (because each friend giving at least one coin won’t be enough to satisfy `L`). It seems the program should still work, since if each friend gave `min_x` coins, it's possible some of those might still be duplicates of Ivan's coins.

2. **Case when `K` is very close to `N`:**
   If `K = N - 1`, and `M` is greater than 1, the only way for the friends to gift coins without duplicates would be impossible unless they each gave at least 1 (but it would reach `N` total coins quickly).

3. **Max boundary test:**
   The largest values for all inputs (e.g., `N = 10^18`, `M = 10^18`, `K = 10^18`, `L = 10^18`) should also be handled to check integer overflow conditions. Python can handle large integers, but logic still needs to accurately restrict conditions.

4. **Minimum values:**
   If `N = 1`, `K = 1`, and `M = L = 1`, then it's impossible to gift new coins, so it should return `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to handle different cases well based on the given checks, and the calculations seem valid according to the problem description. However, there are scenarios (like ones outlined above) where the logic could fail to guarantee `L` new coins can be given while satisfying all conditions. Specifically, the case where `K` is very close to `N` can make it impossible for friends to gift the required number of unique coins.

Thus, we conclude the correctness based on potential edge cases:

Correctness: **False**. 
Case present: When `N = 2`, `K = 1`, `M = 2`, and `L = 1`, the output should be `1` but since each friend cannot give a unique coin, it would output `-1`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers (N, M, K, L) from standard input, which represent certain constraints. It calculates a value min_x, which is the minimum number of full M-sized pieces needed to reach or exceed L. If the product of M and min_x is less than or equal to the remaining capacity (N - K), it prints the value of min_x; otherwise, it prints -1. The final output reflects whether it's possible to fit the required pieces within the given constraints. Notably, the function does not return any value; it only prints results directly. Edge cases such as the condition where no pieces can be allocated due to insufficient remaining capacity (N - K) are handled, as the function correctly assesses and prints -1 when applicable.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
