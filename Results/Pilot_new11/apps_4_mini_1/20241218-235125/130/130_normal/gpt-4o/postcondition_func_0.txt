The function reads four integers (N, M, K, L) from standard input, which represent certain constraints. It calculates a value min_x, which is the minimum number of full M-sized pieces needed to reach or exceed L. If the product of M and min_x is less than or equal to the remaining capacity (N - K), it prints the value of min_x; otherwise, it prints -1. The final output reflects whether it's possible to fit the required pieces within the given constraints. Notably, the function does not return any value; it only prints results directly. Edge cases such as the condition where no pieces can be allocated due to insufficient remaining capacity (N - K) are handled, as the function correctly assesses and prints -1 when applicable.
