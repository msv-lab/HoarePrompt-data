To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the problem description, let's break down the logic of the program and confirm that it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Requirements**:
   - Two integers, `n` (number of kegs) and `s` (liters of kvass to be poured).
   - A list of integers representing the volumes of kvass in each keg.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - If it's impossible to pour `s` liters of kvass, the program should return `-1`.
   - If it's possible, it should return the maximum possible kvass level left in the least filled keg after pouring `s` liters.

### Program Logic:
1. **Check Total Volume**:
   - The program starts by calculating the total volume of kvass across all kegs. If this total is less than `s`, it prints `-1`, which is correct as it indicates that it's impossible to pour the desired amount.

2. **Determine Remaining Kvass**:
   - The program sorts the kegs to identify the keg with the least volume (`min_keg_volume`).
   - It then attempts to pour kvass, taking from other kegs until the desired amount `s` is achieved or until it can take no more from the kegs.
   - The logic for determining how much can be taken from each keg above `min_keg_volume` is correct; it ensures that the least filled keg retains as much kvass as possible.

3. **Adjust `min_keg_volume`**:
   - If there is still remaining kvass that needs to be poured after considering the other kegs, it calculates how this remaining needed kvass affects the minimum keg level by adjusting `min_keg_volume` downward proportionately to the number of kegs.

### Critical Points to Evaluate:
- **Handling of Inputs and Valid Outputs**: The program properly checks if the total kvass is sufficient for the pour. If not sufficient, it returns `-1`. If sufficient, it correctly calculates the level in the least keg after pouring.
  
- **Adjustment Logic**: The mathematical operation `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` ensures that any necessary decrease to `min_keg_volume` is distributed evenly across all kegs, preventing any keg from going below this adjusted level unless absolutely required.

- **Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle scenarios where:
   - All kegs have the same volume (it does, as it relies on ordering and conditions).
   - `s` is equal to the total sum of kvass (the least keg must retain its original value).

After evaluating these points, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required for the task described in the problem. It handles both necessary checks and calculations for putting the kvass in the least filled keg correctly after pouring `s` liters.

Correctness: **True**
