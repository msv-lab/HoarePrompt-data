To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze how the program behaves with given input scenarios and edge cases.

### Key Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. The sum of kvass in all kegs must be at least `s`. If not, the output should be `-1`.
2. If enough kvass can be poured, the goal is to maximize the minimum amount of kvass left in the least filled keg after pouring out `s` liters.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Input Reading and Sorting**: 
   - The input values (n and s) and the kegs' volumes are read and sorted. Sorting helps easily find the minimum keg.
  
2. **Checking Total Volume**:
   - It checks if the total volume is less than `s`. If true, the program correctly prints `-1`.

3. **Pouring Logic**:
   - The program then initializes `min_keg_volume` as the first element of the sorted volumes and uses a loop to simulate the pouring of kvass from the kegs.
   - It attempts to equalize the pouring from other kegs to minimize the impact on the least filled keg.
   - If `remaining_kvass` is still greater than 0 after attempting to pour from all other kegs, it computes how much more can be sacrificed equally among kegs to preserve the minimum level in `min_keg_volume`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - Finally, it prints the effective minimum amount of kvass left in the least keg.

### Potential Edge Cases:
We'll examine potential edge cases where the logic could fail. Here are a few important ones:

- **Case 1**: When kegs have exactly the amount needed.
    - Input: `4 4`, `1 1 1 1`
      - Expected Output: `-1` because the total is exactly what we needed.
      - Current Output: The program would incorrectly alter `min_keg_volume` even though it's not possible to take any more kvass.

- **Case 2**: When the smallest keg is significantly smaller than the total volume.
    - Input: `3 6`, `2 2 9`
      - Here, it's possible to pour `6` liters, but would leave the smallest keg at `0`, making the output theoretically `0`.
      - The output would be `0`, which is expected.

Based on these observations, I conclude that the program is **not** handling the first case correctly. 

### Correctness Evaluation:
Since the program fails for at least one test case derived from the potential edge cases provided by the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
