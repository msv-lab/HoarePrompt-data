The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `v`. Parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\). Parameter `s` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\). Parameter `v` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `v[i]` satisfies \(1 \leq v[i] \leq 10^9\). The return value of the function is not explicitly stated in the prompt. Therefore, I will outline the full functionality based on the provided constraints and relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `s`, and a list of `n` integers `v`, and processes these inputs to return an output based on specific criteria, which is not provided in the output section.**
