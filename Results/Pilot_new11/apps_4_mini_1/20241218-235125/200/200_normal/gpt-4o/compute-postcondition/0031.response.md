The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `remaining_kvass` remains equal to 0; `possible_to_take` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
