The variable `volumes` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input string (split into separate entries) to integers. The input values are integers and should be stored in the `volumes` list. The other states of the variables `n`, `s`, and `v` remain the same; however, `v` is now replaced by `volumes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the input value satisfying 1 <= s <= 10^12; `volumes` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `volumes[i]` is equal to an input integer.**
