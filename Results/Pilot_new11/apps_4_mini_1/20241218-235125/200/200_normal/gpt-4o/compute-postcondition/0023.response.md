Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and must be greater than 1; `i` is 1. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop continues to the next iteration if there is one. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum of `volumes[1] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.***
