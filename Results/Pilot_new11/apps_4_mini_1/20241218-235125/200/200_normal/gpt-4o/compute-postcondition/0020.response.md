The statement `continue` is used to skip the remainder of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided, the execution context remains unchanged aside from noting that we would move to the next iteration if we were within a loop.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1, the values of the variables do not change as a result of this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and must be greater than 1; `i` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration in the loop if there is one.**
