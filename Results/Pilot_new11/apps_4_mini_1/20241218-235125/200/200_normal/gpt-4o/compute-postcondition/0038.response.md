Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer satisfying 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `total_volume` is the sum of integers in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the function maintains the current values of `n`, `s`, and `volumes`, and `total_volume` remains less than `s`. If `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `remaining_kvass` > 0, then `min_keg_volume` is adjusted by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`; otherwise, `min_keg_volume` remains unchanged.***
