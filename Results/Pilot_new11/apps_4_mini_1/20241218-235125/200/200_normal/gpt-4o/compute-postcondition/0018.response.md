Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `i` is 0; if `remaining_kvass` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that no more kvass can be taken. If `remaining_kvass` is not 0, the program continues to process the next possible take.***
