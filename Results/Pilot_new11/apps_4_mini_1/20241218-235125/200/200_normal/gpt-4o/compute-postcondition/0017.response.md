The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Since `remaining_kvass` is currently equal to 0, it indicates that we cannot take more kvass. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `i` is 0; `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`; `possible_to_take` has been calculated but not used; `remaining_kvass` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
