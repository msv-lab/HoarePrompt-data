Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `remaining_kvass` is equal to 0, then `remaining_kvass` remains 0, `possible_to_take` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no action specified.***
