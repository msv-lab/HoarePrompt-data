To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and how the code implements those requirements.

**Problem Description:**
1. The program must read integers `n` and `s`, where `n` is the number of kegs and `s` is the amount of kvass the Fair Nut wants to pour.
2. It must also read a list `v` of integers representing the volume of kvass in each keg.
3. The goal is to calculate how much kvass can remain in the least full keg after pouring `s` liters of kvass from the kegs. If pouring `s` liters is not possible, it should return `-1`.

**Analysis of the Annotated Program:**
- The program reads the input values correctly.
- It sorts the list of keg volumes to facilitate the binary search.
- It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum amount of kvass that can remain in the least full keg after pouring `s` liters.
  - The `mid` variable represents a potential minimum volume in the least keg after pouring.
  - The `total` calculates how much kvass can be poured without exceeding `s`, based on the constraint that no keg can be drawn below `mid`.
- After the binary search concludes, it checks:
  - If the total amount of kvass actually equals `s`, it prints `low`.
  - If it does not equal `s`, it prints `-1`.

**Key Points of Evaluation:**
1. The program correctly handles the scenario when it's impossible to pour `s` liters by checking if the total available kvass is less than `s`.
2. It properly implements the logic to maximize the amount of kvass remaining in the least-full keg.
3. It accounts for the edge cases (like extreme values of `s`) through both the binary search mechanism and checks after the loop.

Translation of the program's functionality into the problem requirements shows that:
- The binary search correctly finds the highest possible minimum value that satisfies the sum constraint.
- The check for final value equals to `s` ensures correctness regarding whether pouring the requested amount of kvass is possible, aligning with the problem's requirement.

Given that the logic adheres to the specified task and handles the necessary conditions outlined in the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True**
