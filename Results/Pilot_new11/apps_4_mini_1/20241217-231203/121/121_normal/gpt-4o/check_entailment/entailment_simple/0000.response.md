To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will evaluate the program step by step:

1. **Input handling**:  
   The program reads an integer `n` and a string `s`, which is consistent with the problem's description.

2. **Checking for divisibility by 4**:  
   The program correctly checks if `n` is not a multiple of 4. If not, it prints `"==="`, which matches the expected output when the genome cannot be decoded equally.

3. **Counting nucleotides**:  
   The counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are correctly accumulated in a dictionary, which aligns with the requirement to keep track of how many of each nucleotide we have.

4. **Checking if any count exceeds the target**:  
   The program checks if any nucleotide count exceeds the target count. If any nucleotide appears more than `n // 4`, it correctly prints `"==="` as no decoding will maintain equal distribution.

5. **Replacing '?' with valid nucleotides**:  
   The program iteratively replaces '?' in the string with the appropriate nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') until all characters are present in the required equal count. This part is executed correctly, ensuring that the result string maintains the equal nucleotide requirement.

6. **Output**:  
   Finally, the program outputs the modified string.

Considering all of the above points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description: it handles cases where it is impossible to achieve an equal distribution by outputting `"==="`, and it reconstructs the genome correctly when feasible.

There are no direct flaws in logic or cases where the output would deviate from expectations based on the problem description provided. Each step is purposeful and adheres to the constraints and requirements set forth.

Thus, the conclusion for the correctness check is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
