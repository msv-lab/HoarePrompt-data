Correctness: **True**

The provided code fulfills all the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s how it meets each aspect of the description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input, where `n` represents the length of the genome and `s` contains characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

2. **Length Check**: It correctly checks if `n` is a multiple of 4 (`n % 4 != 0`). If it's not, it immediately outputs '===' as required by the problem.

3. **Count Validation**: The program counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string and stores these counts in a dictionary. It then verifies if any of these counts exceed the `target_count` (which is `n // 4`). If any count is exceeded, the program correctly outputs '==='.

4. **Replacement of '?':** The program iterates over the string `s` and whenever it encounters a '?', it replaces it with either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' based on the conditions that ensure none of these exceed the `target_count`. This means it is ensuring each nucleotide type appears equally in the decoded genome.

5. **Output Requirements**: Finally, the program prints the modified string, which will consist of each nucleotide equally when possible. If the replacements cannot achieve the requirement, it handles this appropriately by returning '==='.

Every scenario according to the specifications in the problem description is addressed by the logic in the code. Therefore, the code operates correctly within the defined constraints and meets the expectations set by the problem description.
