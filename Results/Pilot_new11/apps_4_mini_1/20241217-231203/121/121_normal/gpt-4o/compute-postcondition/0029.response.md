Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` contains at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. For every character `char`, `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the program returns nothing. If `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`, then the program continues without an explicit return value.***
