Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `result` contains all characters from `s` with '?' replaced by valid characters from `counts` as necessary, `counts` will hold the counts of each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') adjusted accordingly based on the replacements made, ensuring that for each character, its count is either equal to or not exceeding `target_count`. If there were no '?' characters in `s`, then `result` will be equal to `s`, and `counts` will remain unchanged.**
