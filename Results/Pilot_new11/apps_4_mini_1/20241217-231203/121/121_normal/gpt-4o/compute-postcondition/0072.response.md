Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a non-empty string, and `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1 (while remaining less than or equal to `target_count`) and `result[i]` is set to `char`. We then break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
