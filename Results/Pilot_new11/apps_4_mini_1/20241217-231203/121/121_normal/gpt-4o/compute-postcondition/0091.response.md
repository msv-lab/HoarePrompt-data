Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` stays the same, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` includes 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[i]` is set to `char`, and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. If `counts[char]` is not less than `target_count`, there is no change to `result[i]` or `counts`.***
