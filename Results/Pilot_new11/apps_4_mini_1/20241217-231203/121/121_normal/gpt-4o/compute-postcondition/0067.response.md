Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the number of characters in `s` that were replaced with valid characters from `counts`, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result[i]` is set to `char`, `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
