Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that were replaced with valid characters from `counts` plus 2, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` includes 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with values equal to or greater than `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `result[i]` is equal to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `counts[char]`, and the state remains consistent with the conditions established in the precondition.***
