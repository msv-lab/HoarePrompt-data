Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that were replaced with valid characters from `counts` plus 2, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` includes 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with values that are equal to or less than `target_count`. If `result[i]` is '?', then `result` holds valid characters from `counts` that satisfy the conditions of the loop, and `result[i]` may be assigned a valid character from `counts` if the loop runs; otherwise, `result[i]` remains unchanged.***
