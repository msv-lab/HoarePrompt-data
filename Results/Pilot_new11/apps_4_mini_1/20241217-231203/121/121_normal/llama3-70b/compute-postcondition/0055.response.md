The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length `n`, `count[nc]` is greater than or equal to 0 (specifically `count[nc] - 1`), `res` is updated to include the characters added in place of '?', `c` is the next character in `s`, `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT', and we break out of the most internal loop.
