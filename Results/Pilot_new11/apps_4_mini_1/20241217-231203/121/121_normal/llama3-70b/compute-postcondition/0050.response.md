The value of the variables does not change, but we break out of the loop of the function or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State remains: `s` is a string of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 0), `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, `res` is updated to include the characters added in place of '?', `c` is the next character in `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or statement.
