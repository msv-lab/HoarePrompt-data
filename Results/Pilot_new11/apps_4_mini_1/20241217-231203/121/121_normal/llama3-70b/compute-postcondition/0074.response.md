The statement `res += nc` means that the variable `res` is being concatenated with the value of `nc`. Since `res` includes `nc`, the new value of `res` will be the original value of `res` plus `nc` again. The variable `nc` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`s`, `count[nc]`, `c`) also remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length `n-1`, `count[nc]` must be greater than 0, `res` now includes two instances of `nc`, `c` is still the next character in the string `s`, `nc` is still the next character in 'ACGT'.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n-1`, `count[nc]` must be greater than 0, `res` includes two instances of `nc`, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT'**.
