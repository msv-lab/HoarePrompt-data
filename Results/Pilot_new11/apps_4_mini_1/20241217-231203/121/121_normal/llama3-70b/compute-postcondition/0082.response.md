Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n-1`, and `count[nc]` is greater than 0 after being decremented by 1 when `count[nc] > 0`. As a result, `res` includes three instances of `nc`, and `nc` is either 'C', 'G', 'T', or 'A'. In this case, the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
