Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in one particular aspect: it does not account for the case where the number of unrecognized nucleotides (represented by '?') is insufficient to make the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' equal.

Specifically:

1. The program calculates the required count for each nucleotide as `avg = n // 4`, which represents how many of each nucleotide are needed for the total to be equal. The program then calculates how many more of each nucleotide are needed by subtracting the counts from this `avg`.

2. When processing the string `s`, if `'?'` is encountered, the program replaces it with a nucleotide from 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' based on what is still needed (updating the `count` accordingly).

3. However, the program does not check if the total number of '?' is actually enough to fulfill the required counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Therefore, if there are too few '?' characters to achieve equal counts, the program would still print the constructed string rather than "===".

This oversight means that there could be scenarios where the correct output is "===" (indicating that it is impossible to decode the genome), but the program would incorrectly output a valid sequence. 

For example, for the input:
```
8
A?C?G??T
```
The program would replace the '?'s to produce a valid sequence but it might not fulfill the condition that all nucleotides are present in equal numbers. Therefore, the program could produce invalid results under certain inputs.

Thus, the program does not consistently follow the specifications set by the problem description. 

In conclusion, it is essential to check not only the current counts of nucleotides but also whether there are enough '?'s available to meet the required counts. This lack of validation leads to incorrect outputs for certain cases, so the correctness of the program is evaluated as false.
