The code prints 0 to the output but does not change any variable in the program. The values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` remain unchanged. The condition that `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1` is still valid after execution. Since the print statement does not affect any variables or the state of conditions, the output state is simply a reflection of the unchanged variable values.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `cnt2` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `cnt3` is an integer between 0 and 10^9 and is greater than `cnt1`, `cnt4` is an integer between 0 and 10^9.**
