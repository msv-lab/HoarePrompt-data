The value of `cnt_2` is now assigned the value of `int(input())`, which will be an integer input. The values of `cnt_1`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an integer such that 0 <= `cnt_3` <= 10^9, `cnt_4` is an integer such that 0 <= `cnt_4` <= 10^9**
