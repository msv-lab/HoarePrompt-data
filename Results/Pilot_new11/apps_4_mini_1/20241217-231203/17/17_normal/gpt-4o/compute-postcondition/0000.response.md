The variable `cnt1` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, while the variables `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` retain their initial integer states within the bounds of 0 to \(10^9\). 

Output State: **`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are integers such that 0 <= `cnt_i` <= 10^9 for i in {1, 2, 3, 4}; `cnt1` is an input integer.**
