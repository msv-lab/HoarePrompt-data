The provided program aims to check if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence from the given counts of strings of type `cnt1` ("(("), `cnt2` ("()"), `cnt3` (")("), and `cnt4` ("))"). Let's analyze the logic in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. A regular bracket sequence is valid if:
   - The total number of opening brackets is precisely matched by the total number of closing brackets.
   - At every point in the sequence, the number of closing brackets does not exceed the number of opening brackets.

Given the four types of strings:
- cnt1 contributes +2 opening brackets.
- cnt2 contributes +2 balanced brackets (1 opening + 1 closing).
- cnt3 contributes -1 opening (1 closing bracket before an opening).
- cnt4 contributes -2 closing brackets.

### Conditions Derived from the Problem:
- The total opening brackets supported by `cnt1` and `cnt2` should match the total closing brackets supported by `cnt3` and `cnt4`.
- Condition 1: \( (cnt1 + cnt2) = (cnt3 + cnt4) \)
- Condition 2: To ensure that at every point, we never have more closing brackets than opening brackets, we need the count of opened brackets up to that point to always remain non-negative. This condition can be encapsulated as \( cnt2 \geq cnt3 \).

### Code Logic:
- The line `if (cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3)` checks both conditions derived from the above analysis.
- If both conditions are met, it prints `1`, indicating a valid regular bracket sequence can be formed. If not met, it prints `0`.

### Conclusion:
The logic correctly follows the problem description by enforcing:
- The equality of the total count of opening brackets and closing brackets.
- The requirement that the count of direct opening bracket pairs ("()") is at least equal to the count of closing brackets that precede an opening bracket (")(").

Therefore, the provided program meets the requirements and handles all necessary cases outlined by the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**
