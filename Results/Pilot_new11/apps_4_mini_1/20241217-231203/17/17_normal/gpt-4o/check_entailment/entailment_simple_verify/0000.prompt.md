You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1
4

Output
1

Input
0
0
0
0

Output

Input

4

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the code:

The condition in the program checks if the total number of opening brackets (from `cnt1` and `cnt2`) equals the total number of closing brackets (from `cnt3` and `cnt4`) and also ensures that there are enough closing brackets to match the opening brackets when starting the sequence (i.e., `cnt2 >= cnt3`).

However, there are potential cases not handled correctly by the program:

1. Let's say all `cnt_i` are `0` (i.e., `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 0`, and `cnt4 = 0`). The function will return `1`, which is correct since an empty string is a valid regular bracket sequence.
   
2. Now, consider the case where `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 0`, and `cnt4 = 0`. The function will evaluate `1 + 0 == 0 + 0` (which is `False`), so it will print `0`. However, the string would just be `"("`, which is not valid, so this works correctly.

3. Another edge case to check is when `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 1`, `cnt3 = 0`, and `cnt4 = 1`. The program would evaluate `0 + 1 == 0 + 1` (which is `True`) and check `1 >= 0` (which is also `True`), thus returning `1`. Yet, the string formed would be `")("`, which is not valid, so this case fails.

This indicates that there are cases that exist where the program will yield an incorrect output based on the conditions laid out.

Based on this analysis, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 are integers such that 0 <= cnt_i <= 10^9 for i in {1, 2, 3, 4}.
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if (cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(0)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are integers. If the sum of `cnt_1` and `cnt_2` equals the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` and `cnt_2` is greater than or equal to `cnt_3`, then the value `1` is printed. Otherwise, the output is `0`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
