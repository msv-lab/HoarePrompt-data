The line of code reads input from the standard input and assigns it to a variable named `input`. This code does not modify any of the existing variables `N`, `M`, `K`, or `L`, nor does it assign any specific values to them.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18; variable `input` is assigned the result of `sys.stdin.read`**.
