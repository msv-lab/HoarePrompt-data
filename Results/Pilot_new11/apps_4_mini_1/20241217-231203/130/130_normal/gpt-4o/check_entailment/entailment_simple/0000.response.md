To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let’s analyze the logic of the program step by step.

### Analyzing the Problem Description
The problem requires:

1. All friends must gift an equal number of coins.
2. All gifted coins must be different.
3. At least `L` coins must be new to Ivan's collection.

### Given Variables
- `N`: Total number of different collectible coins.
- `M`: Number of Ivan's friends.
- `K`: Number of coins Ivan already has.
- `L`: Minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.

### Main Logic of the Program
1. **Calculating `min_x`:**
   - The program calculates `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`. This expression ensures that we round up the division of `L` by `M`, giving us the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift in order to satisfy the requirement of at least `L` new coins.

2. **Conditional Check:**
   - The program checks if the total number of different coins that `M` friends can give (`M * min_x`) is less than or equal to the number of new coins available (`N - K`). 
   - If this condition is satisfied, then the program prints `min_x`, otherwise it prints `-1` indicating it's impossible to meet the conditions.

### Correctness Verification
Let’s evaluate if the program satisfies all three conditions laid out in the problem:

- **Equal gifts:** The calculation of `min_x` ensures that all friends gift the same number of coins. This condition is satisfied as `min_x` is used as the quantity each friend gifts.
  
- **Different coins:** The check `M * min_x <= N - K` ensures that the total number of coins given by friends does not exceed the available different coins left after accounting for what Ivan already has.

- **At least L new coins:** By ensuring that `min_x` is calculated to satisfy the new coin requirement, the program guarantees that at least `L` coins will be new.

### Edge Cases
- In scenarios where `M * min_x` exceeds `N - K`, the program correctly identifies that it is impossible to meet the gift requirements and outputs `-1`. This handles cases where the number of friends exceeds the number of distinct coins available.

### Conclusion
Since the program adheres to the problem description and logically ensures that all conditions are met for any valid input combination, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
