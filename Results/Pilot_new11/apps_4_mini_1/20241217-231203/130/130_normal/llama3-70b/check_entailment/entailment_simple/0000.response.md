Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, leading to inaccurate outputs in certain cases.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - Ivan has K coins already.
   - M friends must gift coins such that:
     - All gifts are different.
     - At least L of the coins gifted must be new to Ivan (not in his current collection of K coins).

2. **Conditions to Check**:
   - The maximum number of new coins that can be gifted is `N - K`, since there are `N` different coins in total and Ivan already has `K`.
   - There must be at least `M` different coins given, which means the total number of coins given must be at least `M`, but more importantly, at least L of those must be new.

3. **Given Conditions in the Code**:
   - The code checks whether `M >= N - K + 1`, which is not a correct comparison to check the new coin requirements. This condition means that the friends can cover all possible new coins plus the K coins, which is irrelevant because they need to ensure the selection of new coins distinguishes from Ivan's existing collection.
   - The second condition `M >= L` is correctly checking if the number of friends is sufficient to meet the requirement of having at least L new coins.

4. **Missing Logic**:
   - The logic that determines how to calculate the gifts such that both M friends can give coins and at least L of those must be new is absent. Specifically, the program fails to correctly account for the scenario where it might not be possible to find a number `x` (gifts per friend) such that all conditions are met, particularly the constraints posed by L.

5. **Correct Output**:
   - In cases where M is greater than N - K but K + M < L, the function would incorrectly return `1`, but the correct response should be `-1` because it's impossible to meet the condition of having L new coins.

Thus, the program fails to capture the necessary logic to validate that M friends giving x coins can meet the overall conditions of uniqueness and new additions to Ivan's collection. The algorithm should consider cases where the total gifts can empower new coins while also confirming that all M friends can provide unique coins. 

Hence, it does not implement the requirements of the problem correctly for all potential cases.
