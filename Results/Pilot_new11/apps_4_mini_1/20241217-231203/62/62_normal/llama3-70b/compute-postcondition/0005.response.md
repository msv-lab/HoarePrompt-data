According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 elements and `digit` is the second element of the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `digits` must have at least 3 elements, `result` must equal the new `digit`, which will be the third element of the list, and `digit` would then represent this third element.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements; `result` is equal to `digit`; `digit` is the third element of the list `digits`.**
