According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. Since the list must have at least 1 element, it can execute one more time as long as there is at least one more digit left in `digits`. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is equal to `digit`, which is the first element of the list. To execute one more time, we need to take the next element in the `digits` list. Since `digit` is now the first element in the list, we need to increment our index to get the next `digit`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, the state must reflect that we will be using the second element in the `digits` list, which requires the `digits` list to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `result` is 0, `digit` is the second element of the list `digits`**
