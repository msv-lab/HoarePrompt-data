Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description and performs the required comparisons between two numbers represented in different bases. Here's an explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y. It also reads the respective digits and stores them in lists.

2. **Function for Conversion**: The `func_1` function converts the list of digits from the given base to a decimal integer. The implementation of the conversion is correct, as it accumulates the result by multiplying the current result by the base and adding the next digit, which adheres to the mathematical definition of base conversion.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After both numbers are converted to decimal, the program compares them using the standard relational operators. It handles the three possible outcomes (`<`, `>`, `=`) correctly.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints Handling**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, including constraints on the values of digits, the bases, and the characteristics of the input (e.g., no leading zeroes).

There are no potential inputs that would cause the program to behave incorrectly according to the problem statement. All possible cases within the defined constraints have been accounted for in the logic. Hence, the program is correct.
