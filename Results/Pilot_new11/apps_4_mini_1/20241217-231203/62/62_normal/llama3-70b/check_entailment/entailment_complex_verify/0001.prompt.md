You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output

15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9
4 8 0 3 1 5 0

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description and performs the required comparisons between two numbers represented in different bases. Here's an explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of digits and the base for both numbers X and Y. It also reads the respective digits and stores them in lists.

2. **Function for Conversion**: The `func_1` function converts the list of digits from the given base to a decimal integer. The implementation of the conversion is correct, as it accumulates the result by multiplying the current result by the base and adding the next digit, which adheres to the mathematical definition of base conversion.

3. **Comparison Logic**: After both numbers are converted to decimal, the program compares them using the standard relational operators. It handles the three possible outcomes (`<`, `>`, `=`) correctly.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints Handling**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, including constraints on the values of digits, the bases, and the characteristics of the input (e.g., no leading zeroes).

There are no potential inputs that would cause the program to behave incorrectly according to the problem statement. All possible cases within the defined constraints have been accounted for in the logic. Hence, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, bx) = map(int, input().split())
x_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, by) = map(int, input().split())
y_digits = list(map(int, input().split()))
x = func_1(x_digits, bx)
y = func_1(y_digits, by)
if x < y:
    print('<')
elif x > y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in the given base, where each integer is in the range 0 to base-1, and base is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 40. The number of digits in the list is between 1 and 10.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a list of integers representing digits of a number in the given base, `result` is the number represented by `digits` in the given `base`, where `base` is an integer between 2 and 40, and the length of `digits` is between 1 and 10.
    return result
    #The program returns the number represented by 'digits' in the given 'base', where 'base' is an integer between 2 and 40, and 'digits' is a list of integers representing the digits of that number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, which represent the digits of a number in the specified base `base`, and an integer `base` that can range from 2 to 40. It computes the corresponding integer value of the number represented by `digits` in that base and returns this value. The function assumes that the integers in `digits` are within the valid range for the given base (0 to base-1). There are no checks for invalid digits or cases where the length of `digits` is outside the specified range; thus, if `digits` contains values not in this range, the function will not handle that gracefully. Additionally, while the function operates over a limited number of digits (1 to 10), it does not account for scenarios where the input list might be empty or invalid input types. Overall, it successfully transforms the representation of the number into its base 10 equivalent for valid input but lacks robust input validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
