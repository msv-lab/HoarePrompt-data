The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It converts two numbers from their respective bases into base 10, then compares these converted values and outputs the appropriate relational operator ('<', '>', or '='). 

Given the constraints:
- The digits are always within the valid range (as per given inputs), as the problem guarantees that there are no leading zeros and that both numbers are positive.
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the integer value of the number represented by the digits in the given base. 

The output hints correctly summarize the function's behavior, noting its valid range and the absence of input validation checks that are not needed given the problem constraints. Since the problem statement assumes valid input will be provided and all provided test cases in the examples align with the program's behavior, we do not find violations of the requirements.

Thus, considering all of the above, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
