Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. It reads the input values correctly, extracting the number of digits and corresponding bases for both numbers X and Y.
2. It defines the function `func_1` that converts a given list of digits from a specified base into its decimal (base-10) equivalent. This is done using the formula `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit`, which appropriately computes the value in decimal form.
3. After converting both numbers to their decimal representations using the `func_1` function, the program compares the two decimal values and prints the correct symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison.

Since the program correctly handles the conversion for all valid inputs specified in the problem statement, including edge cases such as minimum and maximum base constraints, and it adheres to the given digit restrictions, it achieves the intended functionality without errors. 

Thus, I cannot find any input case where the program fails to meet the requirements stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Hence, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
