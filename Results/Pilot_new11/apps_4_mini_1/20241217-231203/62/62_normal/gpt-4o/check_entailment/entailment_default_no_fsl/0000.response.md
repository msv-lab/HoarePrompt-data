Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It accepts two numbers represented in different bases and outputs the appropriate comparison between those two numbers. 

The main points regarding correctness are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the inputs for two numbers, including base and digits.
2. **Base Conversion**: The `func_1` function accurately converts the base representation of the input numbers X and Y into their decimal equivalents. It does this by iterating through the list of digits, multiplying the accumulated decimal value by the base and adding the current digit, thus handling the positional value correctly.
3. **Comparison of Values**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program accurately compares them and prints the correct relational symbol ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison results.

Since the input format and assumption around validity are clearly stated in the problem description and the helper function `func_1` works as intended within the constraints given (valid digits and non-empty lists), the program behaves correctly for all specified test cases as well as any valid edge cases implied by the input constraints. 

There are no potential edge cases or examples that break the logic of the program based on the provided problem description, hence the determination of correctness is True.
