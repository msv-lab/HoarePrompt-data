The statement `decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit` updates the value of `decimal_value`. The previous value of `decimal_value` is equal to `digit`, which is the second element of `digits`. Now, `decimal_value` will be calculated by multiplying its previous value by `base` and adding `digit` to it. 

Since `base` is an integer within the range 2 to 40 and `digit` is an integer (the second element of the `digits` list), we can write the updated value of `decimal_value` as:

```
decimal_value = (digit) * base + digit
```

Other variables maintain their previous states. Hence, the Output State will include:

- `digits` is a non-empty list of integers that must have at least 2 elements,
- `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40,
- `decimal_value` has been updated to `(digit * base + digit)`.

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is equal to `digit * base + digit`.**
