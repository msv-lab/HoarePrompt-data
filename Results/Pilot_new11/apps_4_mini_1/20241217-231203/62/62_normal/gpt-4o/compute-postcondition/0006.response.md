The code snippet updates the `decimal_value` by multiplying it with `base` and adding the current `digit`. Given that `digits` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `decimal_value` is initially set to the next digit in the list. This means we are working with the current value of `decimal_value` and one of the integers from the `digits` list.

Since the exact values of `decimal_value` and `digit` are not specified, we denote them generally. After the execution of the code, `decimal_value` will be updated according to the formula provided.

Let's denote the following:
- Let `d_n` be the next digit in the `digits` list being referenced.
- Let `decimal_value_initial` be the initial value of `decimal_value`.

Thus, after the code executes, we have:
- `decimal_value` = `decimal_value_initial * base + d_n`

The information about other variables remains unchanged, so we will express the output state accordingly.

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers that must have at least 3 elements; `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40; `decimal_value` = `decimal_value_initial * base + d_n`.**
