Postcondition: ***`total` is the sum of the minimum values between `mid` and each element in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `mid`, retaining the conditions that `low` must be less than `high`, `min(v)` must be greater than 1, and `mid` remains equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while maintaining the same conditions over `total`, `low`, and `mid`.***
