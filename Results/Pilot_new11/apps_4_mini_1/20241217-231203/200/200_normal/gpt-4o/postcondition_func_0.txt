The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `s`, and a list of integers `volumes`. It checks if the total volume of the kegs is at least `s`. If it is not, the function prints `-1`. If it is, the function calculates the minimum volume that can be obtained from the kegs after attempting to reduce the `remaining_kvass` amount by taking volumes from kegs that exceed the minimum keg volume. If any `remaining_kvass` remains after processing all eligible kegs, it adjusts the minimum keg volume downwards based on the amount of remaining kvass and the number of kegs. The final result printed is either the updated minimum keg volume or, if all `remaining_kvass` was taken, the original minimum keg volume. The function directly interacts with user input and output, returning no values but printing results instead.
