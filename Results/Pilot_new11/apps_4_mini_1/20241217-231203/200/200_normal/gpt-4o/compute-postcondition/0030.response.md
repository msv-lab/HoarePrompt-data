Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `remaining_kvass` is not equal to 0. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `remaining_kvass` is updated to its previous value minus `possible_to_take`, where `possible_to_take` is calculated as `min(volumes[2] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`.***
