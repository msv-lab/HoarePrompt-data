According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is at least 1, it implies that it could be 1 or more. If `n` is exactly 1, after this iteration, `i` becomes 2, which would prevent the loop from executing again. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, allowing `i` to increment to 2. Additionally, if `remaining_kvass` was equal to 0 at the end of the last iteration, the loop would have already terminated, meaning `remaining_kvass` must remain not equal to 0 for another iteration to happen. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states should be adjusted:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `remaining_kvass` is not equal to 0**
