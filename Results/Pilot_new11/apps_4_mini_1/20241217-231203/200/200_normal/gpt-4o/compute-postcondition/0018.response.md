Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0. If `remaining_kvass` is equal to 0, no changes occur in `remaining_kvass` or the current loop iteration. Otherwise, `remaining_kvass` decreases by `possible_to_take` if `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`, and the control breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
