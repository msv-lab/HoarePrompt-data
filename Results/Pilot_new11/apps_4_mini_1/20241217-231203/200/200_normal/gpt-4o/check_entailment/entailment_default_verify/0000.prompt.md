You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We have `n` kegs with given volumes of kvass.
   - We need to pour exactly `s` liters of kvass.
   - We want to maximize the minimum kvass level in the kegs after pouring out the `s` liters.
   - If it's not possible to pour `s` liters, we should return `-1`.

2. **Key Cases**:
   - If the total volume of kvass across all kegs is less than `s`, the program should return `-1`.
   - After calculating the amount that can be taken from kegs while maintaining a certain minimum level, we need to ensure that we're adjusting the minimum level correctly based on how much kvass is poured and remaining.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The volumes of kegs are sorted, and the total volume is checked.
   - The program attempts to maximize the minimum keg volume by determining how much can be taken from each keg while respecting the current minimum.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - There’s an assumption that once we've taken kvass from kegs higher than the minimum, the remaining kvass can be evenly distributed across all kegs to further enhance the minimum level. This might not always hold true especially if the `remaining_kvass` is more than the number of kegs (`n`), in which case it needs to ensure that it doesn't reduce the minimum below the lowest keg.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
    - For inputs where we have to pour a significant amount from very unequal kegs, the logic of adjusting the minimum may fail to account for edge cases.
    - For example, if we have kegs with volumes `[1, 1, 10]` and we need to pour `8` liters:
      - The total volume is `1 + 1 + 10 = 12`, which is valid since `12 >= 8`.
      - However, pouring `8` liters will lead to `1 liter` in the first two kegs and `2 liters` in the last keg, which means the minimum keg volume will be `1` at the end, making the program incorrectly decrease the lowest keg past its minimum limit.

In this case, the handling of `remaining_kvass` seems faulty. 

Let's denote this issue directly:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly maintain the invariant of the minimum keg volume in certain edge cases where a significant volume must be taken from unevenly distributed kegs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `s`, and a list of integers `volumes`. It checks if the total volume of the kegs is at least `s`. If it is not, the function prints `-1`. If it is, the function calculates the minimum volume that can be obtained from the kegs after attempting to reduce the `remaining_kvass` amount by taking volumes from kegs that exceed the minimum keg volume. If any `remaining_kvass` remains after processing all eligible kegs, it adjusts the minimum keg volume downwards based on the amount of remaining kvass and the number of kegs. The final result printed is either the updated minimum keg volume or, if all `remaining_kvass` was taken, the original minimum keg volume. The function directly interacts with user input and output, returning no values but printing results instead.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
