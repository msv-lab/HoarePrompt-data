To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's dissect the requirements and functionality of the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The Fair Nut wants to pour `s` liters from `n` kegs of kvass such that the volume in the least full keg is maximized after pouring `s` liters. If it's not possible to pour `s` liters from the kegs, the program should output `-1`.

### Key Requirements:
1. If the total volume of kvass in all kegs is less than `s`, the output should be `-1`.
2. If it is possible to pour `s` liters:
   - The minimum volume in the kegs after pouring should be maximized.
   - The output should be that maximum value.

### Analyzing the Annotated Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads two integers `n` (number of kegs) and `s` (liters to pour).
   - It reads a list of integers representing the kvass volume in each keg.

2. **Total Volume Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `total_volume`, which is the sum of all kvass in kegs.
   - If `total_volume < s`, it correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Maximizing Minimum Volume in Kegs:**
   - The program sorts the keg volumes.
   - The `min_keg_volume` is initialized as the smallest keg's volume.
   - It iterates through each keg to calculate how much can be taken from it (if it's greater than `min_keg_volume`).
   - Any remaining kvass needed after this initial extraction is spread evenly across the kegs by adjusting `min_keg_volume`.

4. **Final Logic:**
   - If there are liters still needed after attempting to pour from the available volumes, it adjusts `min_keg_volume` down based on how many kegs are available (`(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` calculates how much each keg must lose to meet the remaining need).

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The logic correctly finds the maximum minimum volume left in the kegs that can sustain a pour of `s`.
- It comprehensively checks whether pouring `s` liters is even possible, adhering strictly to the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program does exactly what the problem description requires. It handles the edge case where `s` liters cannot be poured and appropriately maximizes the volume in the least full keg as intended.

Therefore, I conclude with:
Correctness: **True**
