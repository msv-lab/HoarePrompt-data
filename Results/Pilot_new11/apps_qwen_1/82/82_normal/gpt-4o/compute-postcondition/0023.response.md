Let's break down the task step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value.
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
- `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1.
- `current_lcm` is the current least common multiple.
- `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far.
- `min_k` is the smallest candidate that resulted in `min_lcm`.
- `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is calculated as \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\).

### For Loop Statement:
```
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over two values: `k` and `diff // k`. We need to consider both cases:

#### Case 1: `candidate = k`
- `new_b` is recalculated as \((b + k - 1) // k * k\).
- `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

#### Case 2: `candidate = diff // k`
- `new_b` is recalculated as \((b + (diff // k) - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)\).
- `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

### Updated States:
To determine the new states, we need to update the relevant variables based on the above analysis:

- `new_b` will be updated based on the current `candidate` value.
- `new_a` will be updated based on the current `candidate` value.
- The logic for updating `min_lcm` and `min_k` remains the same.

### Updated State:
- `a` will be updated to `new_a`.
- `b` will be updated to `new_b`.
- `new_b` will be the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to the original `b`.
- `diff` will be updated to the absolute value of `a - b`.
- `new_a` will be the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

Given these updates, the new states for the next iteration of the loop are:

**State:**
- `a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `b` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to the original `b`.
- `new_b` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1.
- `new_a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `b` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to the original `b`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of the current `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`**.
