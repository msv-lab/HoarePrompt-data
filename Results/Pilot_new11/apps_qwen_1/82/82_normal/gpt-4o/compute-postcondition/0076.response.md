The `current_lcm` variable is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Since the function `func_2` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`, but we know that it is now the result of calling `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The states of the other variables (`new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far; `min_k` is the smallest value of `k` that achieves `min_lcm`.**
