The code updates the value of `new_b` based on the formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Since `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, and `new_b` is calculated using this formula, the value of `new_b` will be a multiple of `candidate`.

Let's denote the original value of `b` as `b_original`. After applying the formula, the value of `new_b` will be:

\[ new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate \]

Since `candidate` can be either `k` or `diff // k`, let's consider both cases:

1. If `candidate = k`:
   \[ new_b = (b + k - 1) // k * k \]
   
2. If `candidate = diff // k`:
   \[ new_b = (b + diff // k - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k) \]

In both cases, `new_b` will be a multiple of `candidate`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `new_a`, `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `diff // k`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k`.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`; `k` is a positive integer; `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) where `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`; `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.**
