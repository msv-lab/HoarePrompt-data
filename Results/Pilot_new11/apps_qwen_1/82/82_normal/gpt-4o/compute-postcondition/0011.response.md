First, let's understand the initial state and the operations performed:

- `a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. This means `a` is rounded up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
- `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and must be at least 1.
- `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `a` is updated to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.
- `b` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) (inclusive) and different from `a`.
- `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1.

Since `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` and no specific implementation of `func_2` is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `current_lcm`. However, we can state that `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value, `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1, and `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
