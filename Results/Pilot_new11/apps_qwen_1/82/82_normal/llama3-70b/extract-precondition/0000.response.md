Precondition: **a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).** 

Note: The `func_1` function is not provided, but based on the context, it likely computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, as the least common multiple (LCM) calculation involves GCD. However, the precondition focuses solely on the input variables `a` and `b` without referencing `func_1`.
