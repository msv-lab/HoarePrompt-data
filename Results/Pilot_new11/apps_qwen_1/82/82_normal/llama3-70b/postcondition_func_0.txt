The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the loop, the variable `a` is set to the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is then returned. The function correctly handles all valid inputs within the specified range, but it does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is zero. If either `a` or `b` is zero, the function still executes the loop but the behavior is undefined since the loop condition `while b:` will terminate immediately, leaving `a` unchanged. However, due to the nature of the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself. Therefore, the function implicitly handles this case by returning `a` when `b` becomes zero.
