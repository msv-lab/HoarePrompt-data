Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Instead, the program contains two functions related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, but it does not utilize them to solve the problem.

To solve this problem, the approach should involve finding the difference between \( a \) and \( b \) and using the GCD to determine the smallest \( k \). Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

- The program defines a function to compute the GCD (`func_1`) and another to compute the LCM (`func_2`), but it does not use these functions to find the optimal \( k \).
- The problem requires finding the smallest \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. This involves analyzing the differences and using the properties of GCD to determine \( k \).

For example, consider the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \). The correct output should be \( k = 2 \), but the provided program does not compute this value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
