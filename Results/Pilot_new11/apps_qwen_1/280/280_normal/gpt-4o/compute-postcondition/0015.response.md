Functionality: **The function `func` accepts four parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`, where `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10. It calculates the total distance traveled over `t` time units given initial speed `v_1`, final speed `v_2`, and a constant acceleration `d`. For each time unit from 1 to `t-1`, the speed is determined as the minimum of either the previous speed plus `d` or a linearly decreasing value starting from `v_2` and decreasing by `d` per unit time. Finally, it prints the total distance traveled.**

**Edge cases:**
- If `d` is 0, the speed remains constant at `v_1` for all time units.
- If `t` is 2, the only speeds calculated are `v_1` and `v_2`.

**Missing functionality:**
- The provided annotations and return postconditions do not align with the actual code behavior. The function does not return any tuples as stated in the annotations. Instead, it simply calculates and prints the total distance traveled. Therefore, the annotations are incorrect and should be disregarded.
