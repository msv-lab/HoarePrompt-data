Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\), `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\), `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` minus `d` if it is greater than `min_speed`, otherwise it is `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`.**
