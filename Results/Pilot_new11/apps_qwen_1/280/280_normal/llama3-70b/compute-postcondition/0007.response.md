The code changes the value of `max_speed` by setting it to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. Given the initial state:

- `v1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100
- `v2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t`
- `i` is `t - 1`

After executing the line `max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`:

- `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of its current value minus `d` and `min_speed`.
- The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100, `v2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` minus `d` if it is greater than `min_speed`, otherwise it is `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1**
