Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where all cakes have the same volume. According to the problem description, if all cakes have the same volume, the maximum volume should be the volume of one cake. However, the provided `func_1` implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results in such cases. Specifically, the `dp` array is initialized with the individual volumes, and the dynamic programming logic does not update these values when all volumes are equal. Therefore, the function will not produce the correct maximum volume in cases where all cakes have the same volume.
