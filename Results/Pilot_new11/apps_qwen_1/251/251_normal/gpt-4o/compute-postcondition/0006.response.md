Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but reads two inputs from the standard input: the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of cakes, and the second input is a space-separated list of integers representing the radii and heights of the cakes. It then processes this data to call another function `func_1` with the values of `n` and the list of cakes, and prints the result formatted to six decimal places. If the input values are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000), the function will correctly compute and print the result. However, if the input values are outside these ranges, the function will still process them, but the results may not be meaningful. There are no explicit checks to validate the input constraints within the given code.**
