The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `cakes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(r_i, h_i)` represents the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000. The function returns a value based on the calculations or conditions applied to the parameters.

However, since the specific output cases are not detailed in the provided information, we can only state the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and `cakes` (a list of tuples, where each tuple (r_i, h_i) represents the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000).**
