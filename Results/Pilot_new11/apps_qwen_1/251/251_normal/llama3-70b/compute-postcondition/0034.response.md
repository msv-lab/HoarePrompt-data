Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a number greater than 1
   - `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`
   - `dp[2]` is updated to either `cakes[2][0]` or the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for some valid `j`
   - `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for some valid `j`

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so the loop will iterate over `j` from 0 to 1.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - After the first iteration (when `j` is 0), `dp[0]` will be updated based on the value of `cakes[0][0]`.
   - After the second iteration (when `j` is 1), `dp[1]` will be updated based on the value of `cakes[1][0]`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will start from 0 again, but `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect `i` being 3, and ensure that the conditions for `n` still hold (i.e., `n` is greater than 1).

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be a number greater than 1.
   - `dp[1]` remains unchanged as `max_value_1`.
   - `dp[2]` remains updated as before.
   - `dp[3]` will be initialized or updated based on the values of `cakes[3][0]` and possibly other values from `dp`.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`, `dp[2]` is updated to either `cakes[2][0]` or the maximum value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for some valid `j`, and `dp[3]` is updated to the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for some valid `j`**.
