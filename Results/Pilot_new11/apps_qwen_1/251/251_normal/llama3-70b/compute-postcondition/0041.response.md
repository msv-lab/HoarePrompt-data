Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is a number greater than 1
- `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`
- `dp[2]` is the maximum value of `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]` or `dp[2] + cakes[2][0]`
- For every `k` in the range of `2` to `n-1`, `dp[k+1]` is the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[k+1][0]` for some valid `j` (where `j` can be any index from `1` to `k`).

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 until `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `n`, it cannot increment further unless we change the value of `i` to something less than `n`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` needs to be set to `1` (the starting point of the loop) for the next iteration.
- `n` remains the same as it is a constant for the problem.
- `dp[1]` remains `max_value_1` as it does not depend on the loop iteration.
- `dp[2]` is calculated based on the initial values and does not change within the loop.
- For each `k` in the range of `2` to `n-1`, `dp[k+1]` is updated based on the previous values, but these values do not change for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a number greater than 1, `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`, `dp[2]` is the maximum value of `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]` or `dp[2] + cakes[2][0]`, and for every `k` in the range of `2` to `n-1`, `dp[k+1]` is the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[k+1][0]` for some valid `j` (where `j` can be any index from `1` to `k`).**
