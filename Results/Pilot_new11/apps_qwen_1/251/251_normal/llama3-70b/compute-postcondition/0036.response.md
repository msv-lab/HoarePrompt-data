Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `dp[1]` remains as `max_value_1`, `dp[2]` is the maximum value of `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]` or `dp[2] + cakes[2][0]`, and `dp[3]` is the maximum value between `max_value_1` and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for some valid `j` (where `j` can be 1 or 2). This is true regardless of the condition in the if statement since there is no else part that modifies these variables differently.***
