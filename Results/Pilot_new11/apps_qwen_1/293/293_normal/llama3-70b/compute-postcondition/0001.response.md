The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables (`h` and `n`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^`h`; `ans` is 0**
