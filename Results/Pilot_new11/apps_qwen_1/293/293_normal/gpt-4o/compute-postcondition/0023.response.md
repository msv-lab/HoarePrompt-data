Postcondition: ***`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is the remaining part of the original path (two characters shorter), `current_level` is 1. Depending on the value of `direction`, `current_node` can be either 7, 9, 8, 10, 12, or 14. Specifically, if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is either 7 or 9. Otherwise, `current_node` is either 8, 10, 12, or 14 depending on the first character of the original `path`.***
