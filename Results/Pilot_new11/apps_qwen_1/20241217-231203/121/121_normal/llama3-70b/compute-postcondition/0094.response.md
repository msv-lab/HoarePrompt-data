Functionality: **The function processes an input string `s` of length `n`, which consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It first counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`, excluding the '?' characters. Then, it adjusts these counts to ensure that each character 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' appears approximately `n // 4` times by either decrementing or incrementing their counts. After this adjustment, it constructs a new string `res` by replacing all '?' characters in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' in the order 'ACGT' based on their adjusted counts. If the adjusted counts are not all zero, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the constructed string `res`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 4 (the minimum length), and when the adjusted counts cannot perfectly match `n // 4`.**
