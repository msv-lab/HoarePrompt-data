Postcondition: ***`s` must have at least one character, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values all equal to 0, `avg` is `n // 4`. If `c` equals '?', `res` remains an empty string. Otherwise, `res` is the string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' based on the conditions in the loop, and `res` is now appended with the character `c`.***
