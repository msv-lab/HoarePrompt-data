Postcondition: ***`nc` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'. If `c` is '?', `res` is the longest prefix of `s` that consists of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the order 'ACGT' based on their counts in `count`, and `count` is updated accordingly. If `c` is not '?', `res` is the next character `c` in the string `s`.***
