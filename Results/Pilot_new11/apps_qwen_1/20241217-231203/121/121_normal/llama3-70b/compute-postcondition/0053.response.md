`res` is assigned the value of `res` plus `nc`. Since `nc` is 'C', `res` is incremented by 'C'. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it is now concatenated with 'C'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nc` is 'C'; `res` is `res` concatenated with 'C'.

Output State: **`nc` is 'C'; `res` is `res` concatenated with 'C'**
