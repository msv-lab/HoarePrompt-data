Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the first input line, `s` is an empty string, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values representing the count of corresponding characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the original string `s`. If any character `c` in the string `s` is not '?', then `count[c]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `c` in `s`.**
