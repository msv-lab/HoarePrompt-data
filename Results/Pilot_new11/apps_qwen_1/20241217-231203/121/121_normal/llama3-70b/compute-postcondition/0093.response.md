The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains an integer `n` indicating the length of the genome string, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The value of `n` is between 4 and 255 inclusive.

The function returns nothing explicitly mentioned in the provided output cases. However, based on the given constraints, the function processes the string `s` which is of length `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and process the string `s` accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` indicating the length of the genome string and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and processes the string `s` accordingly.**
