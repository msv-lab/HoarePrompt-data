Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, or `count['T']` must be greater than 0. `nc` moves to the next character in the string 'ACGT'. If `count[nc] > 0`, `res` is updated to `res + nc` and `count[nc]` is decreased by 1. Since there is no else part, if `count[nc] <= 0`, no changes occur to `res` and `count[nc]` remains unchanged.***
