The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `n`. This input is expected to be the length of the genome string `s`, which is specified in the next line of input.

Given the initial state:
- The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` indicating the length of the genome string, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `n` is now known as an integer, but the string `s` is still as originally input and has not been modified yet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the first input line, and `s` is the string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'**.
