Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, or `count['T']` must be greater than 0; `nc` is the next character in 'ACGT'; `res` is updated to `res + nc`; `count[nc]` is decreased by 1.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition of the if statement directly applies to the entire if-else block. The if condition ensures that `count[nc] > 0`, and if this condition is met, `count[nc]` is decreased by 1 and `res` is updated to `res + nc`.
