`count[nc]` is decremented by 1. The value of `nc` is 'C', so `count['C']` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nc` is 'C'; `res` is `res` concatenated with 'C'; `count['C']` is `count['C'] - 1`.

Output State: **`nc` is 'C'; `res` is `res` concatenated with 'C'; `count['C']` is `count['C'] - 1`**
