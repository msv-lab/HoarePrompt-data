Postcondition: **`count[nc]` is decremented by 1 if `count[nc] > 0`. If `count[nc]` is not greater than 0, no change is made to `count[nc]`. The variable `nc` remains as an index used in `count`, and `res` remains undefined. We break out of the most internal loop or switch statement if `count[nc]` is greater than 0.**
