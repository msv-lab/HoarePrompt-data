`res` is incremented by `nc`. Given that `nc` is 'C', `res` is updated to be its current value plus 'C'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nc` is 'C', `count[nc]` remains unchanged, and `res` is the original value of `res` plus 'C'.

Output State: **`nc` is 'C', `count[nc]` remains unchanged, and `res` is the original value of `res` plus 'C'.**
