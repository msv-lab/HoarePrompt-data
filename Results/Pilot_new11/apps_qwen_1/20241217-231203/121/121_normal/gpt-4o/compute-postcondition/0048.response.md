Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing the string representation of the new integer `n` and the string `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of occurrences of that character in the string `s` and for the key `char`, the count of `char` is less than or equal to `target_count`, and `result` is a list of characters from the string `s` where the first element is either `char` (if `counts[char] < target_count`) or remains `'?'` (if `counts[char] >= target_count`).***

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition directly follows the postcondition of the if part. If the condition `counts[char] < target_count` is true, then `result[1]` is set to `char`, and if the condition is false, `result[1]` remains `'?'`.
