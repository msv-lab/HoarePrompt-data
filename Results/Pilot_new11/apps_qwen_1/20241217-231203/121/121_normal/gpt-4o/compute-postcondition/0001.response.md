The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. Since the input consists of two lines, the first line containing an integer `n` and the second line containing a string `s` of length `n`, the `input()` function will read these two lines. After splitting, `data` will contain two elements: the first element is the integer `n` as a string, and the second element is the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing an integer between 4 and 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is `s`.**
