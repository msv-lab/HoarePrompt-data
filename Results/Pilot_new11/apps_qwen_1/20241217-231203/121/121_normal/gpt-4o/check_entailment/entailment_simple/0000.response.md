Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input from standard input (stdin) as described. It correctly parses the first line to get the length \( n \) of the genome and the second line to get the genome string \( s \).

2. **Initial Validation**:
   - The program checks if \( n \) is divisible by 4. If not, it prints `"==="` and exits. This ensures that it is possible to have an equal number of each type of nucleotide.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The program counts the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the genome string \( s \). It uses a dictionary `counts` to store these counts.

4. **Validation of Counts**:
   - The program verifies that the count of each nucleotide in \( s \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{n}{4} \). If any nucleotide count exceeds \( \frac{n}{4} \), it prints `"==="` and exits. This step ensures that the genome can be balanced by replacing '?' with any of the nucleotides.

5. **Decoding**:
   - The program iterates through the genome string \( s \). For each `'?'`, it replaces it with a nucleotide such that the final counts of each nucleotide become exactly \( \frac{n}{4} \). It ensures that the first available nucleotide with a count less than \( \frac{n}{4} \) is used.

6. **Output Generation**:
   - The program constructs the final decoded genome by joining the list `result` into a single string and prints it.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles all edge cases specified in the problem description, including the validation steps to ensure the genome can be balanced.
- It provides a solution for decoding the genome if it is possible, and outputs `"==="` if it is not possible.
- The logic is sound and ensures that the output meets the criteria of having an equal number of each type of nucleotide.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
