Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` plus the previous elements, `x` is the last value that made `visited[x]` `True` for the second time, `cycle` is a non-empty list containing all the values of `x` taken during the loop execution, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `n`. This holds true whether `not visited[i]` is `True` or `False`.***
