The code snippet `p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))` converts the sublist `data[1:n + 1]` into a list of integers and assigns it to `p`. This means that the elements in `data` from index 1 to index `n` (inclusive) are now converted to integers.

- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from converting the elements in `data[1:n + 1]`.
- The value of `b` remains unchanged because it is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the first element of `data`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from index 1 to index `n` (inclusive) of `data`, `b` is the sublist of `data` starting from the n+2th element to the end.**
