Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` plus the previous elements, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i_new`), and `i_new` must be less than `n`. If `not visited[i_new]` is `True`, `visited[i_new]` is marked as `True`. If `not visited[i_new]` is `False`, nothing changes.***
