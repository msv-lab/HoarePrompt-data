The code `data = input().split()` reads the entire input as a single string and then splits it into a list of strings. The original values of `n`, the permutation `p`, and the sequence `b` are still valid but are now stored in the `data` list. The `data` list will contain the split values from the input.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split values from the input, `n` is the first element of `data` as an integer, `p` is the sublist of `data` starting from the second element to the n+1th element, and `b` is the sublist of `data` starting from the n+2th element to the end.**
