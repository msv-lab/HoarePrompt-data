The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream, which consists of three lines:
1. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), representing the number of skewers.
2. The second line contains a permutation of integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}` (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n).
3. The third line contains a sequence `b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}` consisting of zeros and ones.

After processing this input, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to read and process the specified input, but there is no return value described.

Functionality: **The function reads three lines of input: an integer `n`, a permutation of integers, and a sequence of zeros and ones, and processes this input.**
