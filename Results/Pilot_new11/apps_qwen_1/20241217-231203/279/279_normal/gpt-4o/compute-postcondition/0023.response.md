Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `p` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `cycles` is still an empty list; `cycle` contains the sequence of values that `x` took during the loop execution; `x` is updated to the last value taken in the loop, which is `p[x] - 1` and is within the range `[0, n-1]; `visited[x]` is `True`.**
