`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the value of `x` has been marked as visited. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `p` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `cycles` is still an empty list; `cycle` contains the original value of `x` followed by the updated value of `x`; `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1` and is within the range `[0, n-1]; `visited[x]` is `True`.**
