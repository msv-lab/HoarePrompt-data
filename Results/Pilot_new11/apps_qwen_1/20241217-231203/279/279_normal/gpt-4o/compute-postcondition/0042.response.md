The code `cycles.append(cycle)` appends the list `cycle` to the end of the list `cycles`. This does not change the values of `n`, `p`, `b`, `visited`, `x`, `cycle`, or `i`. The only change is that `cycles` now contains its previous elements plus the new element `cycle`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` plus the previous elements, `x` is the last value that made `visited[x]` `True` for the second time, `cycle` is a non-empty list containing all the values of `x` taken during the loop execution, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `n`.**
