You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), representing the number of skewers. The second line contains a permutation of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n). The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the loop execution, each cycle is a list of integers representing the sequence of indices `x` followed during the loop execution.
    no_reverse_components = sum(all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle) for cycle in cycles)
    if (len(cycles) == 1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the loop execution, each cycle is a list of integers representing the sequence of indices `x` followed during the loop execution, `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles in `cycles` where every element satisfies `b[x] == 0`. The output of the program is `0` if `len(cycles) == 1`, otherwise it is `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0, otherwise 1.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
