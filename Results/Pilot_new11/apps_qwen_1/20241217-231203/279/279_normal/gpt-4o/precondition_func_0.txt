The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), representing the number of skewers. The second line contains a permutation of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n). The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones.
