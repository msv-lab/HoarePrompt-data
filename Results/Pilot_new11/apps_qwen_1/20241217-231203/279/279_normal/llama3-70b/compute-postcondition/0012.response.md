`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` was initially 2 if `b[i-1]` equals 0, and remains 1 otherwise. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be 3 if `b[i-1]` equals 0, and 2 otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 3 if `b[i-1]` equals 0, and 2 otherwise, `i` is `i + 1`, all other variables retain their initial conditions.**
