`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `p` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.**
