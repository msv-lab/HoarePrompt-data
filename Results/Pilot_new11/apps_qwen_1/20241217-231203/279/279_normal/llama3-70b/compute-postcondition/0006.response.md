The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was not previously defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 before this line of code is executed. After executing the line, `ans` will be 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and for all indices `i`, the value of `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; for all indices `i`, the value of `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`; `ans` is 1**
