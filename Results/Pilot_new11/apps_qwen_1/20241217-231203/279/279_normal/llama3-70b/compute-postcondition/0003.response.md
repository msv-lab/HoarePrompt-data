The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `p` is a list of integers read from input, which is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers read from input, which is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`; `ans` is 0**
