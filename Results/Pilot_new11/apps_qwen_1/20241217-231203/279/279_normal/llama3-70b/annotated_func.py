#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a permutation of length n consisting of integers from 1 to n, and b is a sequence of n integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `ans` is the count of positions where `p[i]` does not equal `i + 1` or `b[i]` equals 0, `p` and `b` are permutations of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.

After executing the function, the final state of the program is:
- The variable `ans` contains the count of positions where either `p[i]` does not equal `i + 1` or `b[i]` equals 0.
- The function prints the value of `ans`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `b` contains any 0, the function will increment `ans` for each such position, and the printed value of `ans` will reflect this.
- If all elements in `b` are 1, the function will only increment `ans` for positions where `p[i]` does not equal `i + 1`.
- The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result. Therefore, the postcondition about returning `False` or `True` based on the content of `b` is incorrect.
