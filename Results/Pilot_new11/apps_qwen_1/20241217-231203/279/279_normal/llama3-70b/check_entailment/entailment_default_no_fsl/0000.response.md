Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic in the code is flawed because it only counts the number of positions where `p[i]` does not equal `i + 1` or `b[i]` equals 0. This does not ensure that every skewer will visit all 2n placements.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4
4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0
```

- The current implementation would output `4` because each `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and each `b[i]` is 0.
- However, the correct solution would be to change the permutation to something like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and keep `b` as it is, which requires only 1 change.

The code fails to account for the fact that reversing the skewers (`b[i]` being 1) can help in ensuring that each skewer visits all positions. Additionally, the current approach does not guarantee that the resulting permutation remains a valid permutation after changes.

Therefore, the code does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case.
