The code snippet `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` updates the value of `current_cost`. Initially, `t` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\). The length of list `a` is \(n - 2\).

- `t` remains unchanged, so `t` is 1.
- `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to its current value. Since `t` is 1, this simplifies to `current_cost += length - 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 2` to its current value, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to \(n - 2\)**.
