`current_cost` is assigned the value 0, which replaces its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element is between 1 and 100, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is 2.**
