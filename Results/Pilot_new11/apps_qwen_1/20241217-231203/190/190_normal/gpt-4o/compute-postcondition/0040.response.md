`current_cost` is incremented by `t - 1 - length`. Given the initial state, `t` is 2, and `length` is 2 (since `a` is a list of at least one element and its length is specified as 2). So, the calculation for `current_cost` is as follows:

- Initial `current_cost` is 1.
- `t - 1 - length` evaluates to `2 - 1 - 2 = -1`.

Therefore, `current_cost` is updated to `1 + (-1) = 0`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and each element is between 1 and 100, length is 2, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is 0, and `best_t` is 1.**
