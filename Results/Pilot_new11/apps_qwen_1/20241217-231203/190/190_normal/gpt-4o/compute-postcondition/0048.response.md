Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 2, `current_cost` is either its original value plus `1 - a[1]` or `a[1] - 3`, `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` is 1, and `length` is `a[1]`. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated to its original value plus `1 - a[1]`; otherwise, `current_cost` is updated to `a[1] - 3`.***
