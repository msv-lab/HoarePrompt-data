Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - \( t \) is 1.
   - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \).
   - \( a \) is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of \( a \) is equal to \( n - 1 \).
   - If \( \text{length} < t - 1 \), then \( \text{current\_cost} \) is -2.
   - Otherwise, \( \text{current\_cost} \) is calculated based on \( n \): 
     - \( 2n - 5 \) if \( n > 3 \),
     - \( 1 \) if \( n = 3 \),
     - \( 0 \) if \( n < 3 \).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements in the list \( a \). 

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the states at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The variable \( t \) starts at 1 and does not change within the loop.
   - \( n \) remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop and is not modified inside the loop.
   - The variable \( a \) is a list, and the loop iterates over its elements one by one.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume we have processed one element from the list \( a \).

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - After processing one element, the length of the list \( a \) decreases by 1.
   - Therefore, the new length of \( a \) is \( (n - 1) - 1 = n - 2 \).

6. **Current Cost Calculation:**
   - Since \( t \) is 1, the condition \( \text{length} < t - 1 \) is always false because \( t - 1 = 0 \) and \( \text{length} \geq 0 \).
   - Hence, the current cost calculation is not relevant for this specific iteration since \( t = 1 \).

7. **Next Iteration States:**
   - \( t \) remains 1.
   - \( n \) remains unchanged.
   - The new length of \( a \) is \( n - 2 \).
   - The new condition for the loop to continue is that the length of \( a \) must be non-negative, i.e., \( n - 2 \geq 0 \), which simplifies to \( n \geq 2 \).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to \( n - 2 \).**
