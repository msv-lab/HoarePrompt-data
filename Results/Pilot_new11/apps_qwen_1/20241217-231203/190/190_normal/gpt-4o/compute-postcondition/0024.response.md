Let's analyze the loop and derive the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For each element `length` in `a`, the following logic is applied:
- If `length < t - 1`, then `current_cost` is incremented by `t - 1 - length`.
- If `length > t + 1`, then `current_cost` is incremented by `length - (t + 1)`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` starts at 1.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`.

### Step-by-Step Iteration

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t = 1`
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
   - `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`.
   - `min_cost = float('inf')`
   - `best_t = -1`
   - `current_cost = 0`

2. **First Iteration**:
   - If `length < t - 1` (which is `0` since `t = 1`), then `current_cost` is incremented by `t - 1 - length`.
   - If `length > t + 1` (which is `2` since `t = 1`), then `current_cost` is incremented by `length - (t + 1)`.

   After the first iteration:
   - `current_cost` is updated based on the first element in `a`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each subsequent element `length` in `a`, the `current_cost` is updated according to the conditions mentioned above.

4. **Final Iteration**:
   - After all elements in `a` have been processed, the final value of `current_cost` will depend on the values of the elements in `a`.

### Final Output State

To derive the final state, we need to consider the maximum possible impact of the loop on `current_cost`.

- If all elements in `a` are between 1 and 100, and considering the constraints of the loop:
  - If `length < t - 1` (i.e., `length < 0`), this condition cannot be met since `length` is at least 1.
  - If `length > t + 1` (i.e., `length > 2`), the maximum possible value of `length` is 100. Therefore, the maximum increment to `current_cost` per iteration would be `100 - 2 = 98`.

Since `t` remains 1 throughout the loop, the only way `current_cost` can increase is when `length > 2`.

### Conclusion

After all iterations of the loop:
- `t` remains `1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` is still a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`.
- `current_cost` is the sum of increments due to elements in `a` that are greater than 2. Each such element contributes `length - 2` to `current_cost`.

### Output State

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`. `current_cost` is the sum of `(length - 2)` for all `length` in `a` that are greater than 2.**
