The initial state includes: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to \( n - 1 \), and `current_cost` is \( \text{len}(a) - 2 \) if \( \text{len}(a) > 0 \), otherwise `current_cost` is 0.

The code snippet updates `current_cost` by adding `length - (t + 1)` to `current_cost`. Here, `length` refers to the length of the list `a`.

Let's break this down:

1. The length of `a` is \( n - 1 \).
2. Substituting `length` with \( n - 1 \), the expression `length - (t + 1)` becomes \((n - 1) - (1 + 1)\), which simplifies to \( n - 2 \).

Therefore, the updated `current_cost` is calculated as:
\[ \text{current_cost} += (n - 1) - (1 + 1) = \text{current_cost} + (n - 2) \]

Given the initial value of `current_cost`:
- If \( \text{len}(a) > 0 \), then `current_cost` is \( \text{len}(a) - 2 \), which simplifies to \( n - 3 \).
- If \( \text{len}(a) = 0 \), then `current_cost` is 0.

After executing the code, `current_cost` will be updated as follows:
- If \( n > 3 \), then `current_cost` becomes \( n - 3 + (n - 2) = 2n - 5 \).
- If \( n = 3 \), then `current_cost` becomes \( 0 + (3 - 2) = 1 \).
- If \( n < 3 \), then `current_cost` remains 0 because the condition for updating `current_cost` is not met.

So, the updated states are:
- `t` is still 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `current_cost` is updated based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to \( n - 1 \), and `current_cost` is \( 2n - 5 \) if \( n > 3 \), \( 1 \) if \( n = 3 \), and \( 0 \) if \( n < 3**.
