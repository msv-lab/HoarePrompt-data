Functionality: **The function accepts an integer \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \). It then iterates over possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100, calculating a cost for each \( t \) based on the differences between \( t \) and the elements in \( a \). The cost is defined such that if an element \( a_i \) is less than \( t - 1 \), the cost is increased by \( t - 1 - a_i \), and if \( a_i \) is greater than \( t + 1 \), the cost is increased by \( a_i - (t + 1) \). After evaluating all possible \( t \), the function identifies the value of \( t \) that results in the minimum cost and prints this value along with the corresponding minimum cost. If there are multiple values of \( t \) that result in the same minimum cost, the function will still identify one of them.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If all elements in the list \( a \) are equal to \( t \), the cost will be zero for all \( t \), and the function will return the first \( t \) evaluated.
- If no elements in the list \( a \) are less than \( t - 1 \) or greater than \( t + 1 \) for any \( t \), the cost will also be zero for all \( t \), and the function will return the first \( t \) evaluated.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the input \( n \) or any element in the list \( a \) is outside the specified ranges (\( n \) should be between 1 and 1000, and each element in \( a \) should be between 1 and 100). While these checks are not explicitly mentioned in the provided code, they should be considered as part of the function's expected behavior. If these constraints are violated, the function's behavior is undefined.
