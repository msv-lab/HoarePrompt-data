The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`, and the code does not change the value of `n` (it only reassigns it), the value of `n` remains within this range.

The list `a` is not affected by the given code, so it retains its initial state as a list of `n` integers such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100` for all `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100` for all `i`.**
