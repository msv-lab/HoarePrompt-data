Postcondition: ***`t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and 5 if they are greater than 4, otherwise it is 0, and `min_cost` is the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop, with `best_t` remaining 2 unless `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, in which case `best_t` becomes 4.***
