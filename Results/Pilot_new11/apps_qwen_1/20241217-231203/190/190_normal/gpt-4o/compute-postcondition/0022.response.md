Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to \(n - 2\). If `length` (which is the length of `a`) is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - 2` to its current value.**
