The variable `best_t` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `min_cost`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `best_t` and retains the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `min_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`; `a` is a list of integers such that each integer in `a` is between `1` and `100` and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `min_cost` is infinity (`float('inf')`); `best_t` is -1.**
