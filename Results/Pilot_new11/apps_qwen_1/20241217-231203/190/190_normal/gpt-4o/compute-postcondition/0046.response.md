The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` updates the `current_cost` by adding the value of `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `length` is the second element in the list `a` and `t` is 2, we can substitute these values into the equation.

Since `t` is 2, `t + 1` is 3. And `length` is the second element in the list `a`, which is `a[1]`. So, the expression becomes `current_cost += a[1] - 3`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers with length 2
- `current_cost` is 0
- `min_cost` is 0
- `best_t` is 1
- `length` is `a[1]`

After executing the code, `current_cost` will be updated to `0 + a[1] - 3`, which simplifies to `a[1] - 3`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 2, `current_cost` is `a[1] - 3`, `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` is 1, `length` is `a[1]`**
