The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `t - 1 - length`. Given the initial state, `t` is 1 and `length` is the length of the list `a`, which is \( n - 2 \) since `a` has \( n - 2 \) elements.

Substituting the known values into the equation:
- `t` is 1
- `length` is \( n - 2 \)

So, `current_cost += 1 - 1 - (n - 2)` simplifies to `current_cost += -n + 2`.

The output state after this operation is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to \( n - 2 \); `current_cost` is `current_cost` + (-n + 2)**.
