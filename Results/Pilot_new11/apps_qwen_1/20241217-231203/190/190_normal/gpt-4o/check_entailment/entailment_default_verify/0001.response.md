Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through all possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100, calculates the cost for each \( t \) based on the given formula, and keeps track of the minimum cost and corresponding \( t \). The output hints also confirm that the program evaluates all possible \( t \) values and selects the one with the minimum cost, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
