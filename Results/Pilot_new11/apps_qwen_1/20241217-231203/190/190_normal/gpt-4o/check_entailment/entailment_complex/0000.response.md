Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a` as required.
   
2. **Cost Calculation for Each Possible `t`**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100.
   - For each `t`, it calculates the cost of making all sticks "almost good" for `t`. The cost calculation is correct as per the problem description:
     - If a stick's length `length` is less than `t - 1`, the cost is added as `t - 1 - length`.
     - If a stick's length `length` is greater than `t + 1`, the cost is added as `length - (t + 1)`.
     - Sticks whose lengths fall within `[t-1, t+1]` do not incur any cost.

3. **Finding Minimum Cost and Corresponding `t`**:
   - The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` as it iterates through the possible values.
   - After evaluating all possible `t` values, it prints the value of `t` and the minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases as specified by the problem constraints (e.g., `1 <= n <= 1000` and `1 <= a_i <= 100`).
   - It ensures that the output is in the required format (value of `t` and the minimum cost).

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary cases, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is **True**.
