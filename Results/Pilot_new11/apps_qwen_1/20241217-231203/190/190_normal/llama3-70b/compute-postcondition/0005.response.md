`t` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`.
