According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 101. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid + 2`, and `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`. Also, `min_cost` is updated to `cost` if `cost < min_cost`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` will be `mid + 3`.

Since the loop does not directly update `cost` or `min_cost` in the given context, these values remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be `mid + 3`.
- `cost` remains the same.
- `min_cost` remains the same.

State: **`i` is `mid + 3`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`, and `min_cost` remains unchanged.**
