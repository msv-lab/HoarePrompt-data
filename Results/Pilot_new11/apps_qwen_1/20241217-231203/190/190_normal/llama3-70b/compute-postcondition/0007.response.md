`min_t` is assigned the value of `t`, which is equal to `mid`. The value of `t` does not change, and the value of `min_cost` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `t`.**
