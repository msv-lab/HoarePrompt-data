`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `i` remains `mid + 1` because the code does not change it. The value of `mid` and the calculation of `cost` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101, and `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`.**
