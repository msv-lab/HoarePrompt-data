`sticks` is sorted using the `sort()` method, which sorts the elements in `sticks` in ascending order. The original values of the elements in `sticks` are preserved but reorganized. The variable `n` remains unchanged as the length of `sticks` does not affect the sorting operation directly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100.**
