The code `mid = sticks[n // 2]` assigns the middle element of the list `sticks` to the variable `mid`. Since `sticks` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, the middle element is the one at index `n // 2`.

Given that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `n // 2` will give us the integer division of `n` by 2. This means:

- If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be the index of the exact middle element.
- If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be the index of the first of the two middle elements.

In both cases, `mid` will be assigned the value of the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`.**
