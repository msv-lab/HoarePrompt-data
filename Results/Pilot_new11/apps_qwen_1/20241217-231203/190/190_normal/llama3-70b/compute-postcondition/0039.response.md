`min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `mid + 3`. The other variables (`cost` and `min_cost`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `mid + 3`; `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`; `min_cost` is the same as the current value of `cost`; `min_t` is `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 3`; `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`; `min_cost` is the same as the current value of `cost`; `min_t` is `i`.**
