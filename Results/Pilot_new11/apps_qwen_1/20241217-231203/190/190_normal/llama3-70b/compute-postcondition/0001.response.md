The code `sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `sticks`. 

The initial state includes `n` (an integer between 1 and 1000) and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 100). After executing the given code, the list `a` will be replaced by the list `sticks` which is constructed from the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000; `sticks` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100; the input line was split, converted to integers, and stored in `sticks`.**
