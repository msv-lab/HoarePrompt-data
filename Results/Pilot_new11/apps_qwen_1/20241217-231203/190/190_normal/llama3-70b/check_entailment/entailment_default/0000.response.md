Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list `sticks` contains duplicate values. The median calculation assumes unique values in `sticks`, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
3
2 2 2
```

The correct output should be `2 0` because all sticks are already almost good for \( t = 2 \) and no changes are needed. However, the program will sort the list and set `mid` to 2, but it will not properly calculate the minimum cost due to the assumption of unique values. The program will iterate through possible values of \( t \) and might incorrectly conclude that a different \( t \) yields a lower cost.

To illustrate, let's run the program with the given input:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)

func()
```

For the input `3 2 2 2`, the output will be incorrect because the program does not properly handle the case of duplicate values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
