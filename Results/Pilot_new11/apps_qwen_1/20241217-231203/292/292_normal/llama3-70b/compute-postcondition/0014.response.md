Output State: **`a` is between 3<sup>years</sup> and 30<sup>years</sup>, `b` is between 2<sup>years</sup> and 20<sup>years</sup>, `years` is the number of times the loop executed.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).
- Each iteration of the loop triples `a` and doubles `b`, and increments `years` by 1.
- After `years` iterations, `a` will be \(3^{\text{years}} \times a_{\text{initial}}\) and `b` will be \(2^{\text{years}} \times b_{\text{initial}}\).
- Since \(a_{\text{initial}}\) and \(b_{\text{initial}}\) are between 1 and 10, after `years` iterations, `a` will be between \(3^{\text{years}}\) and \(30^{\text{years}}\) and `b` will be between \(2^{\text{years}}\) and \(20^{\text{years}}\).
- `years` will be the number of times the loop executed, which can be determined by the condition `a <= b` no longer being satisfied.
