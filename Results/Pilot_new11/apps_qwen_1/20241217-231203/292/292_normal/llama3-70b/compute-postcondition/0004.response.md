`b` is multiplied by 2. Since `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, multiplying it by 2 will result in a new value for `b`. The value of `a` and `years` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are: `a` is 3 times its original value (between 3 and 30 inclusive), `b` is now `2 * b` (which is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive), and `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times its original value (between 3 and 30 inclusive), `b` is 2 * b (an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive), and `years` is 0**
