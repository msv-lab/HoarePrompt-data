Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\)) from the user, then enters a loop where \(a\) is tripled and \(b\) is doubled in each iteration. The loop continues until \(a\) exceeds \(b\). After the loop ends, the function prints the number of iterations performed. The final state of the program is that the output is the number of iterations, and \(a\) and \(b\) are no longer within the initial constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are such that \(a > b\), the loop will not execute, and the function will print 0 immediately.
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are both 1, the loop will run once, and \(a\) will become 3 while \(b\) remains 1, resulting in a single iteration.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not modify or return \(a\) or \(b\); it only uses them for comparison and calculation purposes. However, the state of \(a\) and \(b\) changes within the function, and these changes are part of the final state of the program.
