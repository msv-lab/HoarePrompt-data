The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the integers entered by the user, but they must still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, and both satisfy \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\); the value of `b` is the second integer entered by the user.**
