Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `a <= b`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is 3 times its original value (between 3 and 30 inclusive).
   - `b` is 2 times its original value (between 2 and 20 inclusive).
   - `years` is 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must be less than or equal to `b` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Given the current values, `a` is 3 times its original value and `b` is 2 times its original value. This means `a` is at least 6 (since the minimum value of `a` is 3 * 2 = 6) and `b` is at most 40 (since the maximum value of `b` is 2 * 20 = 40). 

4. **Evaluate the condition `a <= b`**:
   - Since `a` is 3 times its original value and `b` is 2 times its original value, for the loop to continue, `a` must remain less than or equal to `b` in the next iteration.
   - Given that `a` starts at 6 and increases by some factor each iteration, and `b` starts at 4 and increases by some factor each iteration, we need to ensure that `a` does not exceed `b` before the next iteration begins.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `a` remains less than or equal to `b` in the next iteration. This means that `a` should still be 3 times its original value and `b` should still be 2 times its original value.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is 3 times its original value (between 3 and 30 inclusive), `b` is 2 times its original value (between 2 and 20 inclusive)**
