The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers separated by a space from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. Given the initial state that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), after running the code, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the integers provided by the input, but they must still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). The initial conditions for `a` and `b` are no longer specified, only the constraints.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive), `b` is an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive) such that `a` <= `b`**
