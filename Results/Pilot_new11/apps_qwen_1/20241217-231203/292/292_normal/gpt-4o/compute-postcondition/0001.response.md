The code initializes the variable `years` to 0. It does not affect the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the value of `a` remains an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive), and the value of `b` remains an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive) such that `a` <= `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive), `b` is an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive) such that `a` <= `b`, `years` is 0**
