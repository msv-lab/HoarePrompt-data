The function reads two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\)) from the standard input. It then enters a loop where `a` is multiplied by 3 and `b` is multiplied by 2 in each iteration until `a` exceeds `b`. The function counts the number of iterations required for this condition and prints the count. If `a` and `b` are such that `a` becomes greater than `b` immediately without entering the loop, the count will be 0. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it outputs the number of years (iterations) taken for `a` to become greater than `b`. If `a` is already greater than `b` when the function starts, the output will be 0.
