Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years required for Limak's weight to become strictly larger than Bob's weight. The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the program, indicating that it iterates through the process of tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will always find a point where Limak's weight will exceed Bob's weight due to the exponential growth rates involved. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints confirm its correctness.
