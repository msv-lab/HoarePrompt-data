Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This correctly handles the input as per the problem description.

2. **Loop Logic**: 
   - The program initializes a variable `years` to 0 to count the number of years.
   - It enters a loop where it triples Limak's weight (`a *= 3`) and doubles Bob's weight (`b *= 2`) each year.
   - The loop continues until Limak's weight (`a`) becomes strictly larger than Bob's weight (`b`).

3. **Termination Condition**: The loop exits when `a > b`, meaning Limak has become strictly larger than Bob.

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become larger than Bob.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the initial condition where `a` and `b` are within the specified range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10).
   - The loop ensures that the weights are updated correctly each year, and the program stops counting once the condition `a > b` is met.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description for all possible valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
