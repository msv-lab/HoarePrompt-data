Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- `n` is an integer input that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `a` is an integer input.
- `b` is an integer input.
- The expression `(n - x * a) % b` is not equal to 0.
- The loop iterates over `x` in the range from `0` to `n // a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `x` is less than `n // a + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is one less than the current value of `n // a + 1`. Let's denote this previous value of `x` as `x_prev`.
3. **Expression Check**: The expression `(n - x * a) % b` must not be equal to 0. This means that for `x_prev`, `(n - x_prev * a) % b != 0`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration

1. **Increment `x`**: In the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `x` will be `x_prev + 1`.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `x_prev + 1` must still be less than `n // a + 1`. Therefore, `x_prev + 1 < n // a + 1` must hold true.
3. **Expression Check for New `x`**: We need to ensure that the expression `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b` does not equal 0.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop.

### New State
- `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `b` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `x` will be incremented by 1, so `x` is now `x_prev + 1`.

### Conclusion

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`n` is an integer input that is greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, and the expression `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0.**

State: **`n` is an integer input that is greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, and the expression `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0.**
