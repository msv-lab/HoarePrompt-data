`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Here, `x` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state, so let's denote its current value as `x`. The expression `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0, but this does not affect the value of `y` directly. Therefore, the only change is in the assignment of `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input that is greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, and `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b` is not equal to 0.**
