To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer input.
- `a` is an integer input.
- `b` is an integer input.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over `x` in the range `n // a + 1`. For each iteration, it checks if `(n - x * a) % b == 0`. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y`, and then returns.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Case 1: The loop does not execute
- If `(n - x * a) % b != 0` for all `x` in the range `n // a + 1`, the loop does not execute.
- Therefore, `n` must be such that there is no integer `x` for which `(n - x * a) % b == 0`.

#### Case 2: The loop executes
- If the loop executes, there exists an integer `x` in the range `0` to `n // a` such that `(n - x * a) % b == 0`.
- When the condition is met, the loop prints 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y = (n - x * a) // b`.
- After printing, the function returns, so the values of `x` and `y` are known.

### Final Output State
- If the loop does not execute, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were initially.
- If the loop executes, `x` and `y` will be the values for which `(n - x * a) % b == 0` holds true, and the loop will print 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y`.

### Output State: 
- If the loop does not execute, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` and `b` are integers. There is no solution such that `(n - x * a) % b == 0` for any integer `x`.
- If the loop executes, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` and `b` are integers. There exists an integer `x` in the range `0` to `n // a` such that `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, and the loop prints 'YES' with the values `x` and `y = (n - x * a) // b`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` and `b` are integers. If the loop executes, there exists an integer `x` in the range `0` to `n // a` such that `(n - x * a) % b == 0`, and the loop prints 'YES' with the values `x` and `y = (n - x * a) // b`. If the loop does not execute, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were initially and there is no such `x` that satisfies the condition.**
