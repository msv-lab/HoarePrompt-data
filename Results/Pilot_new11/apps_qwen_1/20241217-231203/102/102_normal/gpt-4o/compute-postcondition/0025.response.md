Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It prompts the user to input three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), where \( n \) represents the amount of money Vasya has, \( a \) is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and \( b \) is the cost of one Bars bar. The function then checks if there exist non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( n - x \cdot a = y \cdot b \). If such integers exist, the function prints 'YES' followed by the values of \( x \) and \( y \). If no such integers exist, the function prints 'NO'.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( n < a \), the loop will not execute because \( x \) cannot be a non-negative integer within the specified range. In this case, the function will print 'NO'.
- If \( a \) and \( b \) are such that \( n - x \cdot a \) is never divisible by \( b \) for any \( x \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( n // a \), the function will print 'NO'.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where \( n \), \( a \), or \( b \) might be zero or negative. However, given the constraints \( 1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10,000,000 \), these values should always be positive.
