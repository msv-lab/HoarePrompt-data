Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly `n` burles. The program iterates through possible values of `x` (number of bottles of Ber-Cola) and checks if the remaining amount (`n - x * a`) is divisible by `b` (cost of one Bars bar). If such values of `x` and `y` (where `y = (n - x * a) // b`) exist, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If no such values exist, it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly checks for the possibility of spending exactly `n` burles by iterating through possible values of `x` and ensuring that the remaining amount can be exactly divided by `b` to get `y`. The program does not rely on invalid inputs or edge cases that are not specified, and it works for all valid inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
