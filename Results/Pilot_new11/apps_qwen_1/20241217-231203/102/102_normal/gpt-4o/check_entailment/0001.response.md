Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only checks if there exists a solution within the range of \(x\) from 0 to \(n//a\), which might miss solutions where \(x\) is greater than \(n//a\). For example, consider the following case:

- Input:
  ```
  10
  5
  3
  ```

The correct answer should be "YES" with \(x = 1\) and \(y = \frac{10 - 1 \cdot 5}{3} = \frac{5}{3}\), but since \(y\) must be an integer, we need to check further. However, the current implementation does not explore beyond \(x = n//a\), so it incorrectly prints "NO".

To fix this, the program should continue checking values of \(x\) beyond \(n//a\) until it finds a valid solution or exhausts all possibilities. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
    
    # Check if we missed any x beyond n//a
    for x in range((n // b) + 1):
        if (n - x * b) % a == 0:
            y = (n - x * b) // a
            print('YES')
            print(y, x)
            return
    
    print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible values of \(x\) are checked, including those greater than \(n//a\), ensuring the program works correctly for all potential cases.
