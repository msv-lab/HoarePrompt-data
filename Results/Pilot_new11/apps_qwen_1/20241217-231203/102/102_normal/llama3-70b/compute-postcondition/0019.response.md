The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. Based on the initial state, `x` is `x_current + 1` and `y` is `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b`. Since the code only prints these values without changing them, the output of the print function will be the current values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is `x_current + 1`, `y` is `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b`, and the console prints 'YES' x, y**
