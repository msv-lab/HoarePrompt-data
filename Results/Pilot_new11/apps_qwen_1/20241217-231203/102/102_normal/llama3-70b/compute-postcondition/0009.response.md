Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `n` is a non-negative input integer, `x` is unchanged, `y` is the value of `(n - x * a) // b`, and if the condition `x * a + y * b == n` is satisfied, then `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
