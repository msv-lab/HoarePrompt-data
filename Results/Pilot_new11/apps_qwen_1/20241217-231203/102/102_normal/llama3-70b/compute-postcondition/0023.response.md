The code `print('NO')` prints 'NO' to the console and does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the only impact is the output 'NO'. The values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is `n // a`, `y` is `(n - (n // a) * a) // b`, and the output is 'NO'**
