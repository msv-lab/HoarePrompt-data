`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is an input integer**
