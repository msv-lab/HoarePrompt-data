`total_coverage` is decreased by `cov`. The value of `cov` is the smallest element from the heap, so `total_coverage` becomes `0 - x - cov`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total_coverage` is 0 - x - cov, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `cov` is the smallest element from the heap, `x` is the second smallest element from the heap, `y` is the third smallest element from the heap.**
