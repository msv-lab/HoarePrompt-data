The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. All these parameters are integers with specific constraints: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5). The function also includes a call to `coverage(x, y)` which returns the number of possible scoop-net positions that would catch the fish placed at cell (x, y).

The function returns the value `(0 - k * cov) / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`, where `cov` is the result of the `coverage(x, y)` function call.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and return a calculated value based on the coverage of scoop-net positions and the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. It returns the value `(0 - k * cov) / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`, where `cov` is the result of the `coverage(x, y)` function call.**
