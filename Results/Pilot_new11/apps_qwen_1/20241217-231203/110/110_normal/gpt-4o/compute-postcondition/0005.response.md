`heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new element into the heap based on the negative coverage value calculated from `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, they are updated by the operation. However, we know the following:

- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `m` remains a positive integer.
- `r` must still be an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m).
- `k` must still be an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5).
- `heap` remains unchanged and still contains `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`.
- `y` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Since `y` starts at 1, `y` will be 1 after this operation. The new element pushed into the heap is `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`. The state of `heap` now includes this new element.

Output State: **`n` must still be greater than 0; `m` remains a positive integer; `r` must still be an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m); `k` must still be an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5); `heap` now contains `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)` and `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`; `y` is 1.**
