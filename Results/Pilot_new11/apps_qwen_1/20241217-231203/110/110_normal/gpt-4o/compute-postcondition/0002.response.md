Functionality: **The function `coverage` calculates the number of cells in a pond that can be covered by a scoop-net of size `r` when placed at coordinates `(x, y)`. Given the dimensions of the pond `n` and `m`, the function returns the product of the number of cells that can be covered horizontally and vertically from the point `(x, y)` considering the scoop-net's size `r`. The function handles edge cases where the scoop-net might extend beyond the boundaries of the pond. Specifically, it computes the effective range of the scoop-net in both the x and y directions, taking into account the boundaries defined by `n` and `m`, and then multiplies these ranges together to determine the total number of cells that can be covered.**

**Potential edge cases include scenarios where the scoop-net's size `r` is such that it would extend beyond the pond's boundaries, in which case the function correctly adjusts the range to fit within the pond's dimensions. For instance, if `(x - r + 1)` would be less than 0, it is set to 0, and similarly, if `(x + r - 1)` exceeds `n`, it is capped at `n`. The same logic applies to the y-coordinates with respect to the dimension `m`.**
