The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, representing dimensions of a grid, the radius of coverage for scoops, and the number of scoops, respectively. It returns the average reduction in coverage due to the placement of `k` scoops on the grid, normalized by the total number of possible positions for scoops not intersecting within the radius `r`. Specifically, it constructs a priority queue of all possible scoop positions based on their coverage, pops the `k` positions with the smallest coverage, subtracts their combined coverage from the total, and then normalizes this reduction by the total number of valid scoop positions.
