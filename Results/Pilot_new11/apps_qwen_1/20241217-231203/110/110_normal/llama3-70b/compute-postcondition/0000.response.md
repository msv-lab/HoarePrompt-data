The code `n, m, r, k = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` respectively. Since the initial state specifies the ranges for these variables, after reading the input, these variables will hold the values provided in the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial constraints:
- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5)`

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` will be the integers provided by the input, and the other variables (`total`, etc.) are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range [1, 100000]; `m` is an input integer within the range [1, 100000]; `r` is an input integer within the range [1, min(`n`, `m`)]; `k` is an input integer within the range [1, min(`n` * `m`, 100000)]**
