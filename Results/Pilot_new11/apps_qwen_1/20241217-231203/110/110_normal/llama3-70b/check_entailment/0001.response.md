Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. According to the problem description, the goal is to place \(k\) fishes in such a way that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized when the scoop-net is thrown randomly. However, the program simply calculates the minimum of \(k\) and the total number of possible positions for the scoop-net, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3 2 3
```
The correct output should be 2.0000000000 because placing the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3) would result in an expected value of 2.0, as mentioned in the problem statement.

However, the program outputs:
```
1.0
```
This is because the program calculates `ans` as `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`, which is 1 in this case. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for this input, making it incorrect.
