Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, the goal is to place \(k\) fishes in the pond such that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized when the scoop-net is thrown randomly. However, the provided code simply calculates the minimum of \(k\) and the product of \((n - r + 1)\) and \((m - r + 1)\), and then divides this minimum by the same product. This approach does not account for the optimal placement of the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

To maximize the expected number of caught fishes, we should aim to place the fishes in areas where the scoop-net has the highest probability of capturing them. The correct approach involves placing the fishes in a way that maximizes the overlap of the scoop-net with the fishes. This typically means placing the fishes near the center of the pond, where the scoop-net is more likely to intersect with multiple cells containing fishes.

The provided code does not address this requirement and thus fails to meet the problem's objective for every potential case.
