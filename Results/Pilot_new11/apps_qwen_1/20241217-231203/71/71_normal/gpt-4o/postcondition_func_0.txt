The function `func()` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer where \(0 \leq n \leq 2,000,000,000\)) and `k` (an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 9\)). It processes the string representation of `n` in reverse order to count the number of zeros until the count reaches `k`. Once `k` zeros are found, it calculates the number of digits in `n` that have not been processed and prints this value. If the loop exits without finding exactly `k` zeros, it prints `len(n) - 1`. The function ensures that both `n` and `k` are within their specified ranges. If `n` is less than 0 or `k` is out of the range \(1 \leq k \leq 9\), the function would encounter errors due to invalid inputs, although no explicit error handling is shown in the code.
