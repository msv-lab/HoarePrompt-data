Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where the number of trailing zeros is less than `k` and the first non-zero digit is not in the correct position to form a number divisible by \(10^k\).

### Example where the code fails:
Consider the input:
```
10203049 2
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to remove the minimum number of digits to make the number divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). The correct answer should be `3`, as removing the digits `1`, `2`, and `3` results in `0049`, which is divisible by 100.

However, the provided code only counts trailing zeros and stops once it finds `k` zeros. It does not consider the position of non-zero digits needed to form a number divisible by \(10^k\).

In the example above, the code would not correctly identify that removing three digits (`1`, `2`, and `3`) is necessary to achieve the desired result. Instead, it would incorrectly print the length of the string minus one, which is `8 - 1 = 7`.

To fix this, the code needs to consider the position of the first non-zero digit and ensure that the resulting number is divisible by \(10^k\). This involves more complex logic to handle various edge cases and positions of non-zero digits.
