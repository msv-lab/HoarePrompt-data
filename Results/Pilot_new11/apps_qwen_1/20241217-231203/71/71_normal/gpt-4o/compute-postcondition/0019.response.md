Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a non-empty string.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position.
   - `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the digits of `n` in reverse order using `reversed(n)`.
   - For each digit, `to_remove` is decremented.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-empty string.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position.
   - `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed (decremented by 1 in the previous iteration).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next digit from `n` must be processed.
   - Since we are iterating in reverse order, the next digit is the next character in the string `n` (from right to left).
   - `to_remove` will be decremented again.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `n` remains a non-empty string (since we haven't finished processing all its digits).
   - `k` remains an integer.
   - `count_zeros` remains the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position (no change unless the next digit is a zero).
   - `to_remove` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position, `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed minus 1**.
