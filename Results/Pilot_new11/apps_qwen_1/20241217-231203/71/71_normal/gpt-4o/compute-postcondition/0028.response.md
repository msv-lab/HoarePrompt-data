Postcondition: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is a non-negative integer, `count_zeros` is the total count of zeros in `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` is less than `k`, `to_remove` is the number of digits in `n` that have not been processed when the loop breaks or 0 if the loop does not execute.**
