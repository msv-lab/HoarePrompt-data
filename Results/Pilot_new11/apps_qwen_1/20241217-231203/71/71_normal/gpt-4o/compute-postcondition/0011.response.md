The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the execution simply exits the current context. None of the variables are modified by this statement. The conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0 based on whether the digit considered is '0', and `to_remove` is 1 if the digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 0. The condition `count_zeros == k` is true.**
