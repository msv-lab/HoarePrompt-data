The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Since `n` is not divisible by \(10^k\), it means that `n` was originally a number that when divided by 10 results in another number that is still not divisible by \(10^k\). However, since the exact value of `n` was not specified, we can only say that after executing the code, `n` is now `n // 10`.

The variable `w` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`w` is increased by 1, `n` is `n // 10`**
