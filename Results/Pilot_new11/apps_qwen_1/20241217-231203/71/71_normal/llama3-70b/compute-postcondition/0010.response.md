`n` is divided by 10 using floor division, which means the value of `n` is now `n // 10`. The value of `w` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 10 is still valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`w` is equal to its original value plus 1, `n` is now `n // 10` and must be greater than or equal to 1**
