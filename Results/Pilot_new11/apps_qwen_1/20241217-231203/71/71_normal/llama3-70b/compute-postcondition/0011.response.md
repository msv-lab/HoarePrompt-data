Output State: **`n` is `n // 10 ** w`, `w` is the original value of `w` plus the number of times the loop executed, and `n` is no longer divisible by \(10^k\)**

Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues to execute as long as `n % 10 ** k != 0`. Each iteration of the loop increments `w` by 1 and divides `n` by 10.
2. **Final State**: After the loop has executed, `n` will be the result of dividing the original `n` by \(10^w\), where `w` is the number of times the loop executed. Since the loop stops when `n` is divisible by \(10^k\), the final value of `n` will satisfy \(n \% 10^k = 0\).
3. **Variables**: 
   - `n`: The final value of `n` is `n // 10 ** w`, where `w` is the count of how many times the loop executed.
   - `w`: The value of `w` will be the original value plus the number of iterations the loop executed.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations is that `n` is `n // 10 ** w` and `w` is the original value of `w` plus the number of times the loop executed, with the condition that `n` is no longer divisible by \(10^k\).
