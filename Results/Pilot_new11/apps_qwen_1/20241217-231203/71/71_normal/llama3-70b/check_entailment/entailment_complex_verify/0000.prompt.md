You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the given number `n` ends with fewer than `k` trailing zeros. For example, consider the input:

- Input
  ```
  10203040 2
  ```

In this case, the program would incorrectly output `1`, but the correct answer should be `3` because we need to remove three digits (1, 2, and 3) to make the number divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). The program only checks if the last `k` digits form a number divisible by \(10^k\) and does not ensure that there are enough trailing zeros to achieve this.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and k, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 9. The integer n is provided as a non-negative integer, and k is a positive integer indicating the power of 10 by which the resulting number must be divisible.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is `n // 10
    print(w)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` (a non-negative integer where \(0 \leq n \leq 2,000,000,000\)) and `k` (a positive integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 9\)). It performs a series of operations to determine the number of times `n` needs to be divided by 10 until it becomes divisible by \(10^k\). After the loop, the function prints the count of divisions performed (`w`). The final state of the program is such that `n` is guaranteed to be divisible by \(10^k\), and the function does not return any value; instead, it prints the count of divisions required.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
