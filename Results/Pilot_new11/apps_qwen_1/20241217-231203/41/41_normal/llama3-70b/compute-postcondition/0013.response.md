The code appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. Initially, `ratings_before` is `[x, y]`. After appending `a`, `ratings_before` becomes `[x, y, a]`.

The values of `n`, `ratings_after`, and `a` are not specified in the initial state, so they are not included in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ratings_before` is [x, y, a], `ratings_after` is [y, x, y]**
