According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(i + 1, n)`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:

- `unrated` is `False`
- `i` and `n` are integers
- `n` is greater than `i`
- `j` is an integer with the current value of `j` being `i + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be within the specified range. Since `j` starts at `i + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j` must be `i + 2` (the next value in the range).

Given this, the new state should reflect that `j` has incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.

State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is an integer with the current value of `j` being `i + 2`**
