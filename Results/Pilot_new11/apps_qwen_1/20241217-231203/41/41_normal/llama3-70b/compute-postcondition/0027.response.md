The code `break` does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no loop or switch-case structure in the given initial state, the `break` statement here will not affect any variables. The Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `unrated` is False, `j` is 1**
