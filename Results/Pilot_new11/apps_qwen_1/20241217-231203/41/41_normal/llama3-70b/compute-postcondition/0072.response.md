Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `i` and `n` are integers with `n` greater than `i`, `j` is an integer starting from `i + 1`. After the loop completes, `unrated` remains `False` because for all `j` in the range, the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is never met.***
