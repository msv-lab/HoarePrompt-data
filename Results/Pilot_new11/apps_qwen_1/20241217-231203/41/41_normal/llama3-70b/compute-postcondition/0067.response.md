The `break` statement does not modify any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. The `unrated` variable is still `False`, `i` and `n` retain their original integer values, and `j` remains `i + 3`.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is an integer, `n` is an integer and `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is `i + 3`**
