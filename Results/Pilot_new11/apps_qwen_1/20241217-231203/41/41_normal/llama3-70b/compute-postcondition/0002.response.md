The code `ratings_after = []` initializes an empty list for `ratings_after`. The initial state is that `n` is an input integer representing the number of participants, and `ratings_before` is an empty list. After executing the code, `ratings_after` becomes an empty list, while `n` and `ratings_before` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of participants; `ratings_before` is an empty list; `ratings_after` is an empty list**
