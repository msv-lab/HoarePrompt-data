`ratings_before` is appended with the value of `a`. Since `a` is an integer from input, its specific value is unknown at this point, but we know that `ratings_before` now contains `a`. The other variables (`n`, `ratings_after`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ratings_before` is a list containing `a`, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
