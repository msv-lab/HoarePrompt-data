Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `i + 1` to `n` (exclusive).

2. **Initial States Given:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Determine Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop `for j in range(i + 1, n)` to execute, the range `(i + 1, n)` must be valid.
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop becomes `for j in range(1, n)`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 (because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
