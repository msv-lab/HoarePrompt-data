The code `print('maybe')` does not affect any variable values; it only prints the string 'maybe' to the console. The initial state of `unrated` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False` because for all indices `i`, `ratings_before[i] < ratings_after[i]`, and `unrated` is a boolean value**
