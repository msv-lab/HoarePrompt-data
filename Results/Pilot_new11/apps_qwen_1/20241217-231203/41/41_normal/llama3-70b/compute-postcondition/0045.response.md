The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `unrated`. It simply breaks out of the innermost loop or loop-like construct. Since there is no loop or loop-like construct in the given initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `unrated` is False**
