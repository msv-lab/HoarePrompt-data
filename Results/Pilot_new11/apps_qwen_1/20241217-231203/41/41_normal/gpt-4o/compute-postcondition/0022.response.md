State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`. The `ratings` list remains an empty list if the loop did not execute at all, otherwise, it contains tuples with distinct integers `a` and `b`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `for i in range(1, n)` means the loop will start from `i = 1` and continue until `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts from 1).

2. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not run at all.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `ratings` is initially an empty list.
   - `is_rated` is `False`.
   - `is_unrated` is `True`.

4. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider what changes might occur inside the loop. Since the loop body is not provided, we cannot specify exact changes, but we can infer that the loop might add tuples to the `ratings` list and potentially change the values of `is_rated` and `is_unrated`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `ratings` must be an empty list since no ratings have been added yet.
- `is_rated` is `False` and `is_unrated` is `True` because no ratings have been processed yet.

Therefore, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`**
