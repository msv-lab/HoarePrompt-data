Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b), `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `True`. If the loop does not execute, `ratings` remains an empty list. If the loop executes, `i` will be `n`, and the condition `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` will never be met during the loop iterations.***
