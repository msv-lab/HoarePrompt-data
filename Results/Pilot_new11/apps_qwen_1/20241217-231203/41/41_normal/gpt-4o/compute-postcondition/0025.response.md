The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement before the `break`, it simply exits the hypothetical loop or conditional block it was inside. The variables `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, `is_unrated`, and the condition about the ratings list do not change their values because the `break` statement does not modify them.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, the current value of `i` satisfies that the rating at index `i-1` is less than the rating at index `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
