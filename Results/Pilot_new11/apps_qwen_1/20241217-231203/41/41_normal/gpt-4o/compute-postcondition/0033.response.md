The code `break` does not affect any variable values but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Given the initial state, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
