Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a, b)`, `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`. For every tuple in `ratings`, `a` and `b` are distinct integers unless the loop did not execute at all, in which case `ratings` remains an empty list and `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remain their original values.**
