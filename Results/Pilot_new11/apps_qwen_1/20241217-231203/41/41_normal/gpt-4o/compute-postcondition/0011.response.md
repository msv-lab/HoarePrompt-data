`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input will provide two integers, one for `a` and one for `b`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, `is_unrated`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ratings` is ['a', 'b'], `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
