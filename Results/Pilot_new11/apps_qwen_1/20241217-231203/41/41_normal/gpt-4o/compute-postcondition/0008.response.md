`is_rated` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ratings` is ['a', 'b'], `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, and `a` is not equal to `b`.
