The variable `is_unrated` is set to `True`. The value of `is_unrated` was previously `True`, and since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, the current value of `i` satisfies that the rating at index `i-1` is less than the rating at index `i`**
