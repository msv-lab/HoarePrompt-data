The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This affects the values of `a` and `b`, which were previously just integers from input. The states of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged.

Since `a` and `b` are now assigned the values from the input, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ratings` remains as `['a', 'b', (a, b)]`, `is_rated` is `True`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` and `b` are integers from input**.
