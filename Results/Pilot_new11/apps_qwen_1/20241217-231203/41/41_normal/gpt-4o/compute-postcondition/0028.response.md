The code `is_unrated = True` does not change the value of `is_unrated`. It simply reassigns `is_unrated` to `True`, which was already its value in the initial state. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 2**
