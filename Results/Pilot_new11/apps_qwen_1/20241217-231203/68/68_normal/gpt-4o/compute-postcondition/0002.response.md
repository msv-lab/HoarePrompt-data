The code assigns the value of `x + z` to the variable `max_upvotes`. Since `x` and `z` are integers entered by the user and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, the value of `max_upvotes` will be `x + z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`**.
