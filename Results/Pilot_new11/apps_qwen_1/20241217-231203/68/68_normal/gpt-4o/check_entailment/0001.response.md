Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not consider the scenario where the number of unknown votes (`z`) could lead to multiple possible outcomes, even if the current range of upvotes and downvotes do not immediately determine the result.

For example, consider the input `1 1 1`:
- Here, `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`.
- The minimum number of upvotes is `1` (if no unknown votes upvote).
- The maximum number of upvotes is `2` (if all unknown votes upvote).
- The minimum number of downvotes is `1` (if no unknown votes downvote).
- The maximum number of downvotes is `2` (if all unknown votes downvote).

In this case, both the maximum number of upvotes (`2`) and the maximum number of downvotes (`2`) could be achieved, making the result uncertain because changing the unknown votes' behavior could change the outcome. However, the current program incorrectly prints `0` instead of `?`.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if the ranges overlap in such a way that the result remains uncertain.
