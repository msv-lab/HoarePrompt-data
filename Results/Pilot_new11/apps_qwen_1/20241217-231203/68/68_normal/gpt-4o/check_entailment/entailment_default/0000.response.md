Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the given inputs \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The conditions for determining the output are accurately implemented:

- If the maximum possible upvotes (\(x + z\)) are less than the minimum possible downvotes (\(y\)), the result is \(-\).
- If the maximum possible downvotes (\(y + z\)) are less than the minimum possible upvotes (\(x\)), the result is \(+\).
- Otherwise, the result is uncertain, and the program prints `?`.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, as demonstrated by the provided examples and the logic within the function. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
