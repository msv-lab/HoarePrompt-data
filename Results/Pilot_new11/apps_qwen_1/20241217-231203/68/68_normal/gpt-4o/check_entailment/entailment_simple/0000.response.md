Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `min_upvotes` is initialized to \(x\).
   - `max_upvotes` is set to \(x + z\).
   - `min_downvotes` is initialized to \(y\).
   - `max_downvotes` is set to \(y + z\).

3. **Result Determination**:
   - The program checks if the maximum possible number of upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible number of downvotes (`min_downvotes`). If this condition holds, it means that even if all unknown votes go against the upvotes, the upvotes still cannot exceed the downvotes. Hence, the result is `"-"`.
   - If the above condition does not hold, the program further checks if the maximum possible number of downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible number of upvotes (`min_upvotes`). If this condition holds, it means that even if all unknown votes go in favor of the upvotes, the upvotes will still exceed the downvotes. Hence, the result is `"+"`.
   - If neither of the above conditions hold, it means that the result can be either `"+"`, `"-"`, or `"0"`, depending on how the unknown votes are distributed. In this case, the result is `"?"`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\), ensuring that the output is correct for the given examples.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the appropriate result based on the logic described in the problem statement.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine the voting result or report uncertainty based on the input values \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
