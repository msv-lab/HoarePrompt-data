Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly handles all the given scenarios as described in the problem statement and the output hints. Specifically:

1. **Case \( x > y + z \):** The program prints `+`, which is correct.
2. **Case \( x < y \):** The program prints `-`, which is correct.
3. **Case \( x == y \) and \( z == 0 \):** The program prints `0`, which is correct.
4. **Case \( x == y \) and \( z != 0 \):** The program prints `?`, which is correct.
5. **All other cases:** The program correctly handles these by printing `?`, indicating uncertainty.

Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints confirm its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.
