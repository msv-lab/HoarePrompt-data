Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Case \( x > y + z \):**
   - The program prints `+` which is correct because having more upvotes than downvotes and unknown votes ensures a positive result.

2. **Case \( x < y \):**
   - The program prints `-` which is correct because having more downvotes than upvotes and unknown votes ensures a negative result.

3. **Case \( x = y \):**
   - If \( z = 0 \), the program prints `0`, which is correct because the equal number of upvotes and downvotes with no unknown votes ensures a neutral result.
   - If \( z > 0 \), the program prints `?`, which is correct because an unknown vote can change the result from `0` to either `+` or `-`.

4. **Case \( x \leq y + z \) and \( x \geq y \):**
   - In this case, the program prints `?`, which is correct because the unknown votes could potentially tip the balance between `+` and `-`.

Since the program correctly handles all these scenarios without any errors or omissions, the program is correct.
