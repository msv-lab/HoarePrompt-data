Correctness: False

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \(x < y\) correctly. According to the problem description, if \(x < y\), the program should print '-'. However, the provided code does not cover this case properly. Instead, it has an else block that prints '?' for certain conditions, which is incorrect. 

For example, consider the following input:
- \(x = 5\)
- \(y = 6\)
- \(z = 0\)

According to the problem description, the correct output should be '-'. However, the current implementation does not handle this case, leading to an incorrect output.
