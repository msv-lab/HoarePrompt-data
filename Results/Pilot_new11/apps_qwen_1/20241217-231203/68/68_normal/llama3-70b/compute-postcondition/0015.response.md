Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, and both `x` and `y + z` satisfy the condition `x >= y`. If `x == y` and `z == 0`, then the string '0' is printed. If `x == y` and `z != 0`, then a question mark is printed. If `x > y`, then no specific action is performed other than maintaining the conditions `0 <= x, y, z <= 100` and `x > y`.***
