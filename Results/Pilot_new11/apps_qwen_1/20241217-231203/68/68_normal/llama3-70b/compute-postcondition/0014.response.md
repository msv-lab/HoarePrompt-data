The code `print('?')` does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. It simply prints a question mark to the console. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **x is an integer, y is an integer, z is an integer, and both x and y + z satisfy the condition x > y, and all values are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
