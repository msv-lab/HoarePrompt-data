Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Although the provided solution handles most cases correctly, it still has a logical flaw. The function `func_1` does not explicitly handle the case where the entire screen is filled with '.', meaning there are no 'w' pixels. In such a case, the function should return -1, but it incorrectly processes the input and returns a 2D list with '+' characters, which violates the problem description. The annotated version highlights this issue, confirming that the function should return -1 when no 'w' pixels are found, rather than attempting to construct a frame. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is accurate.
