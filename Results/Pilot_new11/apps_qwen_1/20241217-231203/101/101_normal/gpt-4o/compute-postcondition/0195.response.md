The code `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `+` to the element in the 2D list `result` at position `[i][j]`. Based on the initial state, `i` is `bottom + 1` and `j` is `left + 1`. The other variables (`result`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`result` is a 2D list with boundary elements marked with `+`, `i` is `bottom + 1`, `j` is `left + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`; the element `result[i][j]` is marked with `+`.**
