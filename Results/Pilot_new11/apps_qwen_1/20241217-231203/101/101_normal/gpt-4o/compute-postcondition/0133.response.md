The code sets `left` and `right` both to the value of `j`. The initial value of `j` is `0`, so both `left` and `right` are updated to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `0`, `right` is `0`**
