Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`. If `screen[i][j]` is not `'w'`, the values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is `'w'`, then `left` and `right` are adjusted based on the position of `j` relative to `left` and `right`: if `j > right`, then `left` is set to `j` and `right` remains unchanged; if `j < left`, then `right` is set to `j` and `left` remains unchanged; otherwise, the values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.***
