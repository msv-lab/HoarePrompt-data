The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n-1` based on the initial state. The values of `top` and `right` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `right` retains its original value, and `bottom` is `n-1`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `right` retains its original value, and `bottom` is `n-1`.**
