Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
   - `screen` is a 2D list of characters.
   - `i` remains the same as from the previous iteration.
   - `j` is `j + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range `range(m)`. Therefore, the loop will continue if `j` is less than `m`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - **j Value**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 again.
   - **top, bottom, left, right Values**: These values depend on the conditions inside the loop.

4. **Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is `None`, then:
     - `top` is set to `i`.
     - `bottom` is set to `i`.
     - `left` is set to `j`.
     - `right` is set to `j`.
   - Otherwise:
     - If `i < top`, then `top` remains unchanged.
     - `bottom` is set to `i`.
     - If `j < left`, then `left` remains unchanged.
     - `right` is set to `j` if `j > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged.

5. **Next Iteration State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `j` will be `j + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will retain their values from the previous iteration unless they were updated inside the loop based on the condition that `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.

Given this information, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j + 2`, `top` retains its value from the previous iteration, `bottom` retains its value from the previous iteration, `left` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `right` retains its value from the previous iteration unless it was updated inside the loop.**

However, since we don't have the exact values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` from the previous iteration, we can only express them as retaining their previous values or updating based on the condition if `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration can be expressed as:
State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j + 2`, `top` retains its value from the previous iteration, `bottom` retains its value from the previous iteration, `left` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `right` retains its value from the previous iteration unless it was updated inside the loop.**
