The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is less than `left`, so when `left` is updated to `j`, `left` becomes less than its original value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `bottom` is equal to `i` if `i > bottom`. Otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged, and `left` is equal to `j`.**
