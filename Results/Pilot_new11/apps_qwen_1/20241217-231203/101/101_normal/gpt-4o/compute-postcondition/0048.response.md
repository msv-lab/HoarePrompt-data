Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** The loop starts with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and `j` ranging from `0` to `m-1`. The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are initially set to `None`.
- **Loop Execution:** As the loop iterates over each element in the `screen` matrix, if a 'w' pixel is encountered, the loop updates the boundaries:
  - If `top` is `None`, it initializes `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to the current row and column indices.
  - If the current row index `i` is less than `top`, it updates `top` to `i`.
  - If the current row index `i` is greater than `bottom`, it updates `bottom` to `i`.
  - If the current column index `j` is less than `left`, it updates `left` to `j`.
  - If the current column index `j` is greater than `right`, it updates `right` to `j`.
- **Final Values:** After the loop completes, `top` and `bottom` will hold the smallest and largest row indices containing a 'w' pixel, respectively. Similarly, `left` and `right` will hold the smallest and largest column indices containing a 'w' pixel, respectively. The indices `i` and `j` will be `n-1` and `m-1`, respectively, because the loop iterates through each element in the matrix.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., no 'w' pixels are present in the `screen` matrix), the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will remain `None`, and `i` and `j` will also be `n-1` and `m-1`, respectively. However, this scenario is unlikely given the initial condition that there is at least one 'w' pixel in the `screen`.
