Postcondition: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is set to `n-1`, `left` and `right` are set to the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels if there is at least one 'w' pixel, otherwise `top` and `bottom` are `None` and `left` and `right` are `m-1`, and `m` must be greater than 0. The final value of `i` is either `n-1` (if it was originally greater than `bottom`) or retains its original value (if it was originally less than or equal to `bottom`). If `j > right`, `i` remains unchanged; otherwise, no change is applied to `i`.**
