The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is used to update `bottom`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j+1`, `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is now `i`, `left` is the same, and `right` is the same if `screen[i][j+1]` is 'w' and `j+1 > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged.**
