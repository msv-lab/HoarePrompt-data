The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given that `i` is initially `n-1`, the value of `bottom` will also be `n-1`. The other variables (`screen`, `i`, `top`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`, `bottom` is `n-1**.
