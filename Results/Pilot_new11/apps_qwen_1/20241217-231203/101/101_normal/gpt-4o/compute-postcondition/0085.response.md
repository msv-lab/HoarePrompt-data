The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial value of `j` is `m-1`. The variables `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, and `right` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `right` retains its original value from the precondition, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`**
