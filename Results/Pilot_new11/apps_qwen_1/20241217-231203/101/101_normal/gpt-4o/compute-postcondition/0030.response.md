Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j+1`, `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is now `i`, `left` is `j` if `j < left`, otherwise `left` remains unchanged, and `right` is the same if `screen[i][j+1]` is 'w' and `j+1 > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged.***
