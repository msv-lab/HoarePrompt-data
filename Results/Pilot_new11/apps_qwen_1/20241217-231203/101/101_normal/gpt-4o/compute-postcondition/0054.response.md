The code sets `left` and `right` both to the value of `j`. The value of `j` is `m-1`, so both `left` and `right` are now `m-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
