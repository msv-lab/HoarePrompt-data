Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `right` is either `m-1` or `m-2` (depending on the condition `i > bottom`), `top` is `n-1`. If `i > bottom`, the condition is met and no further changes are made to the variables. Since there is no else part, the variables retain their original values as specified in the precondition.***
