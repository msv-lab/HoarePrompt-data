Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for j in range(left, right + 1)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[left, right]`.

2. **Understand the Variables Involved**:
   - `result`: A 2D list where boundary elements are marked with `+`.
   - `i`: Given as `bottom + 1`.
   - `j`: This is the variable that iterates over the specified range.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**:
   - The loop starts with `j = left`. Therefore, for the loop to start executing, `j` must be equal to `left`.

4. **Determine the Range of `j`**:
   - The loop will continue until `j` reaches `right + 1`. However, since `range` is exclusive of the upper bound, the loop will stop when `j` is equal to `right`.

5. **Ensure the Range is Valid**:
   - For the loop to execute at all, the range `[left, right]` must be valid. This means `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

6. **Initial State of the 2D List (`result`)**:
   - Since the boundary elements are already marked with `+`, we don't need to adjust this state directly. However, we should ensure that the dimensions of the list are sufficient to include these boundaries.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments to the initial state are:

- `i` should be `bottom + 1`.
- `j` should start at `left`.
- The range `[left, right]` must be valid (i.e., `left` â‰¤ `right`).

State: **`result` is a 2D list with boundary elements marked with `+`, `i` is `bottom + 1`, `j` is `left`, and `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.**
