The code assigns the same value to both `left` and `right`, which is the current value of `j`. The previous values of `left` and `right` are `m-1`, but now they are both set to `j`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`**
