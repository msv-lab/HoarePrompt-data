The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial state indicates that `j` is `j + 2`, but since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we'll keep it as `j + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j + 2`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j + 2`, `right` is `j + 2`.**
