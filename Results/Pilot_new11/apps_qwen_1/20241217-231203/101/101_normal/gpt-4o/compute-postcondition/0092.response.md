The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to `right`. The initial state indicates that `j` is `m-1`. The values of `i`, `j`, `left`, `top`, and `right` are updated as follows:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-1`
- `left` retains its original value from the precondition
- `top` retains its original value from the precondition
- `right` is now `j`, which is `m-1`

Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `left` retains its original value, `top` retains its original value, and `right` is `m-1`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `left` retains its original value, `top` retains its original value, `right` is `m-1**
