Postcondition: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` and `right` are both `m-1`. If `top` is `None`, then `left` is `j` and `right` is `j`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, the coordinates do not change. Otherwise, the coordinates remain as they were initially.**
