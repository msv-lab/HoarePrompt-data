Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
   - `j` is `left + 1`.
   - The condition for updating `result[i][j]` is if `i` equals `top` or `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, and `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, then `result[i][j]` is set to `'+'`. Otherwise, the state of `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(left, right + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `j` being `left + 1`.
   - The loop will iterate over `j` from `left + 1` to `right`.

4. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `[left, right]`.
   - After each iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `j` starts at `left + 1`, the first value of `j` in the next iteration will be `left + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be within the range `[left, right]`.
   - Therefore, `j` must not exceed `right`.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `left` and `right` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
   - `j` will be updated to `left + 2` for the next iteration.
   - The condition for updating `result[i][j]` remains the same.

**Final State:**
State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `left + 2`, and if `i` equals `top` or `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, and `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, then `result[i][j]` is set to `'+'`. Otherwise, the state of `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
