The code assigns the value `+` to `result[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `j` is equal to `left`, and `result[i][j]` is initially equal to `'.'`. After the assignment, `result[i][j]` will be `+`. The other conditions and the value of `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `left`, `result[i][j]` is `+`, `j` is equal to `left`, `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`.**
