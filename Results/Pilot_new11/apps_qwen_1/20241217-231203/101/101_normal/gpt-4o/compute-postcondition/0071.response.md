The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n-1`, `top` and `bottom` are both set to `n-1`. The values of `j`, `right`, `screen`, `i`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `top` is `n-1`
- `bottom` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-2`
- `right` is either `m-1` or `m-2` depending on the condition
- `screen` is a 2D list of characters
- `i` is `n-1`

Output State: **`top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `right` is either `m-1` or `m-2` depending on the condition, `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1**
