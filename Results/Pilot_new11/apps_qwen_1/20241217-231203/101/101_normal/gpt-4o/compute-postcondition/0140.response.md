The value of `right` is updated to `j`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `top` retains its original value (`n-1`), `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `j` if `j < left`, and `right` is now `j`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `j` if `j < left`, and `right` is `j`.**
