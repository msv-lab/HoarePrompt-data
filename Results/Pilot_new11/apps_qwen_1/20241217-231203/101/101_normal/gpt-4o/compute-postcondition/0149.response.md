The code `frame_height = bottom - top + 1` calculates the height of the frame by subtracting the minimum row index (`top`) from the maximum row index (`bottom`) where there is a 'w' pixel and adds 1. This value is then assigned to the variable `frame_height`. The other variables (`screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.**
