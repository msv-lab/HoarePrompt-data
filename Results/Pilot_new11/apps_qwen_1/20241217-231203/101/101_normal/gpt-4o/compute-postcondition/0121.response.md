`top` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n-1`, so `top` becomes `n-1`. The values of the other variables (`screen`, `j`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`**
