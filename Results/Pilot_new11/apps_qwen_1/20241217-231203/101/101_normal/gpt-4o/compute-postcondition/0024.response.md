The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial values of `left` and `right` are set to `i` and `j+1` based on the condition `screen[i][j+1]` being 'w' and `j+1 > right`. Since this assignment directly updates `left` and `right` to `j`, the conditions for setting them to `i` and `j+1` are no longer relevant.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `left` is now `j`
- `right` is now `j`

The states of the other variables (`screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j+1`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`.**
