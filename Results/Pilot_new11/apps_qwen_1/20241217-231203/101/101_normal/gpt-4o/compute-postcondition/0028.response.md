Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j+1`, `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is now `i`, `left` is the same, and `right` is the same if `screen[i][j+1]` is 'w' and `j+1 > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged.***

Explanation:
- The if part sets `bottom` to `i` when `i > bottom`.
- Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition simply reflects the change made in the if part.
