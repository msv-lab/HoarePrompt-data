The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is now stored in `bottom`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `bottom` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `bottom` is equal to `i`**
