Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `screen` is a 2D list of characters.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `m-1`.
   - `top` retains its original value.
   - `bottom` is `n-1`.
   - `left` and `right` are both `m-1`.
   - If `top` is `None`, then `left` is `j` and `right` is `j`.
   - Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, the coordinates do not change. Otherwise, the coordinates remain as they were initially.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - Since we are currently at `j = m-1`, the next iteration would be for `j = 0`.

4. **Considering the Conditions:**
   - `top` retains its original value.
   - `bottom` is still `n-1`.
   - `left` and `right` are still `m-1` (since `j` did not change from `m-1`).

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `j` will be updated to `0` for the next iteration.
   - All other states (`screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged because the loop condition does not affect these variables directly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `0`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`**
