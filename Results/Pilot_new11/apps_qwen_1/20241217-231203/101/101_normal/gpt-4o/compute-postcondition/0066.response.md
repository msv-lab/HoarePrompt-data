The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `right`. In the initial state, `right` remains unchanged unless explicitly assigned a new value. Since `right` is not given a specific value in the initial state, it retains its original value from the previous context. The value of `j` is used to update `right`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is not None, `bottom` remains unchanged, `right` is now `j`, and `left` remains unchanged.**
