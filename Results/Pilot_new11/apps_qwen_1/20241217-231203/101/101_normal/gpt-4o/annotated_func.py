    return result
    #`The program returns the 2D list 'result' where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows 'top' and 'bottom' and columns 'left' and 'right') are marked with '+'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2000, and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each containing exactly `m` characters. These characters are either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), and at least one 'w' exists in the `screen`.

The function first identifies the bounding box of the white pixels ('w') in the `screen` by finding the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost positions of 'w'. If no 'w' is found, it returns -1. If the bounding box has a height or width less than 2, it also returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a copy of the `screen` and marks all the boundary elements of the bounding box with '+'.

Thus, the final state of the program after executing `func_1` is one of the following:
- The program returns -1 if no 'w' is found or if the bounding box has a height or width less than 2.
- The program returns a 2D list `result` where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with '+'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the program returns -1 in multiple cases, but the actual code only includes one return statement within the `if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None)` block. This implies that if the bounding box dimensions are less than 2, the function should also return -1, which is already covered in the second condition check.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the entire `screen` is filled with '.'. In this case, the function would still find the bounding box but would return -1 because the width or height would be less than 2.
