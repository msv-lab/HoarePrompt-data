The code snippet changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'+'.` The variables `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, and `i` are not directly affected by this line of code. The values of `n` and `m` are also not changed. However, the condition involving `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` might affect whether this assignment actually happens, but since no specific coordinates are given, we cannot determine if this condition is met or not without additional context.

Therefore, the only change is to the `pixels` list at the specific coordinates `(i, j)`. Since the exact coordinates are not specified, we cannot give a more detailed output state.

Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, and the pixel at position `(i, j)` in `pixels` is now `'+'`.**
