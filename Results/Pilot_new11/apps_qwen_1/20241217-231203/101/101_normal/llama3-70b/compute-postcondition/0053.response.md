Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` must be the same as before.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m-1`.
   - At the end of each iteration, `j` increases by 1.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the range `[0, m-1]`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was either `min_y` or `max_y`.
   - Since `j` starts at `min_y` or `max_y` and increments by 1 each time, the next value of `j` will be `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be within the range `[0, m-1]`.

6. **Determine the New Value of `j`:**
   - If `j` was `min_y` initially, the next value of `j` will be `min_y + 1`.
   - If `j` was `max_y` initially, the next value of `j` will be `max_y + 1`.

7. **Ensure the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `j` must remain within the range `[0, m-1]`.

8. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` remains `n` (unchanged).
   - `n` remains the same as before.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged).
   - `j` becomes `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`, depending on the initial value of `j`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `min_y + 1` or `max_y + 1`.**
