According to the given information, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `j` is 1
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the same as before
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `j < m`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The loop starts with `j = 0`.
2. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
4. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m`.

Given this, `j` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.

So, the updated states will be:
- `j` will be 2
- `i` remains `n - 1`
- `n` remains the same as before
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 2

State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
