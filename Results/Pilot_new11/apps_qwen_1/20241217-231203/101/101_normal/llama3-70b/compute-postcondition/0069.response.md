The code changes the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` from `'.'` to `'+'`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is '+', and either `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`**
