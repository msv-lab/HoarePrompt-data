The `continue` statement in Python does not change the values of any variables; it only skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and goes to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified and the initial conditions are not altered, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`.**
