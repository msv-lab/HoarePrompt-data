`pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `+`. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, and the value of `j` is 2. The value of `m` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `pixels[i][j]` is '+'**
