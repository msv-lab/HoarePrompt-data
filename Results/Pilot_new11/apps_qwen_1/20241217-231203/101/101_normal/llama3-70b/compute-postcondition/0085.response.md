The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
