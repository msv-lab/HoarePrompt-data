Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is either '+' or 'w'. If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y` and `pixels[i][j]` is '+', the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the condition remains unchanged as well.***
