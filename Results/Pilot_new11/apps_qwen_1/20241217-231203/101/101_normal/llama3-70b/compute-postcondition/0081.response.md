Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', the pixel at that position is changed to '.'.***
