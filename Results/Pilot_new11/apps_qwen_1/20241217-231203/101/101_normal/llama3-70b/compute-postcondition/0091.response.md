To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and the current state:

### Current State Before the Loop:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the same as before
- `m` is the same as before
- `pixels[i][j]` for all `i` and `j` is either `'+', 'w',` or `'. '` based on certain conditions.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
The loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` list. Therefore, the loop will execute if `pixels` is a non-empty list containing rows.

### Analysis:
1. **Pixels List**: The loop will iterate over each row in `pixels`. For the loop to execute, `pixels` must be a non-empty list (i.e., it must contain at least one row).
2. **Rows in Pixels**: Since the loop iterates over `row` in `pixels`, there must be at least one row in `pixels`.

### Adjusted States:
- Ensure `pixels` is a non-empty list (i.e., `pixels` must have at least one row).

Given that `i` is already set to `n`, this doesn't directly impact the loop execution but rather indicates the starting point for `i` within the loop. Similarly, `n` and `m` being the same as before do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

### Conclusion:
State: **`pixels` must be a non-empty list (at least one row), and `i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is the same as before, `pixels[i][j]` for all `i` and `j` is either `'+', 'w',` or `'. '` based on the given conditions.**

Thus, the primary adjustment needed is to ensure `pixels` is a non-empty list.
