Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and either (`i` is not equal to `min_x` and `i` is not equal to `max_x` and `j` is not equal to `min_y` and `j` is not equal to `max_y`) or `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w'. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged as well.***
