According to the code, the loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `pixels` is a non-empty list with at least two rows, `i` is 0, and the first row of `pixels` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. The variable `i` will increment by 1, so it will become `i = 1`.
2. The loop will then proceed to the second row of the `pixels` list.

Since the loop is iterating over each row, and we know that `pixels` is a non-empty list with at least two rows, the condition for the next iteration will still be satisfied as long as there are more rows in the list after the first row.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- The next row in the `pixels` list will be processed.

State: **`pixels` must be a non-empty list with at least two rows, `i` is 1, `m` is the same as before, and the second row of `pixels` is processed.**
