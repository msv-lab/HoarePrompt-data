The code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum of their current values and `x` and `y` respectively. Since the initial state includes that `min_x` is the minimum of its current value and `x`, and `min_y` is the minimum of its current value and `y`, these variables are not directly affected by the code snippet. The output state will reflect the updated values of `max_x` and `max_y`.

Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the minimum of its current value and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of its current value and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of its current value and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of its current value and `y`.**
