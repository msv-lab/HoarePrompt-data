The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y`. Initially, `min_x` is the minimum of its current value and `x`, and `min_y` is the minimum of its current value and `y`. After running the code, `min_x` will be the minimum of `min_x` and `x`, and `min_y` will be the minimum of `min_y` and `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the minimum of `min_x` and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of `min_y` and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of its current value and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of its current value and `y`**
