Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is '.', and either `i` is `min_x` or `i` is `max_x` or `j` is `min_y` or `j` is `max_y`, then `m` is increased by 1. If the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is '+', `m` remains unchanged. If the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the pixel at position `pixels[i][j]` is changed to '.'.**
