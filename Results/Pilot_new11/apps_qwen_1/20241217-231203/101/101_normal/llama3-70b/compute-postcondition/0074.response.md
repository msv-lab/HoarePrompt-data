The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`. Given the conditions in the initial state, the values of `j`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `pixels` are updated as follows:

- `j` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the same as before
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- Either `i` is not equal to `min_x` and `i` is not equal to `max_x` and `j` is not equal to `min_y` and `j` is not equal to `max_y` or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to `'.'`.

Since the only change is that `pixels[i][j]` is now `'.'`, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and either (i is not equal to `min_x` and i is not equal to `max_x` and j is not equal to `min_y` and j is not equal to `max_y`) or `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`.**
