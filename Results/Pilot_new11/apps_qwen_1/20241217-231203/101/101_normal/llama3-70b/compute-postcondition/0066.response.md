According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` is the same as before
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will not execute again unless `i` is decreased.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to decrease `i` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Also, the condition `m` being greater than or equal to 1 does not affect the loop execution directly but is kept as it is.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
