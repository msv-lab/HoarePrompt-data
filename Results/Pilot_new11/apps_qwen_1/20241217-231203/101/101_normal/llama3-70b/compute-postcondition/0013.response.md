Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Initially, `min_x` is set to `float('inf')` and `min_y` is set to `float('inf')`. This means they start as the highest possible values, ensuring any actual `x` and `y` values will be smaller.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each iteration of the loop, the coordinates `(x, y)` of the `'w'` pixel are used to update `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`:
   - `min_x` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and `x`.
   - `min_y` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and `y`.
   - `max_x` is updated to be the larger of its current value and `x`.
   - `max_y` is updated to be the larger of its current value and `y`.
3. **Final Values**: After all iterations of the loop (if `white_pixels` is not empty), `min_x` and `min_y` will hold the smallest `x` and `y` coordinates of all `'w'` pixels, while `max_x` and `max_y` will hold the largest `x` and `y` coordinates of all `'w'` pixels.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: If `white_pixels` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` will retain their initial values (`float('inf')` for `min_x` and `min_y`, and `float('-inf')` for `max_x` and `max_y`).

Thus, the final output state reflects the overall bounds of all `'w'` pixels in the grid.
