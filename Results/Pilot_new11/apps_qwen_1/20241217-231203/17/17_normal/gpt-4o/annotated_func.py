#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, where each line contains one integer \(cnt_i\) (\(0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9\)) representing the count of strings with specific forms: \(cnt_1\) strings "(((...)", \(cnt_2\) strings "()()...", \(cnt_3\) strings "()(...", and \(cnt_4\) strings "...))".
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if (cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3) :
        print(1)
    else :
        print(0)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is the value of `int(input())`, and `cnt4` is the new input integer. If the condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` and `cnt2 >= cnt3` is satisfied, the function prints 1. Otherwise, the condition `cnt1 + cnt2 != cnt3 + cnt4` or `cnt2 < cnt3` holds true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes four integers representing counts of specific forms of strings and determines whether a certain condition is met. Specifically, it checks if the sum of counts of strings "(((...)" and "()()..." equals the sum of counts of strings "()(..." and "...))", and if the count of strings "()()..." is greater than or equal to the count of strings "()(...)". If both conditions are satisfied, the function prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not return anything explicitly but outputs the result directly. Potential edge cases include when the inputs do not satisfy the specified constraints (e.g., negative values or values exceeding \(10^9\)), in which case the function still operates within its defined behavior.
