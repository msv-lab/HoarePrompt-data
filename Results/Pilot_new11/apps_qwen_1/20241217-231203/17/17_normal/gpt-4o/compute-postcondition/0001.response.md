`cnt2` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `cnt1` remains unchanged, and the values of `cnt3` and `cnt4` remain the same as their initial state.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is the original integer, `cnt4` is the original integer**
