Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program only checks integer coordinates for the heat source, whereas the problem description specifies that the coordinates \(X\) and \(Y\) are real numbers. The function `func_3` iterates over all possible integer values of \(x\) and \(y\) within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), which means it will not find the optimal solution if the optimal coordinates are not integers. 

To meet the problem description correctly, the program should consider real-number coordinates for the heat source, not just integer coordinates. The annotated version confirms that the program does not handle the requirement for real-number coordinates, thus the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is maintained.
