Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program only considers integer coordinates for the heat source, which is insufficient given the problem constraints that allow for real number coordinates. The sample input demonstrates that the optimal solution might not be at an integer coordinate, as the optimal point for placing the heat source is \((-0.2, 0)\). Therefore, the program cannot guarantee finding the minimum time required to grill \(K\) or more pieces of meat because it does not explore all possible real number coordinates.
