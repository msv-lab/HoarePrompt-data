The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with `x` and `y` as arguments, but the actual implementation of `func_2` is not provided. Since we don't know what `func_2` does, we cannot determine the exact value of `times`. However, the initial state of `x` and `y` remains unchanged because `func_2` is called but no assignment to `x` or `y` is made within the given code snippet. 

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`; `y` must iterate through the range \([-1000, 1000]\); `ans` is the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all times lists generated during the loop iterations; `times` is the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.**
