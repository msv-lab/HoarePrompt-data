Let's analyze the given for loop step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration.

### Given Loop Code
```python
for x in range(-1000, 1001):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- The loop is iterating over `x` from \(-1000\) to \(1000\).
- We need to determine the state of `x` at the end of the previous iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Value of `x`:**
   - The loop starts with `x = -1000`.
   - The loop increments `x` by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Previous Iteration:**
   - If we assume that the loop has just completed its previous iteration, `x` would have been incremented by 1 from its value at the start of the previous iteration.
   - If the loop started with `x = -1000`, the previous iteration would have had `x = -999`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - In the current iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `x` will now be `x = -999`.

### Conclusion
- `x` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- The loop will continue to iterate over the range \([-1000, 1000]\).

### Updated State
- `x` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so it will be \(-999\) at the start of the next iteration.
- The other variables (if any) are not specified, so we assume they remain unchanged or are not relevant for this specific question.

### Output State
State: **`x` is \(-999`**.

This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be \(-999\).

**Final Output State:**
```
x is -999
```
