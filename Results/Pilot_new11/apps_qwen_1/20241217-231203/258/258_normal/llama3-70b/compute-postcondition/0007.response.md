The function `func_2` is called with arguments `x, y, x, y`. However, the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values that `times` will take. We only know that `times` is expected to be a sorted list of two integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).

The `times` list is updated, so the previous values of `times` are no longer relevant. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `y` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 999]\), `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `ans` is the minimum between the current value of `ans` and `times[1]`**
