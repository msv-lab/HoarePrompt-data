The `times.sort()` line sorts the `times` list in ascending order. Since the initial value of `x` is dependent on `x_current` (either `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000` or `-1000`), and `y` and `ans` are independent of `times`, their values do not change. However, the sorting operation changes the order of elements in the `times` list.

Let's assume the initial value of `times` is not specified, so we will keep it as `times` for now, and note that it gets sorted.

Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`; `y` is `-997`; `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`; `times` is sorted in ascending order.**
