The code assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `times[K - 1]` to `ans`. Given the initial state where `K` is not explicitly defined but can be inferred from the list `times` which has two elements `-1000` and `-999`, `K - 1` would refer to the index `0` since indexing starts at `0`.

So, `times[K - 1]` is `-1000`. The current value of `ans` is `-999`. The minimum value between `-999` and `-1000` is `-1000`.

Therefore, `ans` is updated to `-1000`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `times` is [-1000, -999], `ans` is -1000**
