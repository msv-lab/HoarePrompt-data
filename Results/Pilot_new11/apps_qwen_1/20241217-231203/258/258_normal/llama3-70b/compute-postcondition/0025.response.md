The code assigns the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided initial state or code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `times` without knowing the implementation of `func_2`. 

Given the initial state:
- `x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`
- `y` is `-997`
- `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`

Since the function `func_2` is not defined, we cannot calculate the exact value of `times`. Thus, the values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`; `y` is `-997`; `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`**
