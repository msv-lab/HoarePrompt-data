The code snippet provided updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `ans`, nor does it provide the value of `K` or the list `times`, which is the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. Since the value of `x` is given as `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`, and `y` is explicitly given as `-998`, we can proceed with these values.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`
- `y` is `-998`
- `times` is sorted and equals to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`

Let's assume `func_2(x, y, x, y)` returns a list `times`. Since the exact list `times` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `times[K - 1]`. However, we know that `times` is sorted.

The code snippet does not change the values of `x` or `y`, but it updates `ans` based on the value of `times[K - 1]`. Without knowing the value of `K` or the contents of `times`, we cannot specify the exact updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`; `y` is `-998`; `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`**
