The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times`. Since `times` is already sorted and equals to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, the sort operation does not change the list because it is already sorted. The values of `x`, `y`, and `times` remain the same as they were before the sort operation.

From the initial state:
- `x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`.
- `y` is \(-998\).
- `times` is sorted and equals to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

Since sorting a sorted list does not change its elements, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`; `y` is \(-998\); `times` is sorted and equals to the return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**
