Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000
- `times` is a sorted list containing [-999, `y`]
- `ans` is -999

### For Loop:
```
for y in range(-1000, 1001):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs over the range from -1000 to 1000 inclusive. Therefore, the loop condition is based on the variable `y`.

2. **Current State of `y`**:
   - Since `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000, it means `y` can take any value in this range.
   - After the previous iteration, `y` was one of these values.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be the next value in the range.
   - Since the loop is iterating over a range, the next value of `y` would be the current value of `y` + 1 (if `y` is not the maximum value in the range).

### Adjusted States:
- `x` remains unchanged at -999.
- `y` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `times` will still contain [-999, `y`], but `y` will be updated.
- `ans` remains unchanged at -999.

### Updated State:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is now `y + 1` (since the loop will continue if `y` is within the range)
- `times` is still a sorted list containing [-999, `y`], but `y` is updated.
- `ans` remains -999

### Final State:
State: **`x` is -999, `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000 and is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `times` is a sorted list containing [-999, `y`], `ans` is -999**
