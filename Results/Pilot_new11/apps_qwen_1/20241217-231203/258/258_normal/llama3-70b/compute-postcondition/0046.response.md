Functionality: **The function `func_3()` iterates over all possible integer values of `x` and `y` within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). For each combination of `x` and `y`, it calls the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` which presumably generates a list of times. These times are then sorted, and the K-th smallest element from each sorted list is considered. The function keeps track of the minimum value among these K-th smallest elements across all combinations of `x` and `y`. After completing all iterations, it returns this minimum value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input ranges for `x` and `y` might cause integer overflow or where the input constraints for `K` and `N` might not be fully validated within the provided code. However, since the provided code only focuses on the iteration and calculation of the K-th smallest element, the function does not explicitly handle these edge cases.**

**Actions performed:**
- Iterates over all possible integer values of `x` and `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
- Calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each combination of `x` and `y`.
- Sorts the returned list of times from `func_2`.
- Keeps track of the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all generated sorted lists.
- Returns the minimum value found.

**Final State:**
- The program returns the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all the times lists generated during the loop iterations, where each times list is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and `y` has iterated through the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
