The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables directly but changes the flow of the loop. Given the initial state, the values of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]`, `j` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 1`, `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains true, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]`, `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2\)**
