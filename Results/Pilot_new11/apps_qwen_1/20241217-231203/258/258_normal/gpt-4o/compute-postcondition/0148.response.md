The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not changed by this statement. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T` and its current value is less than 0, and the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` remain unchanged**
