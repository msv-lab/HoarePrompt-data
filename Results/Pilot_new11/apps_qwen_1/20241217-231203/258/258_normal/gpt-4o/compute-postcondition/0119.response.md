`x2` is assigned the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is assigned the value of `meats[j][1]`, and `c2` is assigned the value of `meats[j][2]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` retains its value, `dy` retains its value, `d2` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, `my` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[j][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `d` retains its value, `cx` retains its value, `cy` retains its value, `count` retains its value.**
