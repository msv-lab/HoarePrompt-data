First, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

- Initial State: `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)`.
- The code snippet is: `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`

The code calculates `mx` using the formula involving `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and mathematical operations. However, the values of `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` are not affected by this calculation.

To ensure accuracy, let's break down the calculation:
- `d2` is already defined as `((x1 - x2) / 2)`.
- `dy` is also defined as `(y1 - y2) / 2`.

The code does not modify `dx`, `dy`, or `d2`. The expression `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` is calculated, and `mx` is assigned the result of `cx + dy * (math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`.

Since the code does not change the values of `dx`, `dy`, or `d2`, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)`, and `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
