The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `meats`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `meats` represents the coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat and has the form `(x, y, c)`, where `x` and `y` are integers within the range [-1000, 1000], and `c` is an integer within the range [1, 100]. The length of the list `meats` is equal to `N`, and there exist integers `N` and `K` such that `1 <= K <= N`.

The function does not have a specified return value or behavior based on the given constraints alone. However, following the pattern from the example, we need to state what the function returns based on the given cases.

Since no specific return values or conditions are provided in the problem statement other than the constraints, we can infer that the function might return a specific value or set of values based on some internal logic that is not detailed here. Given the constraints, if we were to follow the example format, we would need additional information about the output.
