Postcondition: ***`d2` is \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}\); `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `N` is at least 2, `meats` is a list of tuples, `i` is updated to the next index, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `x2` is either `x1` or the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `y2` is either `y1` or the second element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `c2` is either `c1` or the third element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `mx` is `x1` or `cx + dy * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}`, `my` is `y1` or \((y1 + y2) / 2 - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}\), `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ^ 2 + (my - y) ^ 2)` for all tuples in `meats` excluding the first and second one, and `count` is less than `K` if `d * d2 > d2`. If `d * d2 <= d2`, `i` is updated to the next index and the same process repeats.***
