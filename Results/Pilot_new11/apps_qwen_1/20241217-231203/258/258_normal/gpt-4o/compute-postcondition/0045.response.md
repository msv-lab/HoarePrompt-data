Output State: **`d2` is \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}\); `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `N` is at least 2, `meats` is a list of tuples, `i` is updated to the next index, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `x2` is either `x1` or the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `y2` is either `y1` or the second element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `c2` is either `c1` or the third element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\), `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\), `dx` is \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\), `dy` is \(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\), `mx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2} + \frac{y1 - y2}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2}\), `my` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2} - \frac{(x1 - x2)}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d2 \cdot d - d^2}}{d2}\), `count` is the sum of `c * \mathbf{math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2)}` for all tuples in `meats` excluding the first and second one, and `count` is `sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2) <= T for x, y, c in meats)`**.
