Postcondition: **`x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are replaced by the first, second, and third elements of the j-th tuple in `meats`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` take the values of the first, second, and third elements of the j-th tuple in `meats`; `N`, `i`, `meats`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged. The current value of `c1 * T` is less than the current value of `c2 * T`.**
