The code snippet updates the value of `cy` to be the average of `y1` and `y2`. The previous value of `cy` was \((meats[i][1] + meats[i][1]) / 2\), which simplifies to `y1 + y2` because `y1` and `y2` are both `meats[i][1]`.

After the assignment, `cy` is now \((y1 + y2) / 2\).

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]`, `j` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 1`, `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains true, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is `(meats[i][0] - meats[i][0]) / 2`, `dy` is `(meats[i][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2`, `d2` is `((meats[i][0] - meats[i][0]) / 2)^2 + ((meats[i][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is \(\frac{meats[i][1] + meats[i][1]}{2} - \frac{(meats[i][0] - meats[i][0]) / 2 \cdot \sqrt{\left(\frac{meats[i][0] - meats[i][0]}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{meats[i][1] - meats[i][1]}{2}\right)^2 \cdot d - d}}{\left(\frac{meats[i][0] - meats[i][0]}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{meats[i][1] - meats[i][1]}{2}\right)^2}\), `count` is less than `K` and updated by the sum operation.**
