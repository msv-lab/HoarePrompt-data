The code prints the value of `result` formatted to 6 decimal places. However, the value of `result` is obtained from the function call `func_2(N, K, meats)`, where `K` is not defined in the initial state, and `meats` is a list of `N` tuples each represented as `(x, y, c)`. The initial state does not specify the values of `N`, `K`, or the contents of the `meats` list. Therefore, the value of `result` is determined by the function `func_2`, but its exact value cannot be specified without more information.

The only changes made by the code are the printing of `result` formatted to 6 decimal places and the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)` which is stored in `result`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples each represented as `(x, y, c)`, `index` is `3 * N + 2`, `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`, and the value of `result` is printed formatted to 6 decimal places.**
