The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution does not change the values of any variables. The precondition remains the same.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `N`, `i`, `meats`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged. The current value of `d` is less than 0.**
