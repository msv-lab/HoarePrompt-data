`dy` is assigned the value `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `y1` and `y2` remains unchanged, so `dy` is updated based on these values. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx` remain unchanged, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
