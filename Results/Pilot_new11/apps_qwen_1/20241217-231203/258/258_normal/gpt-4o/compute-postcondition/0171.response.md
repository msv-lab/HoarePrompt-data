The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this context, since no variables are updated or changed by the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed. 

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `j` is `i_end`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains false, `x1` is `meats[i_end - 1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i_end - 1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i_end - 1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` are unchanged, `count` is the number of elements `(x, y, c)` in the `meats` list satisfying the condition, and `count` is less than `K`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
