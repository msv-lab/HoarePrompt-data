Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, and the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false. Depending on the falsity of the condition, either `x1` is replaced by `x2`, `y1` is replaced by `y2`, and `c1` is replaced by `c2` from `meats[j]`, or the values remain unchanged as they were in `meats[i]`.***
