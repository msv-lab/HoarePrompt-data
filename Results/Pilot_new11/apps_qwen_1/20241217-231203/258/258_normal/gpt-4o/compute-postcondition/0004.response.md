The code assigns the value `2` to the variable `index`. The initial values of `data`, `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2**
