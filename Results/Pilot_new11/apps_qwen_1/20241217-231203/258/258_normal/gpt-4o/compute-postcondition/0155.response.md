`d2` is assigned the value `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Given that `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), the value of `d2` can be expressed as \(dx^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx` remain unchanged, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(dx^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\)**
