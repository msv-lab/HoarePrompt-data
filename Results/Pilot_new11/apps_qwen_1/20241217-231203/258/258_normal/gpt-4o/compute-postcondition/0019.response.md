The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `y`. Given that `index` is 12, `index + 1` is 13, so `y` is assigned the integer value of `data[13]`.

The initial state provides that `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, and the other variables are defined as follows:
- `N` must be greater than 1
- `meats` is a list containing two identical tuples, each with elements that are integers derived from `data[8]`, `data[9]`, and `data[10]`
- `index` is 12
- `x` is the integer value of `data[12]`
- `y` is the integer value of `data[9]` (previously)
- `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`

After executing the line `y = int(data[index + 1])`, the new value of `y` is the integer value of `data[13]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` must be greater than 1, `meats` is a list containing two identical tuples, each with elements that are integers derived from `data[8]`, `data[9]`, and `data[10]`, `index` is 12, `x` is the integer value of `data[12]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[13]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
