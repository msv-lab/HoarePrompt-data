The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the values of all the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement itself does not affect the values of the variables or add any new information.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state provided.

Output State: **`d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `N` is at least 2, `meats` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the tuple at index `i` in `meats`, `x2` is either `x1` or the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `y2` is either `y1` or the second element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `c2` is either `c1` or the third element of the tuple at index `i+1` in `meats`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `x1`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `y1`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `0`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `0`, `d2` is \(\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}\) if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `0`, `mx` is `cx + dy * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}` if \(d * d2 > d2\) and `c1 * T >= c2 * T`, otherwise `mx` is `x1` or `cx + dy * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}`, `my` is \((y1 + y2) / 2 - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d * d}}{d2}\) if `c1 * T >= c2 * T` else `y1`, `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x) ^ 2 + (my - y) ^ 2)` for all tuples in `meats` excluding the first and second one, and `count` is less than `K`.**
