Postcondition: **`d2`, `d`, `N`, `meats`, `i` remain unchanged. `cx` and `cy` are recalculated based on the new `x1` and `y1`. `dx` and `dy` are recalculated based on the new `x1` and `x2`. `mx` and `my` are recalculated based on the new `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`. `count` is recalculated based on the new `mx`, `my`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, and the range from `i` to `i + N - 1`. If `c1 * T >= c2 * T`, then the rest of the variables remain in their current state.**
