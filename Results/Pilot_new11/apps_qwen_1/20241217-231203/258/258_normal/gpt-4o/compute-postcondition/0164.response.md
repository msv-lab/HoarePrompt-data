Postcondition: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx` remain unchanged, `my = cy - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d^2}}{d2}`, `count` is the number of elements `(x, y, c)` in the `meats` list satisfying the condition, and `count` is less than `K`**
