`meats[i]` is unpacked into three variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. Since `i` is `i_end - 1`, `i` remains `i_end - 1`. The value of `N` is not affected and must still be greater than `i_end`. The new variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned the respective values from `meats[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`**
