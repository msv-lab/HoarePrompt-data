The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a tuple containing the values of `x`, `y`, and `c` to the list `meats`. From the initial state, we know that `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, and `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`. Therefore, the tuple `(x, y, c)` is appended to the list `meats`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[4]`.**
