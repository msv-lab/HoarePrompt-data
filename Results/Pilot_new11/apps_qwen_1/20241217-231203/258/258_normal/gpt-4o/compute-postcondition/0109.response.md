The code calculates `d2` as `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Since `dx` and `dy` are defined as `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2`, we can substitute these into the equation for `d2`.

Given the initial state:
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\)
- `d2` is \(((x1 - x2) / 2)\)
- `mx` is \(cx + dy * \sqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\)
- `my` is \(cy - \sqrt{d}\)
- `j` is `i + 1`
- `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`
- `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`
- `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`
- `x1` is the second element of `meats[j]`
- `y1` is the third element of `meats[j]`
- `c1` is the first element of `meats[j]`
- `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` is \((x2 + x1) / 2\)
- `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)

After executing `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy`, the updated value of `d2` is calculated as follows:
\[ d2 = \left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2 \]

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\)

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `mx` is \(cx + dy * \sqrt{(d2 * d - d * d)} / d2\), `my` is \(cy - \sqrt{d}\), `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T / (c1 * c2)\), `cx` is \((x2 + x1) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
