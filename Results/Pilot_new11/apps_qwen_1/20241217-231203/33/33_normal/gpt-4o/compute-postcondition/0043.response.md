Postcondition: ***`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is `n-1`, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer representation of the second word from the input. If `position` is outside the range [0, 20000], the condition remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes that the `position` will remain unchanged if it is outside the range [0, 20000], which aligns with the if condition provided. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the behavior when the condition in the if statement is true.
