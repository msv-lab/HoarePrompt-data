Postcondition: **`position` is the value of `t`, `dir` is the string 'North', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, for each i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `t_{i}` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6 and `dir_{i}` is a string representing a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"), `valid` is True, `t` is an integer**
