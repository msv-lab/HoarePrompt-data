Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Initial Latitude**: The initial latitude is set to 90 degrees, representing the North Pole.
2. **Movement Logic**: For each movement:
   - If the direction is "North," the latitude increases.
   - If the direction is "South," the latitude decreases.
   - Movements in "West" or "East" are ignored as they do not affect the latitude.
3. **Boundary Checks**: The code ensures that the latitude stays within the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees. If the latitude exceeds these bounds, it prints "NO" and exits.
4. **Pole Constraints**: The code checks if Limak is at the South Pole (-90 degrees) and if the next movement is not "North." Similarly, it checks if Limak is at the North Pole (90 degrees) and if the next movement is not "South." If either condition is violated, it prints "NO" and exits.
5. **Final Check**: After processing all movements, if the final latitude is exactly 90 degrees, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO."

Given the output hints, the code correctly implements the required conditions and handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
