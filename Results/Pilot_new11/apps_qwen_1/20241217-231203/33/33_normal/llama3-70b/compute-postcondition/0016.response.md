The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. As a result, none of the variables are updated, and the printed output remains as 'NO'. The conditions for `curr_lat` based on `dir` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is either 90 + `t` / 111.195 if `dir` is 'North', or 90 - `t` / 111.195 if `dir` is 'South', or 90 if `dir` is not 'North', and the printed output is 'NO'**
