Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `curr_lat` is either 90 (if `dir` is not 'North') or -90 (if `dir` is 'North').
   - If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the printed output is 'NO'. This condition does not affect the values of `n` or `curr_lat`.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations.
   - The loop body is omitted but it doesn't change the values of `n` or `curr_lat`.

3. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since the loop runs for `n` iterations and `n` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. After the previous iteration, `n` was at least 1, so for the next iteration, `n` should still be at least 1.
   - The value of `curr_lat` remains unchanged regardless of the loop execution.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be at least 1, and `curr_lat` is either 90 (if `dir` is not 'North') or -90 (if `dir` is 'North')**.
