Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir`. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is its initial state plus `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is its initial state minus `t / 111.195`. In any other case, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state. `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `dir` is the second value from input split by a space.***
