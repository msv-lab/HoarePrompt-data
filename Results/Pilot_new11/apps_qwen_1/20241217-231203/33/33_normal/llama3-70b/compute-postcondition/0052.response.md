The `exit()` function call in the provided code snippet does not return any value and will terminate the program immediately. Since the program is terminated, no further operations can be performed, and the states of the variables before calling `exit()` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir`; if `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is its initial state plus `t / 111.195`, if `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is its initial state minus `t / 111.195`; in any other case, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state. `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `dir` is the second value from input split by a space. The program has printed 'NO' to the console. The program is terminated.**
