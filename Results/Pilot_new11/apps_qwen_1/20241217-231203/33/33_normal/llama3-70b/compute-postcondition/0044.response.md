`t` and `dir` are assigned the values from the input split by a space. The input is expected to provide two values separated by a space, which are then stored in `t` and `dir`. The value of `n` remains at least 1, and `curr_lat` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state, `t` is the first value from input split by a space, `dir` is the second value from input split by a space.**
