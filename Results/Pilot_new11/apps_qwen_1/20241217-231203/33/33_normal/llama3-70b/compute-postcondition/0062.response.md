The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly listed in the function definition. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function might use variables `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` internally, but these are not passed as arguments to the function. The functionality of the function appears to involve processing these internal variables, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6, and `dir_i` is a string representing the direction ("North", "South", "West", "East").

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined in the problem statement, we can infer the function likely returns a result based on the processing of these variables.

Functionality: **The function processes internal variables `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, and `dir_i` is a string representing a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"), and returns a result based on this processing.**
