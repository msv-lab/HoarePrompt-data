`t` is assigned the value `int(t)`, which converts the string `t` into an integer. The other variables remain in their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state, `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, `dir` is the second value from input split by a space.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state, `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, `dir` is the second value from input split by a space.**
