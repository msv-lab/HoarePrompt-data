Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute.

1. **Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n`: An integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - For each \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq n\)):
     - \(t_i\): An integer where \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\).
     - \(dir_i\): A string representing the direction ("North", "South", "West", "East").
   - `curr_lat`: The initial latitude is 90.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Required Adjustments:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Given that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), we know that \(n\) can be any integer from 1 to 50 inclusive.
   - There are no other specific initial states that need adjustment based on the provided information. The values of \(t_i\) and \(dir_i\) for each \(i\) do not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute. The only requirement for the loop to run is that `n` must be at least 1.

Given this analysis:

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90**
