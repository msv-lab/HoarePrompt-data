The code assigns the value `90` to the variable `curr_lat`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the lists `t_i` and `dir_i`. The initial state's condition for `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `curr_lat`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), `t_{i}` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6 and `dir_{i}` is a string representing the direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"); `curr_lat` is 90.**
