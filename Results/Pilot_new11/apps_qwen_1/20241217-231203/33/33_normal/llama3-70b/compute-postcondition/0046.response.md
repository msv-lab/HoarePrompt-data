`curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. Since `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `n` is at least 1, the value of `t` is an integer, but the exact value is not specified. However, we know that `curr_lat` will be updated by this operation. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is its initial state plus `t / 111.195`, `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, `dir` is the second value from input split by a space.**
