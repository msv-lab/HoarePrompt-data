Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, and `curr_lat` is either 90 (if `dir` is not 'North') or -90 (if `dir` is 'North'). If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the printed output is 'NO'. There is no change in the values of `n` and `curr_lat` regardless of the condition in the if statement.***
