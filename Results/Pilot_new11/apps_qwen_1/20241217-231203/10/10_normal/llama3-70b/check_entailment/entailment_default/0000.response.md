Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to match the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The function `func_1` counts the number of sofas to the left and right based on the x-coordinates and the number of sofas above and below based on the y-coordinates. However, it only checks if the x-coordinates are strictly less than or greater than, without considering whether the y-coordinates are the same. This means it does not correctly count sofas that are directly to the left, right, top, or bottom.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the sofas are placed at the boundaries of the storehouse or when there are multiple sofas aligned horizontally or vertically.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

```plaintext
Input:
2
3 2
3 1 3 2
1 2 2 2
1 0 0 1
```

The correct output should be `1`, as the first sofa (3,1,3,2) has 1 sofa to its left (the second sofa), 0 sofas to its right, 0 sofas above, and 1 sofa below. However, the program does not correctly count these conditions.

A corrected version of the function `func_1` should be:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

However, even with this correction, the original implementation still fails to handle all potential edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect for every potential case.
