Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values `d`, `n`, `m`, the coordinates of the sofas, and the counts `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`.

2. **Coordinate Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the coordinates of each sofa and stores them in a list called `sofas`. Each sofa is represented as a tuple of coordinates `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa `sofa` based on the provided logic:
     - `left`: Count of sofas to the left of `sofa` and with the same y-coordinate.
     - `right`: Count of sofas to the right of `sofa` and with the same y-coordinate.
     - `top`: Count of sofas above `sofa` and with the same x-coordinate.
     - `bottom`: Count of sofas below `sofa` and with the same x-coordinate.
   - The function iterates over all sofas in the `sofas` list, excluding the current `sofa`, and updates the counts accordingly.

4. **Condition Checking:**
   - After calculating the counts using `func_1`, the program checks if these counts match the given `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`.
   - If the counts match, it prints the index of the matching sofa (plus one to convert from zero-based indexing to one-based indexing).
   - If no matching sofa is found, it prints `-1`.

### Why the Program Follows the Problem Description:

- **Correct Input Handling:** The program correctly reads and processes the input according to the problem statement.
- **Proper Calculation of Counts:** The function `func_1` correctly calculates the counts of sofas relative to the given sofa based on the specified conditions (left, right, top, bottom).
- **Matching Conditions:** The program checks if the calculated counts match the provided counts and outputs the appropriate result.

### Edge Cases Considered:

- The program handles the case where the input is valid and will not encounter errors due to invalid inputs as per the assumptions provided.
- The program accounts for all possible combinations of counts for the sofas, ensuring that it will either find a matching sofa or report `-1` if none matches.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid cases, the correctness of the program is `True`.
