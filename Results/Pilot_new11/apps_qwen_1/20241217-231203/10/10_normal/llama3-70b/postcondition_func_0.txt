The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa`, a tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), and `sofas`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains the coordinates of a sofa. It iterates through the `sofas` list (excluding the `sofa` itself) to count the number of sofas that have the same y-coordinate but are to the left (`left`) or right (`right`) of `sofa`, and the number of sofas that have the same x-coordinate but are above (`top`) or below (`bottom`) `sofa`. The function then returns these counts as `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`. The function handles the case where `sofa` might be one of the sofas in the `sofas` list. If `sofa` is not present in `sofas`, the function still correctly counts the relevant sofas based on their coordinates.
