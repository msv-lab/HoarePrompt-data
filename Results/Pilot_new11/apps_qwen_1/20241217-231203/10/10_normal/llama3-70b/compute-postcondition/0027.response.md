`left` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `left` was based on the previous tuple `s` and the first sofa in `sofas`. Since only `left` is updated, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; `right` is increased by 1, `top` is increased by 1, `bottom` is increased by 1; `left` is the updated value based on the previous tuple `s` and the first sofa in `sofas` + 1.**
