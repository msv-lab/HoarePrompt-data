The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa`, which is a tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), and `sofas`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the coordinates of a sofa. The function also involves integers `d`, `n`, `m` such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, but these are not directly used in the function signature.

After executing the function body, the function returns four values: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`. Specifically, `left` is the count of sofas to the left of `sofa` and with the same y-coordinate, `right` is the count of sofas to the right of `sofa` and with the same y-coordinate, `top` is the count of sofas above `sofa` and with the same x-coordinate, and `bottom` is the count of sofas below `sofa` and with the same x-coordinate.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sofa's coordinates and a list of sofas' coordinates, and return counts of sofas positioned relative to the given sofa based on their coordinates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `sofa` (a tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa) and a parameter `sofas` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the coordinates of a sofa). It returns `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` where `left` is the count of sofas to the left of `sofa` and with the same y-coordinate, `right` is the count of sofas to the right of `sofa` and with the same y-coordinate, `top` is the count of sofas above `sofa` and with the same x-coordinate, and `bottom` is the count of sofas below `sofa` and with the same x-coordinate.**
