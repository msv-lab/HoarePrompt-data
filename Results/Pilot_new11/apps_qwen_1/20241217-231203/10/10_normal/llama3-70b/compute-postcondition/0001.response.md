To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider what the loop is iterating over and what conditions must be met for the loop to run.

Given:
- `sofa` is a tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2).
- `sofas` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the coordinates of a sofa.
- `d`, `n`, and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10^5\), \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\).
- `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.

The loop iterates over each tuple in the `sofas` list. For the loop to execute, `sofas` must contain at least one element (tuple). 

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Sofas List**: The loop requires that `sofas` is a non-empty list. If `sofas` is empty, the loop will not execute.
2. **Initial Values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`**: These values are given as 0, but they don't affect the loop's ability to execute. The loop will still run regardless of their initial values.

Thus, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that the `sofas` list is not empty.

State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa, and `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.**
