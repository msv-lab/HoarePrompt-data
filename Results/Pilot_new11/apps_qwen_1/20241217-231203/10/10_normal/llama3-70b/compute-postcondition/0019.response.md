The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. The value of `right` was previously unknown, but now it is increased by 1. The other variables (`sofas`, `s`, and `left`) remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; if the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and their y-coordinates are equal, then `left` is increased by 1; `right` is increased by 1.**
