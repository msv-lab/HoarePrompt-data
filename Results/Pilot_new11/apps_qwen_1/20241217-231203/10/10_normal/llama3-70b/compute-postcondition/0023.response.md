`bottom` is incremented by 1. The value of `left` depends on the condition comparing the x-coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas` and the x-coordinate of `s`, and whether their y-coordinates are equal. The values of `right` and `top` are both increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; `left` is increased by 1 if the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and their y-coordinates are equal, otherwise `left` remains unchanged; `right` is increased by 1; `top` is increased by 1; `bottom` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; `left` is increased by 1 if the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and their y-coordinates are equal, otherwise `left` remains unchanged; `right` is increased by 1; `top` is increased by 1; `bottom` is increased by 1.**
