Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa. For the first sofa in `sofas`, if its x-coordinate is greater than the x-coordinate of `s` and has the same y-coordinate as `s`, then `left` and `right` values remain 1, while `top` is 1 and `bottom` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged. The values of `top` and `bottom` remain 0.***
