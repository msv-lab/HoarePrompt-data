The code `left += 1` increments the value of the variable `left` by 1. The initial state does not specify the exact value of `left`, but it implies that `left` is an integer. The other variables (`sofas` and `s`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; `left` is increased by 1.**
