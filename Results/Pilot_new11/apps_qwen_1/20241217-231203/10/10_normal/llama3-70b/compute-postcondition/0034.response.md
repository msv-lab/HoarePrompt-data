Postcondition: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; `right` is increased by 1; `top` is increased by 1; `bottom` is increased by 1; `left` is updated based on the previous tuple `s` and the first sofa in `sofas`. If the first sofa's x-coordinate is less than the current `s`'s x-coordinate and they share the same y-coordinate, `left` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged.**
