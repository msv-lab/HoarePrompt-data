Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of sofas (`d`), the dimensions of the storehouse (`n` and `m`), the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`) from the input.
   - The input handling ensures that the program can process the given data structure as described in the problem statement.

2. **Sofa Counting Logic**:
   - For each sofa, the program calculates the number of sofas to its left (`left_count`), right (`right_count`), top (`top_count`), and bottom (`bottom_count`).
   - This is done by comparing the coordinates of each pair of sofas and incrementing the respective counters accordingly. The logic correctly identifies the relative positions based on the given conditions.

3. **Target Sofa Identification**:
   - After calculating the counts for each sofa, the program iterates through the `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` arrays to find a sofa that matches the given counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).
   - If a match is found, the corresponding sofa number (1-indexed) is printed. If no match is found, the program prints `-1`.

4. **Guarantee of Unique Solution**:
   - The problem guarantees that there is at most one sofa that meets the given conditions. Therefore, the program's logic will correctly identify the unique sofa (if it exists) or return `-1` if no such sofa exists.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem statement and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
