Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a sofa can be both to the top and to the bottom of another sofa. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
2 2
1 1 2 1
2 2 2 1
1 0 0 1
```

In this case, the first sofa (1 1 2 1) should have 1 sofa to its left (which is the second sofa), and 0 sofas to its right and bottom. However, the second sofa (2 2 2 1) should have 1 sofa to its left (which is the first sofa), and 0 sofas to its right and top. 

The current implementation incorrectly counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom without considering the conditions properly. Specifically, the program does not check if the conditions are met correctly for each sofa, especially when a sofa can be both above and below another sofa.

For instance, in the given example, the program will incorrectly count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom for each sofa, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
