Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[2]`, `top_count[i]` is increased by 1, `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged, and `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`.***
