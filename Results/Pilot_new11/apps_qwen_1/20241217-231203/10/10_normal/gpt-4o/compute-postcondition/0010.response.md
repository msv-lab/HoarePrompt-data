The code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())` reads four integers from the user input and assigns them to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` respectively. The initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input integers, and the initial list `sofas` contains tuples of input integers. However, since the code overwrites the initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` with new inputs, we need to represent the new values.

The output state after running the code will be:
- `sofas` remains unchanged as it does not get updated by the code.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are updated to the new input values.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`sofas` is [(input integer, input integer, input integer, input integer), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]; `x1` is new input integer; `y1` is new input integer; `x2` is new input integer; `y2` is new input integer; `d` is a positive integer and is equal to `d`**
