The code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = sofas[i]` unpacks the tuple from the list `sofas` at index `i` into four separate variables: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The value of `sofas[i]` is a tuple containing four elements, which are assigned to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` respectively. 

The precondition that `sofas` is a list of tuples that must contain at least `d` tuples, and `d` must be greater than 0, remains valid. However, the specific values of `sofas` and the contents of the tuple at index `i` are not provided, so we cannot specify exact values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples that must contain at least `d` tuples, `d` must be greater than 0; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are the first, second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple `sofas[i]` respectively.**
