Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j` is equal to `x1` from `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is equal to `y1` from `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is equal to `x2` from `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is equal to `y2` from `sofas[j]`, and `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
