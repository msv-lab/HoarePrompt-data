The code `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. The initial state shows that `left_count[i]` is not specified, but it is being updated from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`j` is 0, `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j` is equal to `x1` from `sofas[i]`, `y1_j` is equal to `y1` from `sofas[i]`, `x2_j` is equal to `x2` from `sofas[i]`, `y2_j` is equal to `y2` from `sofas[i]`, and `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1.**
