`left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `left_count[i]` was previously unspecified in the initial state, but now it is increased by 1. The conditions for incrementing `right_count[i]` remain unchanged, so the state of `right_count[i]` does not change.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, and the state of `right_count[i]` remains unchanged.**
