The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. The initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are provided as inputs. The list `sofas` initially contains two tuples, and each tuple consists of four integers. After appending, `sofas` will have three tuples.

The states of the other variables (`d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is [(input integer, input integer, input integer, input integer), (x1, y1, x2, y2), (x1, y1, x2, y2)]; `x1` is new input integer; `y1` is new input integer; `x2` is new input integer; `y2` is new input integer; `d` is a positive integer and is equal to `d`**
