According to the given code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from `0` to `d-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas.
- `d` is a positive integer.
- `i` is in the range `0` to `d-2`.
- `target_sofa` is `i + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `d-1`.

Let's summarize the updated states:

- `sofas` remains a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas.
- `d` remains a positive integer.
- `i` will be `d-1`.
- `target_sofa` will be `d` because `target_sofa = i + 1` and `i` will now be `d-1`.

State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is `d-1`, and `target_sofa` is `d`.**
