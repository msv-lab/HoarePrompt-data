Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j` is equal to `x1` from `sofas[i]`, `y1_j` is equal to `y1` from `sofas[i]`, `x2_j` is equal to `x2` from `sofas[i]`, `y2_j` is equal to `y2` from `sofas[i]`, and if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1.***
