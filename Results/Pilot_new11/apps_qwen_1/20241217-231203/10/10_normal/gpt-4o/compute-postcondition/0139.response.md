Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`. Since the if condition `i == j` is true, the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged.***
