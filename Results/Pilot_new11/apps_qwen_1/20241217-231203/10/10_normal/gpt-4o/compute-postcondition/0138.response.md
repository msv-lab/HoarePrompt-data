The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, nor does it affect the state of the list or the conditions of the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`**
