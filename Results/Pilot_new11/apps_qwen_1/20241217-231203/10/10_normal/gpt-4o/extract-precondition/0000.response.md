Precondition: **d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, there are d lines each containing four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m, and (x_1, y_1) ≠ (x_2, y_2)), and cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b are integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1.**
