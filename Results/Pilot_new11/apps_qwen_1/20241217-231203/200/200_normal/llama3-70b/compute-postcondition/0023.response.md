Postcondition: **`low` and `high` are such that `low` is less than `high`, and `mid` is the ceiling of the average of `low` and `high`. `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` equals `mid`. Otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1` and `low` remains less than `high`.**
