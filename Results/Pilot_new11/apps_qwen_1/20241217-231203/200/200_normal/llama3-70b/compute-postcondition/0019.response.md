`mid` is assigned the value `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The value of `low` is less than `high`, so the calculation of `mid` is based on this condition. The exact numerical value of `mid` depends on the specific values of `low` and `high`, but we know that `mid` is the ceiling of the average of `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`low` is less than `high`; `mid` is the ceiling of the average of `low` and `high`**
