The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `v`. Since the input is split and converted, `v` will contain integers, but the specific values are not known from the initial state. However, we know that the length of the list `v` will be equal to `n`, and each element in the list will be an integer between 1 and \(10^9\).

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input integer.
- `v` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).

After executing the code, the list `v` will be updated with the new values from the input, but the specific values are not provided. The initial values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\), where `v` is updated with the new values from the input.**
