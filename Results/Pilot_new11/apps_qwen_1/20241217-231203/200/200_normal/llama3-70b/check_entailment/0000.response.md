Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the required amount of kvass `s` is greater than the total amount of kvass available across all kegs. In such a scenario, the program will incorrectly calculate the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg without checking if it's feasible to obtain `s` liters of kvass.

For example, consider the following input:

Input
```
3 10
4 3 5
```

The total amount of kvass is `4 + 3 + 5 = 12`, which is less than `s = 10`. Therefore, it is impossible to get 10 liters of kvass. However, the program will still output a value for the minimum amount of kvass in the least keg, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `-1`.

To fix this, the program should check if the total amount of kvass is at least `s` before attempting to distribute it among the kegs.
