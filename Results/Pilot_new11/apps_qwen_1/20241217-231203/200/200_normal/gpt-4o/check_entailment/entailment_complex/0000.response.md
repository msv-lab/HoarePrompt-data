Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( s \) from standard input, followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the volumes \( v_i \).
   - It ensures \( n \) and \( s \) are within the specified ranges, and the volumes \( v_i \) are also within the specified ranges.

2. **Sorting Volumes**:
   - The volumes are sorted in non-decreasing order, ensuring that the smallest keg comes first.

3. **Initial Total Volume Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total volume of all kegs. This is necessary to check if the total volume is sufficient to provide \( s \) liters of kvass.

4. **Checking Total Volume**:
   - If the total volume is less than \( s \), the program prints \(-1\) immediately, indicating it's impossible to pour \( s \) liters of kvass.

5. **Distributing Kvas**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of volumes, ensuring that the smallest keg is filled as much as possible while still meeting the requirement that the least keg has the maximum possible volume.
   - For each keg, it calculates the maximum amount of kvass that can be taken from that keg without reducing the minimum keg volume below the current value.

6. **Adjusting Minimum Keg Volume**:
   - After distributing kvass as much as possible, the program checks if there is any remaining kvass that couldn't be evenly distributed.
   - If there is remaining kvass, it adjusts the minimum keg volume accordingly using the formula `min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final minimum keg volume, which is either the adjusted value or the initial value of the smallest keg.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement. It checks if the total volume is sufficient, distributes the kvass as evenly as possible starting from the smallest keg, and adjusts the minimum keg volume based on the remaining kvass. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
