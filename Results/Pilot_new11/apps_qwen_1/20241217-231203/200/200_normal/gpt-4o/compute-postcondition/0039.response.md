The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems that the function might operate on some internal or external data. Given the constraints, the function should handle an integer \( n \) which is between 1 and \( 10^3 \), an integer \( s \) which is between 1 and \( 10^{12} \), and a list of integers \( v_i \) where each \( v_i \) is between 1 and \( 10^9 \) and the length of the list is \( n \).

The output cases are not directly related to the parameters but rather the result of processing the mentioned data.

Given the structure of the problem, the function likely computes something based on \( n \), \( s \), and the list \( v_i \). Since no specific output cases are provided in the format requested, we can only describe the accepted parameters and their constraints.
