Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\); `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\); `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `total_volume` is the sum of all elements in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, -1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `min_keg_volume` is calculated as `volumes[0] - ((remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n)` if `remaining_kvass > 0`, otherwise `min_keg_volume` remains unchanged.***
