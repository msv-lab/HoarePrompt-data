`script` is appended with the string `f'move {file} {i}'`. The value of `n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 1`, and `file` is the `n`-th element in `examples`. The value of `i` is `n`. After executing the code, `script` now contains the new string, and the values of `n`, `file`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 1`, `file` is the `n`-th element in `examples`, `i` is `n`, `script` is appended with `f'move {file} {i}'`**
