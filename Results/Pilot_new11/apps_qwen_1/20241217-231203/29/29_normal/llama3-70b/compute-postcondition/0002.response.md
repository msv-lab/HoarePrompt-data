Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop uses `range(n)`, which means the loop will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't run).

2. **Identify the Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer input provided by the user within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `files` is an empty list.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - Since `n` is an integer input provided by the user, we need to ensure that `n` is a valid positive integer.
   - The state of `files` does not change during the loop initialization but may change inside the loop, so no adjustments are needed for `files` before the loop starts.

4. **Formulate the Required States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` will only generate numbers if `n` is a positive integer.
   - The initial value of `files` is already given as an empty list, so no adjustment is needed here.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `files` is an empty list**
