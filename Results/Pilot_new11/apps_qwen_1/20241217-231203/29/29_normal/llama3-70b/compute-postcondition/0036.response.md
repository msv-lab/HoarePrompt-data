The code `print(line)` prints the value of `line`. Since `line` is the third element of `script`, it remains unchanged. The only effect is the printing of `line`. The output state is: `script` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least three elements, `line` is the third element of `script`, and the value of `line` is printed.

Output State: **`script` is a non-empty iterable that must have at least three elements, `line` is the third element of `script`, and the value of `line` is printed.**
