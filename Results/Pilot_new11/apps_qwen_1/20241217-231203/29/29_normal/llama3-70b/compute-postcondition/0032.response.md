The code `print(line)` will print the first element of the `script` iterable. However, since the actual value of `line` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact printed value. But we know that `line` is the first element of the `script` iterable.

Output State: **`script` is a non-empty iterable, `line` is the first element of `script`, and `line` is printed.**
