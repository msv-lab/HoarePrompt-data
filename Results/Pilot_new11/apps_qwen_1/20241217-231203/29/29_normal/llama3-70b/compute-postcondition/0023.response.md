Let's break down the given task step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive.
- `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least `n` elements.
- `i` is `n`.
- `file` is the `n`-th element in `examples`.
- `script` is a list containing the strings `'move {file} {i}'`, `'move {file} {i-1}'`, ..., `'move {file} 2'`, `'move {file} 1'`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Variables in the For Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over pairs `(i, file)` where `i` starts from `len(examples) + 1` and increments by 1.
   - `file` is the element from the `regular` list corresponding to the current value of `i`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - Initially, `i` is set to `n` (which is `n`).
   - `file` is set to the `n`-th element in `examples`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 1`.

4. **Determining Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and the loop condition is `i <= len(examples) + 1`, we need to ensure that `n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 1`.
   - Additionally, `file` should be correctly set to the element in `examples` corresponding to the initial value of `i`.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure `n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 1`.
- Ensure `file` is correctly set to the `n`-th element in `examples`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is less than or equal to `len(examples) + 1`, `file` is the `n`-th element in `examples`, `i` is `n`**
