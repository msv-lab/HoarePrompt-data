`files` is an empty list before the code execution. After executing `files.append((name, int(type_)))`, the list `files` will contain a single tuple `(name, int(type_))`. The values of `n`, `name`, and `type_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `files` is a list containing a single tuple `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is the first part of the input, `type_` is the second part of the input**
