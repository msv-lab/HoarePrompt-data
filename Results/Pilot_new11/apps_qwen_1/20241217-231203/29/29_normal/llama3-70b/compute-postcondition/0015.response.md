The code initializes an empty list named `script`. This means that `script` is now an empty list, but none of the other variables (`n`, `files`, `examples`, `regular`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive; `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value; `examples` is a list of strings which are the `name` values from the tuples in `files` where the `type_` is 1; `regular` is a list of `name` values from the tuples in `files` where the `type_` is 0; `script` is an empty list**
