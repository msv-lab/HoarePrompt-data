The code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` appends a new string to the `script` list. This new string is formatted using the values of `file` and `i`. Given the initial state, `file` is the third element in `examples`, and `i` is 3. Therefore, the new string added to `script` is `f'move {file} 3'`.

- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive.
- `examples` remains a list of strings with at least two elements.
- `i` remains 3.
- `file` remains the third element in `examples`.
- `script` now contains three elements: `['move {file} {i}', f'move {file} 2', f'move {file} 3']`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive, `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least two elements, `i` is 3, `file` is the third element in `examples`, and `script` is a list containing the strings `'move {file} {i}', f'move {file} 2', f'move {file} 3'`**.
