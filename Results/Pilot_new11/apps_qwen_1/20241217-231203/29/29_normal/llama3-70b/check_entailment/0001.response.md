Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where there are no example tests. In such a case, the program will still generate a script to move files, even though no examples need to be moved. This does not align with the requirement that the examples should be the first several tests if they exist. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
2
1 0
2 0
```

The program will output:
```
2
move 1 1
move 2 2
```

This output is incorrect because there are no example tests, and moving files unnecessarily does not achieve the desired renaming scheme. The correct output should be:
```
0
```

Since the program does not handle the case where there are no example tests, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
