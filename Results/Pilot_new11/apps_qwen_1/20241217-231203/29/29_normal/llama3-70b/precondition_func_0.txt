n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. There are n lines describing filenames and their types, where each filename is a string of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, and each type is either "1" indicating an example test or "0" indicating a regular test. All filenames are distinct.
