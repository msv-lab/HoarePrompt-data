To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `i` is 8 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` + 1. This means `temp_counter` starts as the smallest value greater than `2 * n` or a value whose string representation is not in `files_set`.
   - `examples` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} 18'` (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1 (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `target` is 17 (not directly relevant to the loop condition).

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that both conditions are met initially or can be met after adjusting the state.

### Required Adjustments:

- **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
  - If `temp_counter` is already greater than `2 * n`, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

- **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
  - If `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that both conditions are met for the loop to execute at least one more time. Specifically, `temp_counter` should be a value such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

### Conclusion:

State: **`temp_counter` must be a value such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
