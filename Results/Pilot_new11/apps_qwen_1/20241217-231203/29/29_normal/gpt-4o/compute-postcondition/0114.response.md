Postcondition: ***`i` is 8, `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than `2 * n` or such that `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` plus 1, `examples` remains as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} 18'`, `len(regulars)` is greater than or equal to 1, `target` is 17. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `i` becomes 9 and `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[8]} {temp_counter}'`. If `regulars[i]` equals `str(target)`, no changes occur in the listed variables.***
