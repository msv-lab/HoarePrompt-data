`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The precondition that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.**
