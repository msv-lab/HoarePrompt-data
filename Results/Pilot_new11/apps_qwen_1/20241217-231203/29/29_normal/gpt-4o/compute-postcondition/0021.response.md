`temp_counter` is assigned the value of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is an integer representing the number of files, so `temp_counter` is set to `n + 1`. The states of the other variables (`files`, `examples`, `regulars`, and `moves`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files; `files` is a list of strings with all files; `examples` is a list containing all names of files with type "1"; `regulars` is a list containing all names of files with type "0"; `moves` is an empty list; `temp_counter` is `n + 1`.**
