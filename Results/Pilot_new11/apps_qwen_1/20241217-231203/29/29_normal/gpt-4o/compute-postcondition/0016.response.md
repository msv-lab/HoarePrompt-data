The code `examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name`, which is "new_name", to the list `examples`. The initial state of `examples` is a list containing "example". After appending "new_name" to `examples`, the list `examples` will contain both "example" and "new_name".

The variables `name`, `type_`, `files`, and `regulars` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated states are:
- `name` is "new_name"
- `type_` remains unchanged, so it is still "1"
- `files` remains unchanged
- `examples` is now a list containing "example" and "new_name"
- `regulars` remains unchanged

Output State: **`name` is "new_name", `type_` is "1", `files` is a list of strings with at least two files, `examples` is a list containing "example" and "new_name", `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example".**
