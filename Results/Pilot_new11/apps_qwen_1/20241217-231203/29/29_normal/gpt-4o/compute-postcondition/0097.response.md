`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`. Since the exact value of `n` and the contents of `files_set` are not specified, we know that `temp_counter` was previously set to a value satisfying the condition. After incrementing `temp_counter` by 1, it will still satisfy the condition because adding 1 to a number that was already greater than another number or did not appear in a set will still satisfy the same condition.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 7, `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` + 1, `examples` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[7]} {temp_counter}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is 18, `regulars[7]` is `str(temp_counter + 1)`**
