`temp_counter` is initially equal to `2 * n + len(files_set)`, and it must have been in `files_set` throughout the iterations. The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. The value of `temp_counter` changes to `2 * n + len(files_set) + 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is 2 * n + len(files_set) + 1, and it must have been in `files_set` throughout the iterations; `regulars[i]` is a string representation of `temp_counter`.**
