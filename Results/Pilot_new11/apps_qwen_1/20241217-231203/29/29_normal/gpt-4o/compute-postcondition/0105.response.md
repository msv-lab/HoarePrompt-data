`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` still holds, and `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`. Therefore, the updated value of `temp_counter` is one more than its original value, and it still meets the conditions specified.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter` <= 2 * n, and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
