Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 after each iteration (`temp_counter = temp_counter + 1`).
   - The loop condition is `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - The condition `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set` must also be true.

2. **Loop Condition Evaluation:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied:
     1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     2. `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`

3. **Current Values:**
   - After the previous iteration, `temp_counter` was incremented.
   - The current state shows `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, meaning `temp_counter` is one more than what it was in the previous iteration.
   - The condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` must hold.
   - The condition `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set` must also hold.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `temp_counter` was incremented, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` (in its new value) still satisfies the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - Additionally, the condition `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Given the above analysis, we need to adjust the state to reflect these conditions:

- `temp_counter` must be such that it satisfies `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`temp_counter` is such that `temp_counter + 1` <= 2 * n and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`**
