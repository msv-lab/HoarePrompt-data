`regulars` is appended with the value of `name`, which is "example". The values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, `type_`, and `name` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer representing the number of files; `files` is a list of strings with at least one file; `examples` is an empty list; `regulars` is a list containing "example"; `name` is "example"; `type_` is "txt" and the condition `type_ == '1'` is false.
