The code splits the string `file` into two parts using the split method and assigns them to `name` and `type_`. Since the initial value of `name` is "example", and `type_` is "1" if `type_ == '1'` is true, otherwise it remains "txt", we need to determine which of these conditions holds true after the split operation.

Let's assume `file` is a string in the form of "example 1" (this is a common format for such operations). After splitting:

- `name` will be set to "example".
- `type_` will be set to "1".

The other variables (`files`, `examples`, `regulars`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `name` is "example".
- `type_` is "1".
- The other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`name` is "example", `type_` is "1", `files` is a list of strings with at least one file (reduced by one), `examples` is an empty list or includes "example", `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example".**
