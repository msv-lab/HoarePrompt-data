Let's analyze the given conditions step by step:

1. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` (meaning it has increased by 1).
   - `temp_counter` still satisfies `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `temp_counter` must still satisfy `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` has just incremented by 1, we need to ensure that:
- `temp_counter` is still within the range `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` is still present in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` has just been incremented, the new value of `temp_counter` will be `temp_counter + 1`. Therefore, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` must still hold true, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

To summarize:
- `temp_counter` must be such that `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` and still satisfies `temp_counter + 1 <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`**
