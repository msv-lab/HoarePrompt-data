Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(examples)`, `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index (i.e., `str(index + 1)`), `moves` is a list containing the move operations required to achieve the correct order, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 1`, and the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`**
