Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(examples) + 1`
- `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`
- `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index
- `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`
- `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`

### Loop Code:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    temp_counter += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`.

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - Each iteration of the loop increments `temp_counter` by 1.
   - The loop stops when `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n` or when `str(temp_counter)` is no longer in `files_set`.

### Output States:
- After 1 iteration: 
  - `i` remains `len(examples) + 1`
  - `temp_counter` becomes `len(examples) + 1` or `2 * n` (whichever is smaller)
  - `temp_counter` is now in `files_set`
  - `examples` remains unchanged
  - `moves` remains unchanged
  - `len(regulars)` remains unchanged
  - `target` remains `2 * len(examples) + 2`

- After 2 iterations:
  - `i` remains `len(examples) + 1`
  - `temp_counter` becomes `len(examples) + 2` or `2 * n - 1` (whichever is smaller)
  - `temp_counter` is now in `files_set`
  - `examples` remains unchanged
  - `moves` remains unchanged
  - `len(regulars)` remains unchanged
  - `target` remains `2 * len(examples) + 2`

- After 3 iterations:
  - `i` remains `len(examples) + 1`
  - `temp_counter` becomes `len(examples) + 3` or `2 * n - 2` (whichever is smaller)
  - `temp_counter` is now in `files_set`
  - `examples` remains unchanged
  - `moves` remains unchanged
  - `len(regulars)` remains unchanged
  - `target` remains `2 * len(examples) + 2`

From these observations, we can infer that:
- `i` does not change during the loop.
- `temp_counter` increases until it either reaches `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is no longer in `files_set`.
- `examples`, `moves`, `len(regulars)`, and `target` remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
- `i` is `len(examples) + 1`
- `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`
- `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index
- `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`
- `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`**
