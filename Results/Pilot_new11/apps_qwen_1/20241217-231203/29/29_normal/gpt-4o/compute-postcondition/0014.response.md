According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `files`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `files` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `name` is "example"
- `type_` is "1"
- `files` is a list of strings with at least one file (reduced by one)
- `examples` is a list containing "example"
- `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example"

For the loop to execute one more time, `files` must have at least one more element left in it. Since it was stated that `files` had at least one file at the end of the previous iteration and it has been reduced by one, it means there is currently only one file left in the list.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `files` must have at least two files.

State: **`name` is "example", `type_` is "1", `files` is a list of strings with at least two files, `examples` is a list containing "example", `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example"**
