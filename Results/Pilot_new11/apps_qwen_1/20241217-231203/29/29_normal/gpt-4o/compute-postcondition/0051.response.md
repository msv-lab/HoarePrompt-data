Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`

2. The condition to check is: `examples[1]` is not equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`.

3. If the condition is true, then:
   - `moves` will contain the string `'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}'`
   - `temp_counter` will be incremented by 1

4. The line of code in question is:
   ```
   moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')
   ```

Since `i` is 1, this line will append `f'move {examples[1]} {2}'` to `moves`.

Given the initial state and the condition:
- `i` is 1
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`

We need to determine if `examples[1]` is not equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`. However, since the exact value of `examples[1]` is not provided, we can only proceed with the general case.

If `examples[1]` is not equal to `str(temp_counter)`, then:
- `moves` will contain the string `f'move {examples[1]} 2'`
- `temp_counter` will be incremented by 1, making it `2 * n + 3`

If `examples[1]` is equal to `str(temp_counter)`, then:
- `moves` remains unchanged
- `temp_counter` remains `2 * n + 2`

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `examples[1]`, we consider both scenarios. However, the more general and complete answer is when `examples[1]` is not equal to `str(temp_counter)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`; `moves` contains the string `f'move {examples[1]} 2'`**
