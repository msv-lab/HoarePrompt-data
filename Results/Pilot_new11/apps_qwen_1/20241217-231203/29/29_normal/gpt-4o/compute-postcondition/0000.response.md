The code initializes an empty list called `examples`. This does not affect the values of `n` or the contents of the `files` list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, and `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file with its name and type separated by a space, and the type is either "1" for an example test or "0" for a regular test; `examples` is an empty list.**
