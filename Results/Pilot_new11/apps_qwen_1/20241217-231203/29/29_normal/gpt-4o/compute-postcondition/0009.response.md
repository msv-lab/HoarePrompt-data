Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of files.
- `files` is a list of strings with at least one file.
- `examples` is an empty list or includes "example".
- `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example".
- `name` is "example".
- `type_` is "1" if the condition `type_ == '1'` is true, otherwise it remains "txt".

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for file in files:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `files` list. Since `files` is a list with at least one file, the loop can potentially execute again.
2. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - `files`: Since we are iterating over the `files` list, each iteration consumes one file from the list. Therefore, the length of the `files` list will decrease by one with each iteration.
   - `n`: Since `n` represents the number of files, and we consume one file per iteration, `n` will be reduced by one.
   - `examples`: The state of `examples` does not change based on the loop itself.
   - `regulars`: Similarly, the state of `regulars` does not change based on the loop itself.
   - `name`: The state of `name` does not change based on the loop itself.
   - `type_`: The state of `type_` does not change based on the loop itself unless there is additional logic within the loop body.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `files` had at least one element.
2. After processing one file, `files` now has at least one element fewer than before.
3. Therefore, `n` is reduced by one.

### New State:
- `files` is a list of strings with at least one file (reduced by one).
- `n` is reduced by one.
- `examples` remains unchanged.
- `regulars` remains unchanged.
- `name` remains "example".
- `type_` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files minus one; `files` is a list of strings with at least one file (reduced by one); `examples` is an empty list or includes "example"; `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example"; `name` is "example"; `type_` is "1" if the condition `type_ == '1'` is true, otherwise it remains "txt".**
