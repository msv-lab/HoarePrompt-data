Let's break down the given information and determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial Information at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 7
- `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` + 1
- `examples` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
- `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} 18'`
- `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `target` is 18

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(regulars)`.

### Loop Body (Omitted):
We need to focus on the condition and how it affects the variables. The key point here is whether `regulars[i]` matches `target`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Check the Condition for the Current Value of `i` (`i = 7`):**
   - The loop will only continue if `i` is less than `len(regulars)`.
   - Given `len(regulars)` is at least 1, `i` being 7 means the current index is valid.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `len(regulars) - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `8`.

3. **Update Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`temp_counter`, `examples`, `moves`, `target`) are not directly affected by the loop itself, but their values depend on the outcome of the loop body.
   - Since the problem does not specify any change in these variables within the loop body based on the given information, we assume they remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `8`. The other variables (`temp_counter`, `examples`, `moves`, `target`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the problem does not indicate any changes to them within the loop body.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 8, `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` + 1, `examples` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} 18'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is 18**.
