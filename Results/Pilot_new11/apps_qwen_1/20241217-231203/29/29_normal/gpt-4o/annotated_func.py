#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of files, and `files`, which is a list of strings where each string represents a file with its name and type separated by a space, and the type is either "1" for an example test or "0" for a regular test. The function processes the `files` list to separate the example tests and regular tests into two lists, `examples` and `regulars`, respectively. It then arranges the example tests such that their names match their indices plus one, and the regular tests are similarly arranged. The function performs the necessary moves to reorder the files into the correct sequence and returns a list of these moves as `moves`. 

After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows:
- `n` remains unchanged and still represents the number of files.
- `files` remains unchanged and still contains the original list of file names and types.
- `examples` is a list where each element's name matches its index plus one.
- `regulars` is a list where each element's name matches its adjusted index plus the length of the `examples` list.
- `moves` is a list of commands detailing the moves required to rearrange the files into the correct order.

The function handles the following edge cases:
- If an example file's name does not match its index plus one, the function finds a temporary position within the range `[n, 2*n]` that is not occupied by another file, moves the example file to this position, and updates its name accordingly.
- If an example file cannot find a suitable temporary position, it is moved directly to its correct position.
- Similarly, for regular files, if their name does not match their adjusted index plus the length of the `examples` list, the function finds a temporary position within the same range and moves the file there, updating its name.
- If a file cannot find a suitable temporary position, it is moved directly to its correct position.

Any missing functionality in the annotations is included in the summary, ensuring that all possible actions and states are accurately represented.
