Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `reachable` is `True`
   - `n` is the first integer input
   - `k` is the second integer input
   - `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T'
   - `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`
   - `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`
   - `pos` is equal to `T_pos`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop starts from `G_pos` and increments `pos` by `k` until `pos` reaches or exceeds `T_pos + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `pos` is equal to `T_pos`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue, `pos` must be less than `T_pos + 1`.
   - Since `pos` is currently `T_pos`, the next value of `pos` would be `T_pos + k`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if `T_pos + k` is less than or equal to `T_pos + 1`, which simplifies to `k` being 1 (since `T_pos + 1` is the upper bound).

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - `reachable` remains `True`.
   - `n` remains the first integer input.
   - `k` must be 1 for the loop to continue.
   - `line` remains the same.
   - `G_pos` remains the index of the first 'G' in `line`.
   - `T_pos` remains the index of the first 'T' in `line`.
   - `pos` will be updated to `T_pos + k`, which is `T_pos + 1`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`reachable` is `True`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 1, `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, and `pos` is equal to `T_pos + 1`**.
