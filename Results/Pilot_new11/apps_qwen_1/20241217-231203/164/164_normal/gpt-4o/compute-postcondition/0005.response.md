`G_pos` and `T_pos` are swapped. Since `G_pos` was initially greater than `T_pos`, after swapping, `G_pos` will take the value of `T_pos` and `T_pos` will take the value of `G_pos`. The output state is: `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user, `G_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user, `G_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`.**
