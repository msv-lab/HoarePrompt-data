Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. It checks if a grasshopper, starting at the position indicated by 'G', can reach the position indicated by 'T' by jumping `k` positions at a time without hitting any obstacles ('#'). If the grasshopper can reach 'T', the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles the case where 'G' is initially positioned after 'T' by swapping their positions. The function also correctly identifies when the grasshopper hits an obstacle or reaches the target position, and it properly updates the `reachable` variable accordingly. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs such as 'G' or 'T' not being present in the string, or 'G' being equal to 'T', which would result in the grasshopper already being at the target position.**
