Postcondition: **`reachable` is `False`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, and `pos` is the last value it reached before breaking out of the loop (or retains its original value if the loop does not execute)**
