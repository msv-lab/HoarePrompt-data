The code `T_pos = line.index('T')` finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'T' in the string `line`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `line`, but it assigns the index of the first 'T' in `line` to the variable `T_pos`. The output state will include this new information.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user, `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`**
