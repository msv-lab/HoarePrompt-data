The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the execution is simply interrupted at this point. The variables `reachable`, `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and `pos` retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`reachable` is `True`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 1, `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, and `pos` is `T_pos + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
