Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `s[i]` is 'G', then `g` is 1, and `t` is 0 if `s[1]` is 'T' and -1 otherwise. If `s[i]` is 'T', then `t` is 1, and `g` remains as it was initially (which is 0 if `s[1]` is 'G', and -1 otherwise).***
