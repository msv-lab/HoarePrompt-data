Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'G' does not appear), `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'T' does not appear), `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` from index 0 to `n-1`.
- If a character is 'G', the variable `g` is set to the current index, and `g` remains that value for subsequent iterations.
- Similarly, if a character is 'T', the variable `t` is set to the current index, and `t` remains that value for subsequent iterations.
- Once the loop completes, `g` and `t` will hold the indices of the first occurrences of 'G' and 'T', respectively, in the string `s`. If neither 'G' nor 'T' appears in the string, `g` and `t` will remain -1.
- The variable `i` is set to `n` after the last iteration of the loop.
- The conditions for the initial state ensure that `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, and `k` is a valid index within the string `s`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `g` and `t` will be determined based on the first occurrences of 'G' and 'T' in the string `s`, and the final value of `i` will be `n`.
