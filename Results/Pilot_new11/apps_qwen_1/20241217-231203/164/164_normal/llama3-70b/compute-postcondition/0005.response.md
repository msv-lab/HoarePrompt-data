The code assigns the current value of the index `i` to the variable `g`. Since the first character of the string `s` is at index `i` and `i` is initialized to 0, `g` will also be assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is 0, `t` is -1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is 0, `t` is -1, `i` is 0**
