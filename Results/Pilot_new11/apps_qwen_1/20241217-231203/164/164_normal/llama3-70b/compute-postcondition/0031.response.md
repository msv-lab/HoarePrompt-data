The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1. Additionally, the function accepts a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, 'T' represents the target insect, and '#' represents an obstacle. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.

The function returns a value based on whether the grasshopper can reach the target insect in exactly `k` moves, given the positions of obstacles. However, since the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information, we cannot specify it here without additional context.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` and a string representing the layout, and determine if the grasshopper can reach the target insect in exactly `k` moves.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k` (integers), and a string. It returns a value indicating whether the grasshopper can reach the target insect in exactly `k` moves.**
