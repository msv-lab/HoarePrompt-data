According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial values:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already satisfied as `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`).

We increment `i` by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2.

The conditions `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1` remain unchanged, but `n` must still be greater than 0, which is already satisfied.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
