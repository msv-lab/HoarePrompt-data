n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, 'T' represents the target insect, and '#' represents an obstacle. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
