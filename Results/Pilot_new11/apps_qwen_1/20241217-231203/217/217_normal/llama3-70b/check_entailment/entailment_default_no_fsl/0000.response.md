Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the elements are partitioned into sequences `b` and `c`. According to the problem description, we can partition the sequence into any two sequences, not necessarily by taking elements at even and odd indices. The given code sorts the array in descending order and then partitions it into even and odd indexed elements, which does not guarantee the maximum possible value of \(B - C\).

For example, consider the input:
```
4
-10 -20 10 20
```

The expected output should be:
```
40
```

However, the current implementation would sort the array to `[20, 10, -20, -10]` and then partition it as follows:
- \(b = [20, 10]\)
- \(c = [-20, -10]\)

Thus, \(B = 30\) and \(C = -30\), leading to \(B - C = 60\), which is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve trying all possible partitions of the array into two subsets and calculating the maximum difference \(B - C\).
