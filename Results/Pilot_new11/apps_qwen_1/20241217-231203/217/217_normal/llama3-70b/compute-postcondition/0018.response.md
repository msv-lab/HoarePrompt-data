Output State: **`i` is `n`, `b` is the sum of every even-indexed element in `a`, `c` is the sum of every odd-indexed element in `a`, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, each integer in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution:** The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. For each iteration:
  - If `i % 2 == 0`, `b` is incremented by `a[i]`.
  - If `i % 2 != 0`, `c` is incremented by `a[i]`.

- **Final Values:**
  - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` because the loop runs `n` times.
  - `b` will be the sum of all elements at even indices in the list `a`.
  - `c` will be the sum of all elements at odd indices in the list `a`.

- **Initial Conditions:**
  - `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, each integer in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
  - `b` is initialized to 0.
  - `c` is initialized to 0.

This ensures that the final values of `b` and `c` are correctly calculated based on the values in the list `a` according to the given conditions.
