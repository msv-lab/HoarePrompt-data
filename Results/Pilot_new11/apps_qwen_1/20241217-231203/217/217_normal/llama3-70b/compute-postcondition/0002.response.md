The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. Since the initial state of `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and `a` is a list of `n` integers, each integer in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, after sorting in reverse, the list `a` will contain the same integers but in descending order. The values of `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, each integer in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100**
