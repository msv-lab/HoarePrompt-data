`c` is increased by `a[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `a[1]`, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is increased by `a[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is increased by `a[1]`**
