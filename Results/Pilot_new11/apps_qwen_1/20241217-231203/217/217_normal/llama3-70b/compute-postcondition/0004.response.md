Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, each integer in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
   - `b` is 0.
   - `c` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.
   - This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Key Considerations**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `0 ≤ i < n` must be true at the start of each iteration.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0, so the loop will start if `0 < n`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, but the loop will still execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition but may be modified inside the loop.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
