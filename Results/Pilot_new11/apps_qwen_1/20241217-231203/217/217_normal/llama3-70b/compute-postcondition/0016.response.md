The code `c += a[i]` updates the value of `c` by adding `a[i]` to its current value. Given the initial state, we know:

- `i` is 2
- `c` is increased by `a[0]`
- `b` is increased by `a[1]`

Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. We don't have the explicit value of `a[2]`, but we can still represent the change in `c`.

The value of `c` is increased by `a[2]`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must still be greater than 2; `b` is increased by `a[1]`; `c` is increased by `a[2]`**
