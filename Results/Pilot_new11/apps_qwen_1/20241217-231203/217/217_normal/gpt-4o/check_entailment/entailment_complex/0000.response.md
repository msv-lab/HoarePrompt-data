Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the integer `n` and the sequence of integers from standard input as specified.
2. **Calculating Sums**: 
   - The sum of all positive integers (`B`) is calculated using the expression `sum(x for x in a if x > 0)`.
   - The sum of all negative integers (`C`) is calculated using the expression `sum(x for x in a if x < 0)`.
3. **Result Calculation**: The result `B - C` is computed, which is the maximum possible value of `B - C` as per the problem description.
4. **Output**: The result is printed to standard output.

The program correctly partitions the sequence into two subsets (positive and negative) and computes the difference in their sums. This approach ensures that the maximum possible value of `B - C` is achieved because any other partition would result in a smaller or equal difference.

Since the program follows the exact steps required to solve the problem as described, it is correct.
