Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to maximize \(B - C\) by summing the positive numbers and subtracting the sum of the negative numbers. This approach ensures that the maximum possible value of \(B - C\) is achieved because positive numbers contribute positively to \(B\) and negative numbers contribute negatively to \(C\).

- For the input `3 1 -2 0`, the code correctly computes \(B = 1\) and \(C = -2\), resulting in \(B - C = 3\).
- For the input `6 16 23 16 15 42 8`, the code correctly computes \(B = 120\) and \(C = 0\), resulting in \(B - C = 120\).

The code handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as sequences containing only positive or negative numbers, sequences containing zeros, and sequences with a single element. The logic is sound and the output matches the problem description for all provided examples and potential cases.
