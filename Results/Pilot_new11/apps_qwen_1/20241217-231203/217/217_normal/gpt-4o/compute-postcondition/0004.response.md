`result` is assigned the value of `B - C`, where `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`, and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, `B`, and `C` are not directly changed by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `result`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from standard input, `a` is a list of integers inputted and split by spaces; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`; `result` is `B - C`.**
