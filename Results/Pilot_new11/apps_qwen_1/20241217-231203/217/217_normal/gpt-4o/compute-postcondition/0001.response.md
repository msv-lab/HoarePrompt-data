The code reads a sequence of integers from the user input and converts them into a list. The variable `n` was previously set to an integer input from standard input, but its specific value is not known. After executing `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`, the variable `a` is assigned a list of integers, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from standard input, `a` is a list of integers inputted and split by spaces**
