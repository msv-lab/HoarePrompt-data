The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the sequence, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the elements of the sequence. The function does not explicitly return anything, but its behavior is defined by processing this input.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers from standard input, processes the sequence, and does not return a value.**
