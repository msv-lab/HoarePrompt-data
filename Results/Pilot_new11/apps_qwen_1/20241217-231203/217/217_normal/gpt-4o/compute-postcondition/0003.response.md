The code initializes `C` as the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`. The values of `n` and `B` are not affected by this line of code. The previous value of `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`. After executing the line of code, `C` will be updated to the sum of all negative integers in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from standard input, `a` is a list of integers inputted and split by spaces; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`.**
