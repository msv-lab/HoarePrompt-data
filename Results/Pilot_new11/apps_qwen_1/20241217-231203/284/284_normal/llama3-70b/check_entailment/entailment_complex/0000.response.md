Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(num)` is defined to check if a given number `num` is a prime number.
   - The function works correctly according to its logic:
     - It returns `False` immediately if `num` is less than 2.
     - For larger numbers, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If any divisor is found, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
   - For each `m`, it calculates `n * m + 1`.
   - It then uses `func_1` to check if `n * m + 1` is a prime number.
   - As soon as it finds a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime, it prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Guaranteed Existence of a Counterexample**:
   - Since the problem guarantees that there exists at least one `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime, the program is designed to find such an `m` within the given constraints (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).
   - The loop is structured to ensure that if such an `m` exists, the program will find and print it.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output `m` is guaranteed to satisfy the condition that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, and the value of `m` is within the required range (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and will always produce a valid output for any valid input within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct.
