Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version further clarifies the state transitions and the logic flow of the program. Here’s a breakdown of the key points supporting the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer input \( n \) and processes it within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop Iteration**: The program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000, calculating \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checking its primality using the `func_1` function.

3. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. This ensures that if a number is composite, it will be identified correctly.

4. **Break Statement**: The program prints and breaks as soon as it finds a value of \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. This ensures that the program outputs a valid counterexample as required.

5. **Guaranteed Validity**: Given that the problem guarantees the existence of a valid \( m \) for any \( n \), and the program is designed to find such an \( m \), the program will always terminate with a correct output within the constraints.

The annotated version provides clear states and logical transitions, confirming that the program behaves as intended according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
