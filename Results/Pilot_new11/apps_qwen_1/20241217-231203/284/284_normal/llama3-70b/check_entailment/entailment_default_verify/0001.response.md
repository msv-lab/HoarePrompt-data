Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the given hypothesis. The `func_1` function accurately checks whether a number is prime or not. Given any \( n \) in the specified range, the program will iterate through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and use `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is composite. Since the problem guarantees that such an \( m \) exists, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \) that satisfies the condition. The output hints align with the functionality of the program and confirm that it works as intended for the given constraints.
