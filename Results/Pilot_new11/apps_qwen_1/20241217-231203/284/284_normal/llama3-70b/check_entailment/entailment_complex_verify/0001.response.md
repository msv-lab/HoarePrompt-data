Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description. 

- The annotated version confirms that the `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime by ensuring it is not divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of the number. This is evident from the comments in the code.
- The main program iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000, and for each \( m \), it checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a composite number using `func_1`. If it finds such an \( m \), it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.
- Given the problem guarantees that there is always a valid \( m \) for any \( n \) within the specified range, the program will indeed find and print such an \( m \).
- The annotated version supports the correctness of both the `func_1` function and the main logic of the program.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations confirm its correctness.
