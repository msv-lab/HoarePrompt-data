To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.
  - `num` is not divisible by any integer `i`.

### For Loop Condition:
```
for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over integers `i` starting from 2 up to (and including) `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
- The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in this range, the loop will terminate without further iterations.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current` and the current value of `num` as `num_current`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num_current` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, i_current)`.
   - The loop will continue if `i_current < int(num_current ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i_current` must be incremented by 1, i.e., `i_current + 1`.
   - The loop will terminate if `i_current + 1` is greater than or equal to `int(num_current ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `num` should still satisfy the condition of being not divisible by any integer `i` in the new range.

### Adjusted States:
- `num` remains the same because the divisibility condition does not change.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i_current + 1` is the new `i`.
- The condition that `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, i_current + 1)` must still hold.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, and `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, i_current + 1)`**.

Note: Here, `i_current` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i_current + 1` is the value of `i` for the next iteration.
