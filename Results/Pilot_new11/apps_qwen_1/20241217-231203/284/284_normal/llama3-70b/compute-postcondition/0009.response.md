Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\), and `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, i_current + 1]`. If `num % i == 0` holds true for any `i` in the range, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues as before, meaning `num` remains not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, i_current + 1]`.*}*
