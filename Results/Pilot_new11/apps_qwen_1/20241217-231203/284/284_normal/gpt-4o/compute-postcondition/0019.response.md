Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 144.
   - `i` is increased by 6.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i * i <= x`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i * i <= x` holds true.
   - Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 6`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * i <= x` must be true where `i` is now `i_prev + 6`.

4. **Check the Condition:**
   - We need to ensure that `(i_prev + 6) * (i_prev + 6) <= x`.
   - This means that the new value of `i` should satisfy the condition.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `x`, we need to ensure that `i` is such that the loop can still execute.
   - The value of `i` should be adjusted to ensure that `i * i <= x` holds true in the next iteration.
   - Given that `i` was increased by 6 in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` (i.e., `i_prev + 6`) satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the condition `i * i <= x` holds true in the next iteration.

**State:**
- `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 144.
- `i` must be such that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x`.

In summary, the state for the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 144, and `i` must be such that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x`**.
