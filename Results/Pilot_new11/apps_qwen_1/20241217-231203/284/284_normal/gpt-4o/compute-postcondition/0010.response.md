Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i * i <= x`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3.
   - `i` is 5.

3. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - With `i = 5`, we need to check if `5 * 5 <= x`.
   - This simplifies to `25 <= x`.

4. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be greater than or equal to 25.

Since the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x` needing to be at least 25, we can summarize the modified program state as follows:

**State: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x \geq 25\); `i` is 5**
