The code increments the value of `i` by 6. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 5, so `i` becomes 11. All other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2, and \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x \geq 25\); `i` is 11, and \(x \% 5 \neq 0\) and \(x \% 7 \neq 0\)**
