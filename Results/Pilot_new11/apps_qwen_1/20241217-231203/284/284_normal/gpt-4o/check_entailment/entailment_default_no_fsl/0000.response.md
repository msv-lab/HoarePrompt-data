Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. Given any integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \)), the program searches for an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. The function `func_1` accurately determines whether a number is prime based on the provided conditions. Since the code iterates over a range of \( m \) values from 1 to 1000, it is guaranteed to find such an \( m \) if it exists. The logic of checking for non-prime numbers and breaking out of the loop upon finding a suitable \( m \) ensures that the program will output a valid result for every valid input \( n \). Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
