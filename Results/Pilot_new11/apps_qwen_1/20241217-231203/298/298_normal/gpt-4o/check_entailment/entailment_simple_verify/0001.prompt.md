You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in handling cases where the area of the triangle is exactly zero. According to the problem description, if \( \frac{nm}{k} \) results in zero, the program should print "NO". However, the current implementation only checks if the area is not an integer and prints "NO" in that case. This means that if \( \frac{nm}{k} = 0 \), the program will incorrectly proceed to print "YES" followed by coordinates, which violates the problem constraints.

To fix this, you should add a check for when the area is zero and handle it appropriately by printing "NO". Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area) or area == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        print('YES')
        print('0 0')
        if 2 * area <= n:
            print(f'{2 * area} 1')
            print(f'0 1')
        elif 2 * area <= m:
            print(f'1 {2 * area}')
            print(f'1 0')
        else:
            print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
            print(f'0 {m // 2}')

func()
```

With this correction, the program will handle all cases as required by the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.

    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')

                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')

                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, and the area is \((n_input * m_input) / k_input\). If \(2 * area \leq m_input\), the output is `1 0`. Otherwise, the output is `0` followed by `m // 2`.

If \(2 * area \leq n_input\), the output is "0 1". Otherwise, if \(2 * area \leq m_input\), the output is "1 0". Otherwise, the output is "0" followed by `m // 2`.

If `area` is 0, the print statement outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, if \(2 * area \leq n_input\), the output is "0 1". If \(2 * area \leq m_input\) and the previous condition is not met, the output is "1 0". If neither of the above conditions is met, the output is "0" followed by `m // 2`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`. If `area` (which is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`) is not an integer, the print statement 'NO' is executed. If `area` is 0, the print statement outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, if \(2 * area \leq n_input\), the output is "0 1". If \(2 * area \leq m_input\) and the previous condition is not met, the output is "1 0". If neither of the above conditions is met, the output is "0" followed by `m // 2`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
