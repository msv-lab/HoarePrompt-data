Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program now correctly handles all cases as specified:

1. The program checks if the calculated area is an integer. If it is not, it prints "NO" (correct).
2. If the area is zero, it prints "NO" (correct).
3. For non-zero areas, it prints "YES" and then calculates and prints the coordinates of the points forming the triangle with the correct area.

The annotated version clearly shows that the program now adheres to the problem constraints and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is no longer accurate. The program is now correct based on the problem description and the annotations.
