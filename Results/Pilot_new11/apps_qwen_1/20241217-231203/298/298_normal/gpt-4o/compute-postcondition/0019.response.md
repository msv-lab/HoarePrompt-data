The code `print(f'{n} {m // 2}')` does the following:
- It prints the value of `n` followed by the integer division of `m` by 2.
- The integer division of `m` by 2 means that `m` is divided by 2 and the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number.

The initial states are:
- `n` is `n_input`
- `m` is `m_input`
- `k` is `k_input`
- `area` is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`
- The area is not equal to 0
- `2 * area > n` and `2 * area > m`

These conditions do not affect the output of the print statement. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, but `m` is used in the print statement.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, and the print statement outputs `n` followed by `m // 2`.**
