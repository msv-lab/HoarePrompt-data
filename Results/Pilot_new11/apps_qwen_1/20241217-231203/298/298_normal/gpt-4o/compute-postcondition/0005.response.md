The code `area = int(area)` does not change the value of `area` since `area` is already an integer. It simply converts `area` to an integer again, which does not alter its value. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, `area` is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`**
