Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version of the code does not solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Check for Validity**: The code correctly checks if \(nm\) is divisible by \(k\) (i.e., `if n * m % k:`). If not, it prints "NO" and exits. This part is correct.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_3` function calculates the GCD of \(n\) and \(m\) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (via `func_2`). The GCD is stored in `g`.

3. **Triangle Area Condition**: The code checks if \(|n1 * m| \geq g\). This step seems to be checking if the area condition is met, but it is not clear how this relates to forming a triangle with the required area. The variables `n1` and `m1` are derived from the GCD calculation, but their use in the context of forming a triangle is unclear.

4. **Print Statements**: If the condition `abs(n1 * m) >= g` is met, it prints "YES" and provides some points, assuming they form a triangle with the required area. However, the logic to derive these points and ensure they form a triangle with the specified area is missing. The points printed are simply derived from the GCD calculation, which does not guarantee the required area.

5. **Incorrect Logic for Triangle Points**: The points printed (`(0, 0)`, `(0, n1 * m // g)`, `(m1 * m // g, 0)`) do not necessarily form a triangle with the required area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). For example, in the provided input `4 3 3`, the points printed do not form a triangle with the required area.

Given the above analysis, the annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly solve the problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is maintained.
