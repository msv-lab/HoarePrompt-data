Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically:

1. The code checks if \(nm \mod k\) is zero, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of such points. However, it does not verify the area condition properly.
2. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are related to finding the GCD and the coefficients for the equation \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\), but they are not used in a way that addresses the problem of finding points with the specified area.
3. The annotated version shows that the core logic to find the points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) that form a triangle with the area \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is missing. The code provided does not implement any method to achieve this.

Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is accurate, as the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
