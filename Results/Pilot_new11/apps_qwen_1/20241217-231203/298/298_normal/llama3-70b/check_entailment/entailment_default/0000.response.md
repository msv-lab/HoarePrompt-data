Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not always follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the calculated area (`nm / k`) cannot be achieved by forming a triangle with integer coordinates. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangle Area**: The problem requires finding three integer points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly `nm / k`. The code does not explicitly calculate the area of the triangle using the determinant method or any other geometric approach. Instead, it checks if `n * m % k` is zero, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of such points.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the case where `n * m / k` is not an integer. If `nm / k` is not an integer, it is impossible to form a triangle with the required area using integer coordinates. For example, if `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 5`, the area required would be `12 / 5 = 2.4`, which is not an integer. In such cases, the code incorrectly prints "YES" and provides coordinates that do not form a valid triangle.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Validating Points**: Even if `n * m % k` is zero, the code still does not ensure that the points it generates form a valid triangle with the required area. The example provided in the problem description and the output hints suggest that the points need to be chosen carefully to satisfy the area requirement.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
