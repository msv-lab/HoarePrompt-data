Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. Specifically, the approach taken to find the points and the conditions under which it declares a solution is flawed.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD and Point Coordinates**:
   - The `func_3` function calculates \( x \) and \( y \) using the extended Euclidean algorithm. However, it returns \( x \), \( y \), and \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b \), which is the combination of coefficients from the linear Diophantine equation \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).
   - The values of \( x \) and \( y \) are used directly as the coordinates of the points, but this does not guarantee that the area of the triangle formed by these points will be exactly \( \frac{nm}{k} \).

2. **Area Calculation Mismatch**:
   - The area of the triangle is expected to be \( \frac{nm}{k} \). However, the program does not ensure that the area formed by the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) is exactly \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
   - Even if the area condition is met, the coordinates calculated might not satisfy the area requirement due to the nature of the extended Euclidean algorithm and how the points are derived.

3. **General Solution Validation**:
   - The program assumes that if the area condition is met, the points can be constructed in the specified manner. This assumption is not valid because the points need to be within the bounds \([0, n]\) and \([0, m]\), and the area calculation needs to be precise.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
- Ensure that the area condition \( \frac{nm}{k} \) is met.
- Construct points that form a triangle with the exact area \( \frac{nm}{k} \).
- Verify that all points lie within the given bounds.

A more appropriate approach would involve:
1. Checking if \( nm \) is divisible by \( k \).
2. Using specific points that form a triangle with the desired area, ensuring they lie within the bounds.
3. Verifying the area condition accurately.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly follow the problem description and may produce incorrect or invalid solutions.
