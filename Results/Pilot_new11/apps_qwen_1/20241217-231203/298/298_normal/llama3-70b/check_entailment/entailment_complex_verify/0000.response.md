Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment was marked as **False** because it was noted that the provided program consisted only of helper functions and did not implement the main logic required to solve the problem. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the program now includes the necessary logic to determine if the given conditions can be met and, if so, to provide a valid solution.

1. The program checks if the area condition can be satisfied by verifying if \( n \times m \mod k = 0 \). If not, it prints "NO".
2. If the condition is met, it uses the helper functions to compute the necessary coefficients and coordinates for the points.
3. The program correctly calculates the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

Given the annotations and the logic implemented, the program now meets the problem description and provides a valid solution when possible. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to **True**.
