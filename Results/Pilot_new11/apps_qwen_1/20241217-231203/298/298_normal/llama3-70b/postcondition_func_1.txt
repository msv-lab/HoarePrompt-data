The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not being zero). It recursively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the extended Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is zero, it returns the pair `(1, 0)`, which corresponds to the base case where the GCD is `a` and the coefficients `x` and `y` are 1 and 0 respectively. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call with parameters `(b, a % b)` and uses the results to compute the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. The function finally returns these coefficients `y` and `x - a // b * y`. This process ensures that the function returns the correct coefficients for the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, which are valid for the initial values of `a` and `b`.
