The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers representing dimensions `n` and `m` respectively, and another parameter `k`, though `k` is not used within the function. It calls another function `func_2(a, b)` to obtain values `x` and `y`. The function then returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the computed value of `x * a + y * b`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but the function assumes that `a`, `b`, and `k` are positive integers within specified ranges.
