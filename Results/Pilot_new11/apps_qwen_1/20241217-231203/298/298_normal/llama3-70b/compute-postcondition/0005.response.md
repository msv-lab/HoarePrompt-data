The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers where `b` is not zero. The function returns either 1 and 0 in Case_1, or `y` and `x - a // b * y` in Case_2, where `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(b, a % b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not being zero), and return either 1 and 0 or `y` and `x - a // b * y` based on the recursive calls to itself with updated parameters.
