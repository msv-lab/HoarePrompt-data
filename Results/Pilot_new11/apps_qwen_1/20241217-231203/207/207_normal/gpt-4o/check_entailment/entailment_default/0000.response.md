Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. Let's break down the verification:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1(x, y)` function correctly calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. This ensures that the subsequent logic in `func_2(m, a, b)` can properly handle cases where `a` and `b` share a common factor greater than 1.

2. **Recursive Case**: If the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1, the function `func_2(m, a, b)` recursively calls itself with the reduced values (`m // g`, `a // g`, `b // g`) and multiplies the result by `g`. This correctly handles cases where the interval `[0, m]` can be scaled down to a smaller problem due to shared factors.

3. **Simple Arithmetic Case**: If `m < a + b - 1`, the function directly returns \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\). This correctly calculates the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if the interval is small enough.

4. **Combined Summation Case**: For larger intervals (`m >= a + b - 1`), the function calculates the sum of two parts: `sum_k` and `sum_m`. `sum_k` calculates the number of distinct integers reachable within the interval `[0, k]` where `k = a + b - 1`, and `sum_m` calculates the remaining distinct integers beyond `k` up to `m`. This comprehensive calculation ensures that all possible distinct integers within the specified range are accounted for.

Given the detailed logic and the provided output hints, the code accurately implements the solution for the problem description, covering all potential cases without missing any. Thus, the code is correct.
