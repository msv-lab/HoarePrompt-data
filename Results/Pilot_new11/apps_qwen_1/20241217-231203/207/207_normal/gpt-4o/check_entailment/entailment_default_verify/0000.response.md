Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find \( f(i) \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \). The output hints confirm that the function `func_2` handles different cases based on the GCD of `a` and `b`, but it still fails to produce the correct results for various test cases as demonstrated. Specifically, the function does not correctly calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \( i \) within the specified interval, leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
