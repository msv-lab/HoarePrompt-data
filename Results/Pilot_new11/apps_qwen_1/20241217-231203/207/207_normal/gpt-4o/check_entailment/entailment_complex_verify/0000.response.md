Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find \( f(i) \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( m \). 

Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each \( i \). The annotations confirm that the function handles the GCD case correctly, but it does not handle the general case where the frog can reach a range of integers within the interval \([0, x]\). The logic for calculating \( f(i) \) based on the GCD and the combined summation cases is flawed.

For instance, the annotated version shows that when \( m < a + b - 1 \), the function returns \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\), which is incorrect because it does not account for the specific jumps allowed by \( a \) and \( b \). Similarly, the logic for the general case where \( m \geq a + b - 1 \) is also incorrect as it does not properly count the number of distinct reachable integers.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is maintained.
