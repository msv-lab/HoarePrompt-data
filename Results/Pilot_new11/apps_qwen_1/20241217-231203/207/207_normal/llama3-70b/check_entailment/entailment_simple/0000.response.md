Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program calculates the number of ways to reach each position up to \(m\) using steps of \(a\) and \(b\), but it does not compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach, which is what \(f(i)\) represents according to the problem statement.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
1. **Misunderstanding of \(f(i)\):**
   - According to the problem, \(f(i)\) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from 0, constrained within the interval \([0, i]\). However, the provided program calculates the number of ways to reach each position up to \(m\), not the distinct integers reached.
   - For instance, for \(m = 7\), \(a = 5\), and \(b = 3\), the program calculates how many ways there are to reach each position from 0 to 7, but it does not count the distinct integers reachable. The output of the program is not \(f(0) + f(1) + \ldots + f(7)\) as required.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to store the number of ways to reach each position up to \(m\). While this approach is correct for counting the number of ways to reach each position, it does not directly give the number of distinct integers reachable.
   - The `dp` array should instead be used to track the distinct integers reachable at each step, but the current implementation does not do this.

### Example:
For the input `7 5 3`, the expected output is the sum of \(f(0) + f(1) + \ldots + f(7)\), where:
- \(f(0) = 1\)
- \(f(1) = 1\)
- \(f(2) = 1\)
- \(f(3) = 1\)
- \(f(4) = 1\)
- \(f(5) = 3\) (reaches 5, 0, 2, 3, 4)
- \(f(6) = 3\) (reaches 6, 1, 4, 5, 0, 2)
- \(f(7) = 8\) (reaches 7, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0)

The sum is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 8 = 19\).

However, the provided program does not compute this correctly. It calculates the number of ways to reach each position, which is different from the number of distinct integers reachable.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to track the distinct integers reachable at each step. Here's a sketch of how it could be done:

```python
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    distinct_reachable = set()
    distinct_reachable.add(0)
    
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            distinct_reachable.add(i + a)
        if i - b >= 0:
            distinct_reachable.add(i - b)
    
    result = sum(len(distinct_reachable & set(range(i + 1))) for i in range(m + 1))
    print(result)
```

This implementation maintains a set of distinct reachable integers and updates it as the frog makes jumps. Finally, it sums the sizes of the intersection of the set of reachable integers with the set of integers up to \(i\) for each \(i\) from 0 to \(m\).
