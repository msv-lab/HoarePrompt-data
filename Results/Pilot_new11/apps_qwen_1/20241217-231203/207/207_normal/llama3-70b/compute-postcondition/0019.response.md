Postcondition: ***`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`, and `dp` is a list where the first element is either 1 or 2 and the remaining elements are 0. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i]` is updated by adding `dp[i - b]` to its current value. Otherwise, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
