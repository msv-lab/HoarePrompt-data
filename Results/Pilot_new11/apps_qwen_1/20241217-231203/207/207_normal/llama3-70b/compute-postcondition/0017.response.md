Postcondition: ***`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`, `dp` is a list where the first element is either 1 or 2 and the remaining elements are 0. If `(i + a) - b` is greater than or equal to 0, the first element of `dp` is updated to either 1 or 2 (depending on the original value), and `dp[i + a - b]` is incremented by `dp[i - b]`. Otherwise, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.***
