The code `m, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `m`, `a`, and `b`. Since the input is not specified, let's denote the input integers as `input_m`, `input_a`, and `input_b`. After this operation, `m`, `a`, and `b` will hold these values.

The initial states are:
- `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\)
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\)

After executing the code, the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` will be updated to the input values, and the initial conditions will no longer apply directly since the values are now specific inputs. However, we can still express the conditions in terms of the new values.

Output State: **`m` is `input_m`, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b` where `1 \leq input_m \leq 10^9`, `1 \leq input_a \leq 10^5`, `1 \leq input_b \leq 10^5`**
