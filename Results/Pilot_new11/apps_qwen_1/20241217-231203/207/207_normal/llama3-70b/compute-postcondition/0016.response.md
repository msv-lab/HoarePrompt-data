Let's analyze the given Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is `input_a`.
- `b` is `input_b`.
- `dp` is a list where the first element is either 1 or 2 and the remaining elements are 0.
- If `(i + 1) - b` is greater than or equal to 0, the first element of `dp` becomes either 1 or 2 (depending on the original value), and `dp[i + 1]` is incremented by `dp[i + 1 - b]`. Otherwise, the state of `dp` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
dp[i + a] += dp[i]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables Affected:**
   - `dp[i + a]` is being updated by adding `dp[i]` to it.

2. **Check the Precondition:**
   - Since the precondition does not specify the exact values of `i`, `a`, and `dp`, we need to consider the general case.

3. **Update the Value of `dp[i + a]`:**
   - `dp[i + a]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `dp[i + a]` is updated to `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.
- No other variables are affected by this line of code.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`, `dp` is a list where the first element is either 1 or 2 and the remaining elements are 0, `dp[i + a]` is incremented by `dp[i]`.**

This is the final state after executing the given line of code.
