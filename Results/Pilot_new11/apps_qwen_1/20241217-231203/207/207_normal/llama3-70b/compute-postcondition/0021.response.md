The code `print(sum(dp))` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `dp`. The list `dp` is defined such that the first element `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0. The variable `sum(dp)` computes the sum of these elements, which will be 1 since only the first element is 1 and the rest are 0.

The print statement does not change the values of any variables but outputs the sum of `dp`, which is 1. The states of the other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`) are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`, `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining elements are 0, and the sum of `dp` is printed as 1.**
