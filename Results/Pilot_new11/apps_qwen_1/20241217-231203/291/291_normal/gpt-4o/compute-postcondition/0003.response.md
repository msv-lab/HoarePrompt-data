`segments_needed` is assigned the value of `2 * (a + b)`. Given that `a` is 1 and `b` is `n`, the value of `segments_needed` becomes `2 * (1 + n)`, which simplifies to `2 + 2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is 1, `b` is `n`, `segments_needed` is `2 + 2 * n`**
