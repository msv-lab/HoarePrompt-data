First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State:
  - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
  - `a` is 4
  - `b` is \((n + 3) // 4\)
  - `min_segments_needed` is \(2 + 2 * n\)

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
  ```

Let's calculate the value of `b` based on the initial state:
- `b = (n + 3) // 4`

Now, we substitute the values into the code snippet:
- `segments_needed = 2 * (a + b) = 2 * (4 + (n + 3) // 4) = 8 + 2 * ((n + 3) // 4)`

Since the values of `a` and `min_segments_needed` are not changed by the code, they remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `a` is 4; `b` is \((n + 3) // 4\); `min_segments_needed` is \(2 + 2 * n\); `segments_needed` is \(8 + 2 * ((n + 3) // 4)\)**
