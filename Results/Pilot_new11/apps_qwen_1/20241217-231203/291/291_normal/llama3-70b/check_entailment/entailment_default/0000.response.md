Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of segments that Sofia has to draw with a ruler. Let's analyze the problem:

- To draw \( n \) squares, each square requires 4 segments.
- Initially, drawing the first square requires 4 segments (2 with a ruler and 2 guided).
- For each additional square, only 2 new segments need to be drawn with a ruler (one vertical and one horizontal).

The formula provided in the code, `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`, does not correctly represent this logic. Instead, the correct formula should be:

\[ \text{segments} = 2 + 2(n - 1) \]

This formula accounts for the initial 2 segments needed for the first square and then adds 2 more segments for each additional square.

Let's test the code with a few examples to confirm:

1. **Input: 1**
   - Expected Output: 2 (Initial 2 segments for the first square)
   - Actual Output: 2
   - This is correct.

2. **Input: 2**
   - Expected Output: 4 (Initial 2 segments for the first square + 2 more segments for the second square)
   - Actual Output: 3
   - This is incorrect. The correct output should be 4.

Since the code fails for \( n = 2 \), it is clear that the code does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of segments that Sofia has to draw with a ruler. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
