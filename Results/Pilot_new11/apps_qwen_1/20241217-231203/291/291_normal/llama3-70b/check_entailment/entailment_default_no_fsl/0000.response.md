Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler. The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` does not accurately reflect the problem description. Specifically, for `n = 1`, the output should be `2`, but for other values of `n`, the formula does not match the expected behavior.

For example, when `n = 2`, the expected output is `3` because Sofia needs to draw 3 segments initially (one vertical and two horizontal or vice versa) and then use those as guides to draw the remaining segments. However, the code outputs `4` using the formula `2 * (2.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.

Similarly, for `n = 4`, the expected output is `4` because Sofia can draw 4 segments initially (2 vertical and 2 horizontal or a different combination) and then use those as guides. But the code incorrectly outputs `6` using the formula `2 * (4.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
