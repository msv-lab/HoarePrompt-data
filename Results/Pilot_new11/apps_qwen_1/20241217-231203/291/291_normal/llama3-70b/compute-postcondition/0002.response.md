The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition involving the integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. However, since no specific condition or return value is provided in the output, we cannot determine what exactly the function returns without additional information.

Given the constraints, the function likely involves checking the value of `n` and returning a specific result based on its value. But without explicit details, we can only state the parameter constraint and the range for `n`.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.**
