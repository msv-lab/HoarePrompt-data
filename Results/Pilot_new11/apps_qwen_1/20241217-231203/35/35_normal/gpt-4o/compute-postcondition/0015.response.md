`low` is reassigned to `mid + 1`. From the initial state, `mid` is defined as `low + high` divided by 2. Since `low` is not its original value or `high` is greater than `low` when `low` is its original value, the new value of `low` will be `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `low` and retains the relationship between `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`low` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2, `high` must be greater than `low` if `low` is its original value**
