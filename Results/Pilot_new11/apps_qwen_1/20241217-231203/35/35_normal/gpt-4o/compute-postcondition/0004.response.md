The code `low = mid + 1` assigns the value of `mid + 1` to the variable `low`. Given that `mid` is initially 1, the new value of `low` will be `1 + 1`, which is 2. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `high`, and `can_distribute(mid)` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is 2, `high` is 2, `mid` is 1, and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns True**
