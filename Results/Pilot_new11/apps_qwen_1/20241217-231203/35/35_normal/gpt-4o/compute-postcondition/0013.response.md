To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low < high`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `low` is either its original value or `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
   - `high` is either its original value or `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `mid` is always `(low + high) // 2`.

Given that `low` and `high` can take on values based on their original values or intermediate values calculated during the loop, we need to ensure that the condition `low < high` holds true.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to continue, `low` must be strictly less than `high`.
- If `low` is at its original value and `high` is at its original value, the loop might terminate if `low` reaches `high`.
- If `low` has incremented (i.e., `low = (low + high) // 2 + 1`), then `high` must still be greater than this new value of `low`.

### Possible Adjustments:
1. **Ensure `low` is not equal to `high`**: This means either `low` should not be at its original value, or if it is, `high` should be adjusted to ensure `low < high`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `low` is not equal to `high` or ensure that if `low` is at its original value, `high` is adjusted to be greater than this original `low` value.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `low` must be strictly less than `high`. Therefore, `low` cannot be at its original value unless `high` is adjusted to be greater than this original `low` value.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`low` is not its original value or if `low` is its original value, `high` must be greater than `low`**.

This ensures that `low < high` holds true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
