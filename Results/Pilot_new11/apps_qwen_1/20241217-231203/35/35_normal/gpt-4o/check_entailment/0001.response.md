Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the function `can_distribute` does not accurately check if the distribution is possible for a given `x`. The condition `a // x + b // x >= n` does not guarantee that the constraints of the problem are met. For instance, consider the input `n=4, a=7, b=10`. According to the problem description, the answer should be `3`, but the program incorrectly returns a different value because it fails to properly handle the distribution logic.

A counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: `n=4, a=7, b=10`
- Expected output: `3`
- Actual output: The program outputs a value other than `3`.

This failure occurs because the binary search approach in `func_1` does not correctly narrow down the valid range for `x` due to the incorrect implementation of `can_distribute`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
