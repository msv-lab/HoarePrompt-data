Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using binary search to find the maximum possible number \(x\) such that each plate will contain at least \(x\) pieces of cake. However, there are edge cases that the current implementation does not handle correctly.

Consider the following input:
```
n = 4
a = 2
b = 3
```

According to the problem description, we need to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate. In this case, the total number of pieces is \(a + b = 2 + 3 = 5\). With 4 plates, the minimum number of pieces per plate should be at least \(\lceil \frac{5}{4} \rceil = 2\).

However, the `can_distribute` function checks if \(a // x + b // x \geq n\). For \(x = 2\):
- \(a // 2 = 1\)
- \(b // 2 = 1\)
- \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is less than \(n = 4\)

This means that \(x = 2\) cannot be distributed. However, since \(x = 1\) satisfies the condition (\(a // 1 + b // 1 = 2 + 3 = 5 \geq 4\)), the program should return \(x = 1\).

But the binary search implementation in `func_1` returns \(x = 0\) because the loop does not correctly handle the boundary conditions. Specifically, when `mid` is 1, the `can_distribute` function returns true, but the loop does not update `low` correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this and other similar cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
