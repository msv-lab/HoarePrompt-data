Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) from standard input, ensuring they are within the specified constraints \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 100 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \).

2. **Initialization**: The variable `x` is initialized to the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`. This is a good starting point because the maximum possible value of `x` cannot exceed the smallest of these three values.

3. **Loop Logic**: The program uses a while loop to decrement `x` until the condition \( a \geq x \) and \( b \geq x \) and \( a - x + (b - x) \geq x \) is satisfied. This condition ensures that:
   - Each cake can be distributed without running out of pieces.
   - The remaining pieces of both cakes together can still meet the requirement that each plate gets at least `x` pieces.

4. **Termination**: The loop breaks once the above condition is met, ensuring that `x` is the largest possible value satisfying all conditions.

5. **Output**: The program prints the value of `x`, which is the maximum number of pieces each plate can have while meeting all the given conditions.

Since the program correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary constraints, it is correct.
