Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers. If the condition `a >= x` and `b >= x` and `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)` is met, then the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` remains the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition under the if condition is also the overall postcondition of the if-else block.***
