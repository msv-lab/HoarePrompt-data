The code `x = min(n, a, b)` assigns the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b` to the variable `x`. This means that `x` will take on the smallest value from the three integers entered by the user. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`**.
