Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Initial State**: 
   - After the previous iteration, `a` is the original value of `b`.
   - `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `while b:`. This means the loop continues as long as `b` is non-zero.

3. **Determine the State Needed for Another Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero. If `b` is zero, the loop will terminate because the condition `b` is false.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, for `b` to be non-zero, the original `a` must have had a non-zero remainder when divided by the original `b`.

Based on this reasoning, we need to adjust the state such that `b` is non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is the original value of `b`; `b` must be non-zero.**
