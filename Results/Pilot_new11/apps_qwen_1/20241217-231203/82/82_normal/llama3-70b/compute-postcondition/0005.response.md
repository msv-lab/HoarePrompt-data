The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` must be non-zero. After executing the code:

- `a` is assigned the value of `b`.
- `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, which is the remainder when `a` (the original value of `b`) is divided by `b`.

Given these changes, the updated values are:
- `a` becomes `b`.
- `b` becomes `a % b`, which is the remainder when the original `b` is divided by itself, resulting in 0.

However, since the initial condition states that `b` must be non-zero, the operation `a % b` cannot actually make `b` zero unless `a` (which is the original `b`) is also zero. But given the condition that `b` must be non-zero, this operation does not violate the condition.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is the original value of `b`; `b` is 0**.
