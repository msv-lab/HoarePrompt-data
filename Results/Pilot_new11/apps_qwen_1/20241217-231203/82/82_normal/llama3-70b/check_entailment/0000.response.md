Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and `func_2` computes the least common multiple (LCM) using the relationship between GCD and LCM.

However, these functions are not used to solve the problem. The task requires finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. The provided code does not implement this logic.

For example, consider the input:
- Input: `6 10`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: The program does not produce any output because it does not contain the necessary logic to find the optimal \( k \).

To solve the problem correctly, the program should implement a logic to find the smallest \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. This involves iterating over possible values of \( k \) and calculating the LCM for each pair until the minimum LCM is found.
