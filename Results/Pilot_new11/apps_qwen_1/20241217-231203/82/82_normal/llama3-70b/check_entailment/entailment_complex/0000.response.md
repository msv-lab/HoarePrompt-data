Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case when the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is greater than \(a + b\). Specifically, the solution assumes that the minimum LCM will be achieved by incrementing \(k\) until the LCM is minimized, starting from \(k = 0\). However, this approach does not guarantee finding the smallest \(k\) in cases where the optimal \(k\) is greater than \(0\).

Consider the following example:

- Input: \(a = 10\), \(b = 15\)

The GCD of 10 and 15 is 5. The LCM of \(10 + 0\) and \(15 + 0\) is 30. The LCM of \(10 + 1\) and \(15 + 1\) is 33, and so on. The LCM of \(10 + 5\) and \(15 + 5\) is 25, which is smaller than 30. However, the current implementation will only check up to \(k = 0\) before breaking out of the loop, thus missing the optimal \(k = 5\).

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that it checks for the smallest \(k\) that minimizes the LCM, even if it starts from a higher value. This can be done by checking a wider range of \(k\) values or by a more systematic approach to find the minimum LCM.
