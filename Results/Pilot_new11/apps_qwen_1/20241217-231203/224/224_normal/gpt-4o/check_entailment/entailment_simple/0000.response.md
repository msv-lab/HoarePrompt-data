Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires counting the number of permutations \(p\) of integers \(1, 2, \ldots, n\) such that \(f(p)\) equals \(f_{max}(n)\), where \(f(p)\) is defined based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the prefix sums of the permutation.

To meet the problem requirements, the program needs to:
1. Calculate \(f_{max}(n)\), which is the maximum number of distinct values among the GCDs of prefixes of all permutations of \(1, 2, \ldots, n\).
2. Count the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value of \(f(p)\).

The current implementation only calculates the factorial of \(n-1\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which does not address the core problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary operations to solve the given problem.
