The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `result`. The initial value of `n` and `mod` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `result` and retains the original values of `n` and `mod`.

Output State: **`result` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and `mod` is an integer representing 10^9 + 7.**
