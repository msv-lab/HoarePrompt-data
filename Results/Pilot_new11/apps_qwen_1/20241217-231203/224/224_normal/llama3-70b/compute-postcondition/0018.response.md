Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1)) \% 10\), where \(\text{sum}(k)\) is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `k`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop runs in reverse order: `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1)`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body contains the line `dp[j] %= MOD`.
   - This line updates `dp[j]` to be the last digit (i.e., modulo 10) of its original value.

4. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state just before the loop starts its next iteration.

5. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `f_max_n` down to 1.
   - In each iteration, `j` decreases by 1.
   - After each iteration, `dp[j]` is updated to be the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1))\).

6. **Next Iteration State**:
   - At the start of the current iteration, `j` is some value `k` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the start of the current iteration).
   - After executing the loop body, `dp[k]` is updated to the last digit of \((\text{sum}(k) + \text{sum}(k - 1))\).
   - The loop continues until `j` reaches 1.

7. **Final Adjustment**:
   - To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to ensure `j` is decremented by 1 and adjust the `dp[j]` values accordingly.
   - Since the loop is in reverse, the next `j` value will be `k - 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1))\).

Therefore, the output state for the next iteration is:
**`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1))\).**
