The code snippet updates the `dp` array such that `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`. This operation modifies each element in the `dp` array starting from index 1 up to `f_max_n - 1`. The initial state for `dp[j]` is defined as the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\). After this increment operation, `dp[j]` will now be the sum of the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\) and `dp[j - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\).

After executing the line `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` for each `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, the updated state of the `dp` array is such that each `dp[j]` is the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]` (which is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\)).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\) and each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`.**
