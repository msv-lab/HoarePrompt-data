Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - For all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   The loop is defined as:
   ```
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.
   - Each iteration of the loop does not change `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, or `dp[0]`.
   - The value of `dp[j]` for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` remains unchanged within the loop.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1, at the start of the first iteration of the loop, `i` is 1.
   - After the first iteration, `i` becomes 2.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1 (at the start of the first iteration), after each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to reach `n`.

6. **Final State Calculation**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was 1 at the start of the first iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the second iteration.
   - Generally, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `n` remains within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
- `f_max_n` remains a positive integer.
- `MOD` remains 10.
- `dp[0]` remains 1.
- For all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` remains the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

If `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10, `i` is `i + 1**.
