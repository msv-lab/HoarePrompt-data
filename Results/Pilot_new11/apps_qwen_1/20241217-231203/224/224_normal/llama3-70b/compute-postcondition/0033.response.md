The code snippet updates `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it and then taking the result modulo 10. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp[0]` is 1
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `f_max_n - 3`

Initially, `dp[j]` is already updated to the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `f_max_n - 3`. The line of code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` means that `dp[j]` is incremented by the value of `dp[j - 1]` and then taken modulo 10.

Since `j` is `f_max_n - 3`, `j - 1` would be `f_max_n - 4`. Thus, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1] % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 3`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]` and then taken modulo 10**
