The code snippet updates the `dp` list such that each element `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`. Given that initially `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, this means that `dp[j]` will be the sum of `dp[0]` up to `dp[j-1]`.

Let's consider the initial state:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[0]` which is 1

After executing the line `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` for each `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, the `dp` list will look like this:
- `dp[0]` remains 1
- `dp[1]` will be `dp[0]` (which is 1) added to itself, so `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` will be `dp[1]` (which is 1) added to itself, so `dp[2]` is 2
- and so on...

Therefore, `dp[j]` will be `j` for all `j` from 0 to `f_max_n`.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` being 1 and `dp[j]` being `j` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`.**
