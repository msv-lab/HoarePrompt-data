The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments `dp[j]` by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Given the initial conditions, we know the following:

- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is calculated as the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and then each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`, all `dp[j]` values are taken modulo 10.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements.

Since the code snippet only affects `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it, the values of `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp[0]`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the updated `dp[j]` values.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` plus the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j-1`, and each `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of the previous `dp[j - 1]` and the initial value of `dp[j]`, all `dp[j]` values are taken modulo 10; `i` is 2; `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements; for each `j`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`.**
