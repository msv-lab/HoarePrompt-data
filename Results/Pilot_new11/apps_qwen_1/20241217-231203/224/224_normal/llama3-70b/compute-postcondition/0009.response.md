After the line `dp[j] %= MOD` is executed, each element in the `dp` list is taken modulo `MOD`, which is 10. This means that the value of `dp[j]` is updated to its remainder when divided by 10.

Given the initial state:
- `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` is `dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) % 10`.

Now, applying the modulo operation:
- `dp[1]` was updated to `2`, so `dp[1] % 10 = 2`.
- `dp[2]` was updated to `4`, so `dp[2] % 10 = 4`.
- This pattern continues, and each `dp[j]` is updated to its remainder when divided by 10.

Thus, after executing `dp[j] %= MOD`, the updated values of `dp[j]` remain the same since they are all less than 10.

The Output State is:
**`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[j]` is `dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) % 10` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, and each `dp[j]` is taken modulo 10**.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[j]` is `dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) % 10` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`**.
