Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\).

2. **Loop Details:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value between 2 and `f_max_n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `j - 1`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - Since `j` is being decremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `f_max_n - 1`.
   - All other states (`n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp[0]`, and `dp[j]` for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp[0]` is 1.
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\).

State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1])\)**
