The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. Given that `MOD` is 10, `dp[j]` will now hold the value of `dp[j] % 10`.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp[0]` is 1
- For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1)) \% 10\), where \(\text{sum}(k)\) is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `k`.

After executing `dp[j] %= MOD`, the value of `dp[j]` will be updated to be the last digit (i.e., modulo 10) of its original value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1))\).**
