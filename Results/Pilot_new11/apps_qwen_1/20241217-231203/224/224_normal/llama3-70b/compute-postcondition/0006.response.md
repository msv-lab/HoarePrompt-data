`dp[j]` is assigned the value of `dp[j] % MOD`. This means that each element in the `dp` list, which was previously set to `j` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, will now be taken modulo `10`. Since `dp[0]` was already set to 1 and does not involve any calculation, it remains unchanged. The updated values for `dp[j]` for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` will be the result of `j % 10`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, and `dp[j]` is `j % 10` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`.
