In the given code snippet, `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[j]`. The previous value of `dp[j]` is stored, and then it is updated. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Previous State**:
   - `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1)) \% 10\), where \(\text{sum}(k)\) is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `k`.

2. **Effect of the Code Snippet**:
   - The loop runs in reverse order: `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1)`.
   - Inside the loop, `dp[j]` is updated to include the value of `dp[j - 1]`.

3. **Impact on `dp[j]`**:
   - For the current value of `j`, `dp[j]` is updated to be the last digit of \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1))\).
   - After the update, `dp[j]` is further adjusted by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The new value of `dp[j]` is \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1]) \% 10\).

5. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` remains a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1.
   - `MOD` remains 10.
   - `dp[0]` remains 1.
   - For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is now \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1]) \% 10\).

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1]) \% 10\).**
Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is \((\text{sum}(j) + \text{sum}(j - 1) + dp[j - 1]) \% 10\).**
