The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and returns the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` starting from `func_1(0, 1)` up to `func_1(...(func_1(0, 1)...), n)`. After the function concludes, the program state includes `res` containing the maximum value calculated through these iterations, `i` set to `n`, and `n` remaining unchanged within its specified range. This process involves initializing `res` to 0 and then updating it within a loop that runs from 1 to `n`, where each iteration updates `res` with the result of `func_1(res, i)` if `func_1(res, i)` is greater than the current `res`.

The function handles the edge case where `n` is at its minimum value (2) by ensuring the loop still runs correctly. There are no explicitly mentioned missing functionalities based on the provided code, but it assumes `func_1` is defined and behaves as expected for the given inputs.
