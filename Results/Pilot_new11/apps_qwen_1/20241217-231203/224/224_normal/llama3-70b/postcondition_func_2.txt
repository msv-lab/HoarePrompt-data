The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`. The function calculates and returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `f_max_n` modulo 10. 

After the function executes, the following state will be achieved:
- `dp` is an array of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0, with `dp[0]` set to 1.
- For all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10.
- The function returns `dp[f_max_n]`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\) and `f_max_n` is a positive integer. If `f_max_n` is 0, the function will still initialize `dp[0]` to 1, but `dp[j]` for all `j > 0` will remain 0 since the loop will not execute. Thus, `dp[f_max_n]` would be 0 in this case.
- The function correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow, ensuring the result is within the range 0 to 9.
- The function iterates over `j` in reverse order (from `f_max_n` to 1) in the inner loop, which is necessary to correctly compute the cumulative sums.
