You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers, where a >= b > 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables `a` and `b`.
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    ##### Initial State:
    #- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers where \( a \geq b > 0 \).
    #
    ##### First Iteration:
    #- Loop condition: `b != 0`
    #- Update: `a, b = b, a % b`
    #- After first iteration:
    #  - `a` becomes the original value of `b`
    #  - `b` becomes `a % b` which is 0 because `a` is now `b` and `b` was originally less than `a`
    #
    ##### Second Iteration:
    #- For the second iteration, the condition `b` must still be non-zero, but since `b` became 0 after the first iteration, this iteration does not occur.
    #- Therefore, the loop terminates after the first iteration.
    #
    #### Output State After the Loop Executes Some Number of Times:
    #
    #Given the loop behavior, we can generalize the output state as follows:
    #
    #- The loop will execute exactly once when `b` is non-zero.
    #- After one iteration, `a` will be the original value of `b`, and `b` will be 0.
    #
    #Since the loop condition is `b`, and it will only execute if `b` is non-zero, the final state will always be that `b` is 0.
    #
    #### General Output State:
    #- `a` will be the original value of `b`.
    #- `b` will be 0.
    #
    #Thus, the output state of the loop is:
    #
    #**Output State: `a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is 0.**
    return a
    #a is the original value of `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is a positive integer. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At the end, `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to zero. The function returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD of the original inputs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is the maximum value obtained by applying `func_1` iteratively from `func_1(0, 1)` up to `func_1(...(func_1(0, 1)...), n)`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
    return res
    #The program returns res which is the maximum value obtained by applying func_1 iteratively from func_1(0, 1) up to func_1(...(func_1(0, 1)...), n), where i = n and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and returns the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` starting from `func_1(0, 1)` up to `func_1(...(func_1(0, 1)...), n)`. After the function concludes, the program state includes `res` containing the maximum value calculated through these iterations, `i` set to `n`, and `n` remaining unchanged within its specified range. This process involves initializing `res` to 0 and then updating it within a loop that runs from 1 to `n`, where each iteration updates `res` with the result of `func_1(res, i)` if `func_1(res, i)` is greater than the current `res`.

The function handles the edge case where `n` is at its minimum value (2) by ensuring the loop still runs correctly. There are no explicitly mentioned missing functionalities based on the provided code, but it assumes `func_1` is defined and behaves as expected for the given inputs.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and f_max_n is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10, `i` is `n`, `j` is `f_max_n`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #`The program returns dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to f_max_n modulo 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`. The function calculates and returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `f_max_n` modulo 10. 

After the function executes, the following state will be achieved:
- `dp` is an array of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0, with `dp[0]` set to 1.
- For all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10.
- The function returns `dp[f_max_n]`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\) and `f_max_n` is a positive integer. If `f_max_n` is 0, the function will still initialize `dp[0]` to 1, but `dp[j]` for all `j > 0` will remain 0 since the loop will not execute. Thus, `dp[f_max_n]` would be 0 in this case.
- The function correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow, ensuring the result is within the range 0 to 9.
- The function iterates over `j` in reverse order (from `f_max_n` to 1) in the inner loop, which is necessary to correctly compute the cumulative sums.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
