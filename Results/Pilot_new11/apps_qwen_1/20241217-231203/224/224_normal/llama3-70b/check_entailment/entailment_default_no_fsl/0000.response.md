Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the implementation of `func_3` does not accurately count the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \).

The function `func_3` calculates a cumulative sum in a way that does not correspond to the problem's requirements. The cumulative sum approach in `func_3` is intended to calculate something related to combinatorial counts, but it does not properly account for the permutations that achieve the maximum value of \( f(p) \).

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the example with \( n = 6 \). The correct output should be 120, as provided in the problem statement. However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not produce this result.

Here is a brief outline of why the current implementation is incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cumulative Sum**: The function `func_3` computes a cumulative sum, which does not directly translate to the number of permutations with the desired property.
2. **Lack of Permutation Handling**: The function does not explicitly handle the permutations and their properties in a way that aligns with the problem statement.
3. **Incorrect Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is correctly applied to avoid overflow, the overall logic is flawed in counting the valid permutations.

A correct solution would involve more complex combinatorial logic to count the permutations that achieve the maximum \( f(p) \) value, which the current implementation does not provide. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
