The code prints the values of `row` and `col`. According to the initial state:

- `row` is calculated as `n - full_rows`.
- `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`.
- `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`.
- `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows % 2 == 0` or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 != 0`.

After executing `print(row, col)`, the values of `row` and `col` are printed, but the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `full_rows`, `remaining_steps`, and the expression for `col` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a value in the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is `n - full_rows`, `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows % 2 == 0` or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 != 0`, and `row, col` are printed.**
