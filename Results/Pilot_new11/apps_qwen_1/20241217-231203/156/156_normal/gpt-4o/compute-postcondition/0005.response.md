`remaining_steps` is assigned the value of `k % (m - 1)`. Given that `k` is in the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`, `remaining_steps` will be a non-negative integer less than `m - 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `full_rows`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a value in the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`**
