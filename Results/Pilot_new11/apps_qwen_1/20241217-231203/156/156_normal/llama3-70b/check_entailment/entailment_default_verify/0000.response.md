Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not handle the case where `k` falls within the range `[n-1, n*2-3]` correctly. According to the output hints, for this range, the correct calculation should be based on the movement pattern described in the problem statement. However, the current implementation of the program uses an incorrect formula, leading to incorrect outputs for certain values of `k`. For example, when `n=4`, `m=3`, and `k=8`, the program incorrectly prints `(3, 1)` instead of the correct position `(3, 2)`. This indicates that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description and the provided output hints.
