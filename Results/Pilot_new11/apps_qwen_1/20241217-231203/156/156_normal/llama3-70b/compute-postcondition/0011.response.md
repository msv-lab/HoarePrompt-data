The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints given, it seems the function should handle values `n`, `m`, and `k` internally, where `n` and `m` are even and positive integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\).

The output of the function is not specified directly in the code, but we need to consider the typical behavior based on the constraints.

Given the constraints, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but internally handles values `n`, `m`, and `k` where `n` and `m` are even and positive integers within the range \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\). The function does not return anything directly from the given code snippet, so the return value is not explicitly defined.**

However, based on the typical problem context involving these parameters, it might involve some computation or check related to these values, but without further details, we stick to the given information.
