The code snippet updates the value of `k` to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and then prints `k + 1` and `1`. Since `k` is less than `n - 1` and `n` is an even and positive integer, `k * 2 - 2` will also be less than `n * 2 - 2`. Therefore, `k % (n * 2 - 2)` will be equal to `k` because `k` is already less than `n * 2 - 2`.

Thus, `k` remains unchanged, and the code prints `k + 1` and `1`. Given that `k` is less than `n - 1`, `k + 1` will be between `1` and `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `m` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n - 1\); `k` + 1 and `1` are printed.**
