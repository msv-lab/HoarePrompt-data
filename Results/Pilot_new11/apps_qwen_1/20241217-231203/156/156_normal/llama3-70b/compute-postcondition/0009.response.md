Postcondition: ***`n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `m` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\) and `k` is updated to be `k % (n * 2 - 2)\), and `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and the output is determined as follows:
- If \( k < n * 2 - 2 \), the output consists of two numbers: \( 2n - k - 2 \) and \( (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1 \).
- If \( k \geq n * 2 - 2 \), the output is 1 and 2.***
