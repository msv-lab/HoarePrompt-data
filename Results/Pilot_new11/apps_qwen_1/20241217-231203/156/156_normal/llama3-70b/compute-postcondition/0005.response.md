Postcondition: ***`n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `m` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\). `k` has been updated to be `k % (n * 2 - 2)` and its current value is less than `n * 2 - 2`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`***
