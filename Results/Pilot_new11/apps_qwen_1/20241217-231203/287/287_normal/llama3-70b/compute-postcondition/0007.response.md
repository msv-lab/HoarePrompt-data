`res` is initially set to 2 because there exists an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` and `i * i == n`. The code `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. Therefore, `res` will now be `1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `res` is 1 because there exists an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` and `i * i == n`.**
