`res` is decremented by 1. Initially, `res` is 3 if `n` is not 4 and 1 if `n` is 4. After decrementing, `res` will be 2 if `n` is not 4 and 0 if `n` is 4. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `res` is 2 if `n` is not 4 and 0 if `n` is 4.**
