The `print(res)` statement simply outputs the value of `res`. It does not change the value of `res` or any other variables. Therefore, the value of `res` remains unchanged from its previous state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and `res` is the sum of 2 for each divisor of `n`, adjusted by subtracting 1 if `n` is a perfect square.**
