`res` is decremented by 1. If `n` is 4, then `res` was initially 3. After decrementing, `res` becomes 2. If `n` is not even (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`), then `res` remains 1 because there exists an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` and `i * i == n`, and `i` is 2.

Since the initial conditions specify that if `n` is 4, `res` is 3, and if `n` is not even, `res` remains 1, we need to consider both cases:

- If `n` is 4, then `res` becomes 2.
- If `n` is not 4 and not even, `res` remains 1.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `n`:
- If `n` is 4, `res` is 2.
- If `n` is not 4 and not even, `res` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; if `n` is 4, `res` is 2; if `n` is not 4 and not even, `res` is 1**
