The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `res`. The initial value of `n` is an integer input by the user and is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive. Since no operations are performed on `n`, its value remains unchanged. The only new variable created is `res`, which is now `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive; `res` is 0**
