Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to count the number of divisors of `num`, but this approach does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the program needs to find the number of different weights of splits of `n`, not the number of divisors.

For example, consider the input `n = 8`. According to the problem description, the valid weights of splits of 8 are:
- Weight 1: [8]
- Weight 2: [4, 4]
- Weight 3: [3, 3, 2]
- Weight 4: [2, 2, 2, 2]
- Weight 8: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

However, the program will output `5`, which is the number of divisors of `8`, not the number of different weights of splits. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.
