Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not implement the logic required by the problem description. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of a given integer \( n \). However, the given code computes the number of divisors of \( n \) instead. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Problem Description vs. Code Logic**:
   - **Problem Description**: The task is to find the number of different weights of splits of \( n \). A weight of a split is defined as the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.
   - **Code Logic**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of divisors of \( n \).

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: For \( n = 7 \)
     - Correct Output: The weights of possible splits are \( 1, 2, 3, 7 \), so the output should be \( 4 \).
     - Incorrect Output: The program counts the divisors of 7, which are \( 1 \) and \( 7 \), so the output is \( 2 \).

   - **Example 2**: For \( n = 8 \)
     - Correct Output: The weights of possible splits are \( 1, 2, 4, 8 \), so the output should be \( 4 \).
     - Incorrect Output: The program counts the divisors of 8, which are \( 1, 2, 4, 8 \), so the output is \( 4 \). (This example seems correct but doesn't cover all cases.)

3. **General Case**:
   - The program needs to generate all possible nonincreasing sequences of positive integers that sum to \( n \) and count the distinct weights of these sequences.
   - Instead, it simply counts the divisors of \( n \), which does not address the required problem.

To correct the program, one approach could be to generate all possible splits and then compute their weights, but this is computationally intensive. A more efficient approach involves understanding the mathematical properties of the problem, which is beyond the current implementation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
