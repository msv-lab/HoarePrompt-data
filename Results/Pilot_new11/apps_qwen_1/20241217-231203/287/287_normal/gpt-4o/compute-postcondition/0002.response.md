Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\)
   - `count` is 0
   - `i` is 1

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `i * i <= num`

3. **Step Analysis**:
   - When `i` is 1, the loop condition becomes `1 * 1 <= num`, which simplifies to `1 <= num`.
   - Since `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), this condition is always true for any valid `num`.

4. **Determining if the Loop Can Execute**:
   - Given that `i` starts at 1 and the loop condition `i * i <= num` is true as long as `num` is within the specified range, the loop can indeed execute at least once.

5. **No Adjustment Needed**:
   - There is no need to adjust the states because the loop condition is already satisfied given the constraints on `num`.

Therefore, no state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
