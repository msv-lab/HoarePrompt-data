`count` is incremented by 1, so its new value is the previous value plus 1. The value of `num` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` must be at least 16; `count` is increased by 2 (since it was already increased by 1 in the initial state).

Output State: **`num` must be at least 16; `count` is increased by 2**
