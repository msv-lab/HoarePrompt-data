To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i * i <= num`. This means the loop stops when `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > num`.

2. **Inside the Loop**:
   - If `num % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `num`.
   - If `i != num // i`, it means `i` and `num // i` are distinct divisors of `num`, so we increment `count` by 1 more.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `num`: An integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).
   - `count`: Initially 0.
   - `i`: Initially 1.

### Iterations

- **First Iteration**:
  - `i = 1`
  - If `num % 1 == 0` (always true), `count += 1` â†’ `count = 1`.
  - Loop continues.

- **Second Iteration**:
  - `i = 2`
  - If `num % 2 == 0`, `count += 1` and if `i != num // i`, `count += 1`.
  - Loop continues.

- **General Iteration**:
  - For each `i`, check if `i` divides `num`.
  - If `i` is a divisor, increment `count`.
  - If `i` and `num // i` are distinct, increment `count` again.

### Final Iteration

The loop exits when `i * i > num`. At this point:
- `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > num`.
- All divisors of `num` up to `i-1` have been checked.

### Count Calculation

- Each time a divisor `i` is found, `count` increments.
- If `i` and `num // i` are distinct, `count` increments again.

### Conclusion

After the loop completes, `count` contains the number of divisors of `num` (including 1 and `num` itself if `num` is a perfect square).

- If `num` is a perfect square, `i` will be `sqrt(num) + 1` because `(sqrt(num))^2 < num` and `(sqrt(num) + 1)^2 > num`.
- If `num` is not a perfect square, `i` will be `ceil(sqrt(num))`.

### Output State

- `num` remains the same.
- `count` is the number of divisors of `num`.
- `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > num`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `count` is the number of divisors of `num`, and `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > num`.**
