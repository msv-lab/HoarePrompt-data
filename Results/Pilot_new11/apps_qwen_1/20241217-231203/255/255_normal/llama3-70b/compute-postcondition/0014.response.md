The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans`. It does not modify any variables, so the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The output of the print statement will be the value of `ans`, but since the value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state and no operations are performed on it, the value remains as it was before the print statement.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `s` is the same as the initial value, `ans` is the count of distinct consecutive pairs in the string `s` (ranging from 1 to `n-1`), the output is the value of `ans`**
