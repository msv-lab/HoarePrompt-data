Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The code counts the number of distinct consecutive pairs of characters in the string, which does not guarantee the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string.

For example, consider the string "aaaaa". According to the problem description, the minimum number of operations to delete this string is 1 (delete the entire substring "aaaaa"). However, the given code would incorrectly output 4 because it counts each pair of consecutive characters as a separate operation.

The correct approach would involve identifying and removing the longest contiguous substrings of identical characters in each step until the string is fully deleted. The provided code does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for many cases.
