Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clarifies that `operations` is incremented each time a different character is encountered compared to the previous character. This approach does not account for contiguous substrings of the same character, which must be deleted in a single operation according to the problem description. 

For instance, in the input "aaaaaa", the program would increment `operations` five times, resulting in an output of 5. However, the correct output should be 1, as the entire string can be deleted in a single operation. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
