Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string. It increments the `operations` counter whenever it encounters a different character than the previous one. This approach does not account for contiguous substrings of the same character.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aaaaaa
```

The program will output:
```
5
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1
```

This is because we can delete the entire string 'aaaaaa' in one operation by deleting the substring 'aaaaaa'. The current implementation only counts the number of distinct characters consecutively, which is not the correct approach for this problem.
