The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`, the value of `n` remains within this range after the input operation. However, without knowing the exact value of `n` provided by the input, we cannot specify a concrete value for `n`.

The string `s` is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters**.
