Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) from the user. It then counts the number of positions \( i \) (from 1 to \( n-1 \)) where the character at position \( i \) in the string is different from the character at position \( i-1 \). Finally, it prints the total count of such positions. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If \( n = 1 \), the loop will not execute because the range starts from 1. In this case, the count of differing characters will be 0.
- If the string \( s \) consists of only one unique character repeated throughout, the count of differing characters will also be 0.

Missing Functionality:
- The annotations mention that the program state includes the variable `n`, which is indeed read from the input. However, no initial check is provided to ensure that \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \). This could be an edge case that should be handled.
