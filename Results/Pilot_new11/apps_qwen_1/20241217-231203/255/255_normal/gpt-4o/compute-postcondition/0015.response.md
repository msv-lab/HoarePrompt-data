The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. The parameter constraints and relationships provided do not apply since no parameters are listed.

Given the output cases, it seems the function might be intended to process some internal data or perform an operation based on certain conditions, but without parameters, the function's purpose and input are unclear.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on internal conditions or data.**
