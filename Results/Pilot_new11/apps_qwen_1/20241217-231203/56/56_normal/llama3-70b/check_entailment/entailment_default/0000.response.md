Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the sum of the powers of 2 does not match the required \( n \) while still producing a sequence of length \( k \). Specifically, the code constructs a list `a` by repeatedly subtracting the highest power of 2 from \( n \) until \( n \) becomes 0. However, it does not ensure that the constructed list `a` can be truncated to form a sequence of length \( k \) that sums to \( n \). 

For example, consider the input:
```
23 5
```
The correct output should be:
```
Yes
3 3 2 1 0
```
However, the provided code would produce an incorrect output because it constructs the list `a` based on the bit lengths of the powers of 2 subtracted from \( n \) without checking if the resulting list can be truncated to the desired length \( k \).

Here is an example where the code fails:
```
Input:
23 5
Output:
No
```
This is incorrect because a valid sequence exists that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the code needs to check if the constructed list can be truncated to the required length and sum correctly.
