Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not handle cases where the sequence needs to include negative exponents, which are necessary to form the required sum. For example, the input `1 2` should result in `Yes -1 -1`, but the current implementation fails to account for this scenario. The output hints confirm that the program only considers non-negative exponents, leading to incorrect outputs in cases where negative exponents are required. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description and the original assessment correctly identifies this issue.
