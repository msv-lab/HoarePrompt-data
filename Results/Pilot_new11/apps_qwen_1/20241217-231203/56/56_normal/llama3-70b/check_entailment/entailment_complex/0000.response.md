Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The program first checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints 'No' immediately. This ensures that if `n` cannot be represented using `k` distinct powers of 2, the function returns 'No', adhering to the problem constraints.

2. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The program uses a while loop to repeatedly find the highest bit (`x`) of `n` (using `bit_length() - 1`) and appends `x` to the list `a`. It then subtracts `2^x` from `n`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. This step correctly constructs a sequence of bit lengths corresponding to the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`.

3. **Ensuring the Length of the Sequence:**
   - After constructing the list `a`, the program checks if its length is less than `k`. If so, it prints 'No' because the constructed sequence does not meet the required length. This handles the case where it is impossible to find `k` distinct powers of 2 that sum to `n`.

4. **Truncating and Sorting the Sequence:**
   - If the length of `a` is at least `k`, the program truncates `a` to its first `k` elements. Then, it sorts these elements in descending order. This ensures that the sequence is lexicographically largest among all possible sequences of length `k` that sum to `n`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints 'Yes' followed by the truncated and sorted sequence of integers. This correctly outputs the required result according to the problem statement.

In summary, the program accurately follows the problem description by performing the necessary checks, constructing the correct sequence, and ensuring the sequence is lexicographically largest. Therefore, the program is correct.
