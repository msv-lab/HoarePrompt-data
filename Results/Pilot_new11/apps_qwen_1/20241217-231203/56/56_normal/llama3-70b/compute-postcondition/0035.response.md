The code `print(' '.join(map(str, a)))` does not change the values of the variables `n`, `a`, or `i`. Instead, it prints the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. Since the initial state is that `n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `k` elements of its original list, and `i` is -1, these variables remain unchanged after the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `k` elements of its original list, `i` is -1**
