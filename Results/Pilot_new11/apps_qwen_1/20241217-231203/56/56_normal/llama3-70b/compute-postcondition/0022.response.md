The code `x = n.bit_length() - 1` calculates the bit length of `n` (which is the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary), subtracts 1 from it, and assigns the result to `x`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, its bit length is at least 1. Subtracting 1 from the bit length gives us a non-negative integer.

- The bit length of `n` is `bit_length`.
- Subtracting 1 from `bit_length` gives `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is `n.bit_length() - 1`**
