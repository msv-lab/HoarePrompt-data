The code `print('No')` does not affect any variables. It simply prints the string 'No' to the console. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the bit lengths of the powers of 2 subtracted from the original `n` during each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations (which is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n` minus 1), `x` is the last bit length appended to `a`. The length of `a` is less than `k`**
