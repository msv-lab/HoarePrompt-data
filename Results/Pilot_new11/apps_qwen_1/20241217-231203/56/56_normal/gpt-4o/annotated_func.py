#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). The function checks if the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

1. If `k` is greater than `n`, the function immediately returns 'No'.
2. Otherwise, it creates a list `bits` containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.
3. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, the function returns 'No'.
4. If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, the function repeatedly modifies the list by appending the previous value of the smallest index in `bits` minus 1, until the length of `bits` equals `k`.
5. Finally, the list `bits` is sorted in reverse order, and the function returns 'Yes' followed by a space-separated list of integers contained in the variable `bits`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than `n` by returning 'No'.
- The function correctly handles the case where the number of set bits in `n` is less than `k` by returning 'No'.
- The function ensures that the last element of `bits` is the result of repeatedly subtracting 2 from the original `smallest` until the length of `bits` reaches `k`, which is a unique aspect of the function.

After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, and the function returns either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a space-separated list of integers contained in the variable `bits`, where `bits` contains the indices of `k` set bits from `n` sorted in reverse order.
