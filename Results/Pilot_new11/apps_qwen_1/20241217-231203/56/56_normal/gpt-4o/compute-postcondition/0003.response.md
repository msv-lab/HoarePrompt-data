The code initializes an empty list named `bits`. This means that no new values are assigned to `n` or `k`, and their values remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the creation of the `bits` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and k ≤ n; `bits` is an empty list.**
