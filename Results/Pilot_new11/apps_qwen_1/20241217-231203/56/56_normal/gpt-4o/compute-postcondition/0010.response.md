Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the value of `i` which is the smallest integer such that \((n >> i) & 1 == 1\). If \( (n >> 59) & 1 == 1 \), `59` is included in `bits`. Otherwise, `59` is not included in `bits`.***
