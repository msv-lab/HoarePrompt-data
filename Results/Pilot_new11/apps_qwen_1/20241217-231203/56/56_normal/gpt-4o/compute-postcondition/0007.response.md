Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the value of `i` which is the smallest integer such that \((n >> i) & 1 == 1\).*** 

Explanation: 
- The if part specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the given range, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is an empty list. If the condition \( (n >> i) & 1 == 1 \) is true, then `i` (the smallest integer for which this condition holds) is added to the `bits` list.
- Since there is no else part provided, we only consider the if part's effect on the postcondition. Therefore, the `bits` list will contain the smallest `i` for which the condition is true.
