Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \)
- \( k \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^5 \) and \( k \leq n \)
- `bits` is a list containing the value of \( i \) which is the smallest integer such that \((n >> i) & 1 == 1\)

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(60, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from 60 down to -1 (inclusive). Therefore, at the start of each iteration, the loop variable `i` decreases by 1.

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `bits` remains the same.

3. **State at the Start of Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `i` will decrease by 1. Hence, if `i` was 60 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 59 at the start of the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `bits`) remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the values of `n`, `k`, and `bits` do not change. The only thing that changes is the loop variable `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \), `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^5 \) and \( k \leq n \), `bits` is a list containing the value of `i` which is the smallest integer such that \((n >> i) & 1 == 1\), `i` is 59**.
