The code `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the list `bits` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Given the initial state, the last element of `bits` is `smallest - 1`. After removing this element, `smallest` will now hold the value of `smallest - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `smallest` is the value of the last element of `bits` before popping, which is now equal to `smallest - 1`
- `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`, but it no longer includes the last element, so its length is now `len(bits) - 1`, which is still less than `k`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\); `smallest` is `smallest - 1`; `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element removed and its length is still less than `k`.**
