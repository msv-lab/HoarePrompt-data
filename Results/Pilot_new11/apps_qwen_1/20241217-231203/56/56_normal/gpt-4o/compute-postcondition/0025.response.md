The code appends `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. Given the initial state, `smallest` is `smallest - 1`. This means that the last element of `bits` is now `smallest - 1`, and since `smallest` was already `smallest - 1` before the operation, appending this value does not change the last element. The length of `bits` remains less than `k + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\); `smallest` is `smallest - 1`; `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element removed and now contains `smallest - 1` as its last element, and its length is less than `k` + 1.**
