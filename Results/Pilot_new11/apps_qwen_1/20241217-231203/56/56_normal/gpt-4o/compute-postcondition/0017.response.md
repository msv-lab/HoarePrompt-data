Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`. The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`**
