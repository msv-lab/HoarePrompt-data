The code `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the list `bits` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. According to the initial state, `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element removed, and its length is exactly `k - 1`. The last element of `bits` is `smallest - 1`. After executing `smallest = bits.pop()`, the last element of `bits` is removed, and `smallest` is assigned the value of this last element, which is `smallest - 1`.

So, the updated values are:
- `smallest` is now equal to `smallest - 1`
- The list `bits` no longer has the last element, which was `smallest - 1`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `smallest` is `smallest - 1 - 1` (or `smallest - 2`), `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element removed and now contains `smallest - 2` as its last element, and its length is exactly `k - 2`**
