Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of bits required to represent `n` is less than `k`. Specifically, if the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is less than `k`, the program incorrectly returns "No" without attempting to fill the remaining positions with `-1`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
Yes
-1 -1 0
```
However, the program will return "No" because it checks if the number of bits is greater than `k`, which is not the correct condition to check.

To fix this, the program should attempt to fill the remaining positions with `-1` if the number of bits is less than `k`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n.bit_length():
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    while len(bits) < k:
        bits.append(-1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))

print(func_1(n, k))
```

This version correctly handles the case where the number of bits required to represent `n` is less than `k` by filling the remaining positions with `-1`.
