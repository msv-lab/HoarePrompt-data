You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.


-----Examples-----
Input
100

Output
99

Input
48

Output
48

Input
521

Output
499
Program:
```
x = int(input().strip())
x_str = str(x)
n = len(x_str)
if x_str[0] != '1':
    candidate = int(x_str[0]) - 1
    candidate = str(candidate) + '9' * (n - 1)
else:
    candidate = '9' * (n - 1)
candidate = int(candidate)
sum_x = func_1(x)
sum_candidate = func_1(candidate)
if sum_candidate > sum_x:
    print(candidate)
else:
    print(x)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input number itself is already the largest number with the maximum sum of digits. For example, consider the input `48`. According to the problem description, the output should be `48` because it has the maximum sum of digits among numbers less than or equal to `48`, and it is also the largest such number. However, the current implementation does not check this condition properly. It always compares the candidate number with the original number and prints the candidate if its digit sum is greater, which is not correct in this scenario.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and returns the sum of its digits. The function converts the integer `n` to a string to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up. This process works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
