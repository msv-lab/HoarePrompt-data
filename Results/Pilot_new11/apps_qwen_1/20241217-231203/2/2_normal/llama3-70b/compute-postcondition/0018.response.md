Postcondition: ***`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is the maximum number between `i + 1` and `i + 2`, and `max_sum` is the greater digit sum between the digit sum of `i + 1` and the digit sum of `i + 2`; if `digit_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_num` becomes `i + 1` and `max_sum` becomes `digit_sum`. Otherwise, `max_num` remains `max_num` and `max_sum` remains `max_sum`.***
