The code `max_num = i` updates the value of `max_num` to be the current value of `i`. The initial state defines that `max_num` is equal to the maximum number between `i + 1` and `i + 2`. After executing the code, `max_num` will take the value of `i`, which might be less than, equal to, or greater than the maximum of `i + 1` and `i + 2`. However, since `max_num` was previously set to the maximum of `i + 1` and `i + 2`, it implies that the new value of `max_num` could be less than the original value, equal to it, or even greater if `i` itself is the maximum.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `max_num` is now `i`.
- The condition for `max_num` being the maximum of `i + 1` and `i + 2` is no longer directly applicable, as it has been overwritten.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1; `max_num` is `i`; `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`; `digit_sum` is the sum of digits of `i`.**
