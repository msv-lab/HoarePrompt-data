The code `digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))` calculates the digit sum of `i`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, only that `x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to the maximum number between `i + 1` and `i + 2`, and `max_sum` is equal to the greater digit sum between the digit sum of `i + 1` and the digit sum of `i + 2`.

Since the code does not affect `x` or `max_num` or `max_sum`, and only calculates `digit_sum` for `i`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to the maximum number between `i + 1` and `i + 2`, and `max_sum` is equal to the greater digit sum between the digit sum of `i + 1` and the digit sum of `i + 2`; `digit_sum` is calculated as the sum of digits of `i`.**
