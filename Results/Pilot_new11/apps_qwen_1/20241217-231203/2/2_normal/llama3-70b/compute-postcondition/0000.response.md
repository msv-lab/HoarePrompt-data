The code reads an input string representing a positive integer `x` and converts it to an integer using `int()`. The input is guaranteed to be a string representing a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. After executing the code, the variable `x` holds the integer value of the input string.

Output State: **the input string is converted to an integer, so `x` is the integer value of the input string and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18**
