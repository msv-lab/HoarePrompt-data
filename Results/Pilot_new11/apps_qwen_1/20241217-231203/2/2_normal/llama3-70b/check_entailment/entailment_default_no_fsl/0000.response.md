Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the positive integer that doesn't exceed \( x \) and has the maximum sum of digits. It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( x \), calculates the sum of the digits of each integer, and keeps track of the integer with the highest digit sum. If there are multiple integers with the same highest digit sum, it selects the largest one. This approach ensures that the code meets the requirements for every potential case within the given constraints \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^{18} \). Therefore, the code is correct according to the problem description.
