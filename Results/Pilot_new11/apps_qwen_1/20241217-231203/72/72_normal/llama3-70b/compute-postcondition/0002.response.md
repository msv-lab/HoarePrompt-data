First, let's understand the given initial state and the operation being performed:

- Initial State: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers with specific ranges.
- `max_asked` is defined as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`.

Now, let's execute the code:

```python
min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
```

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Calculate `max_asked`: `max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`.
2. Update `min_asked` using the formula `min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`.

Let's express `min_asked` in terms of `k` and `n`:

- Substitute `max_asked` into the formula: `min_asked = max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))`.

To simplify this expression further, note that:

- `max(1, a)` returns `a` if `a ≥ 1` and `1` otherwise.
- We need to evaluate `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1)` and ensure it meets the condition to determine the final value of `min_asked`.

Since `k`, `n`, and the other variables remain unchanged except for `min_asked`, we update `min_asked` as follows:

- `min_asked = max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n), `min_asked` is `max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))`.**
