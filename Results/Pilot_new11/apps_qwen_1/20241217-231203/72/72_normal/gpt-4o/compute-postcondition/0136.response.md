Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is equal to its initial value minus 1, the current value of `row` is either `-1` or `1`, `direction` is `1` if `row` is `1`, and the current value of `col` is `y` since the condition `direction != 1` still holds true.***
