Postcondition: ***`row` and `col` are integers. If `direction == 1` and `row == x`, then `row` is set to `x - 3` and `col` remains `y`. If `row == n`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `direction` is set to `-1`. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. If the condition `row == x` is not met, `row` is increased by `direction`, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged unless `row == x` and `col == y`, in which case it is set to `initial_value + 1`. `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` becomes `-1`, then `row` is adjusted to `direction + row + 2`. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` retain their states from the previous execution.***
