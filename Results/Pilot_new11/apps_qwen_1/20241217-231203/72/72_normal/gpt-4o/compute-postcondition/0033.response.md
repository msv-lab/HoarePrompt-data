`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 0, and the current value of `row` is equal to `x`. `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. After the code executes, the only change is in the value of `max_questions`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 0, and the current value of `row` is equal to `x`, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`.**
