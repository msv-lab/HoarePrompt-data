Postcondition: ***`row` is unchanged, `direction` remains unchanged, `col` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is unchanged + 1, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `initial_value` is unchanged. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` becomes `row - 2` and `direction` becomes -1. Otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if statement.***
