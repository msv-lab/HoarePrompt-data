Postcondition: ***`col` is 1, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1, and `row` is either `-3` or `-1` (as `row` cannot be `-1` or `1` if the condition `row == n` is false, it implies `row` must be `-3`), `direction` is `-1`.***
