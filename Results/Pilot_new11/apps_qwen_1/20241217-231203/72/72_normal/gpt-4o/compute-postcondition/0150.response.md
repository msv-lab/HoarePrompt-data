Postcondition: ***`col` is 1; `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0; `m` must still be greater than 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; `max_questions` is its initial value minus 1; `row` is 2; `direction` is 1. Since the if condition `row == -1` is false, all the variables retain their values as described in the else part (which in this case is none, meaning the values do not change).***
