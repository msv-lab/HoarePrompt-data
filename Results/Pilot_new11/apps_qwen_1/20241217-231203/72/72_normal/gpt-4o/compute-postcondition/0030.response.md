The code `row -= 2` subtracts 2 from the current value of `row`. Given the initial state, `row` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the new value of `row` will be `n - 2`.

- `remaining_questions` and `m` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code.
- `col` remains 0 because the code does not modify it.
- `sergei_questions` remains unchanged because the condition for incrementing it (`row == x` and `col == y`) is not met with the new value of `row`.
- `max_questions` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
- `direction` remains -1 because the code does not modify it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `row` is equal to `n - 2`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`, otherwise remains unchanged, `max_questions` is `max_questions + 1`, `direction` is -1.**
