Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `direction` is equal to -1, and `row` is equal to `n - 1`.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and there is no alternative action specified, the overall postcondition is derived from the if part alone. According to the if part, if `row == n`, then `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `direction` is equal to -1, and `row` is equal to `n - 1`.
