`row` is incremented by the value of `direction`. The value of `direction` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as an unspecified variable. The other variables (`remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, and `max_questions`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is increased by `direction`**
