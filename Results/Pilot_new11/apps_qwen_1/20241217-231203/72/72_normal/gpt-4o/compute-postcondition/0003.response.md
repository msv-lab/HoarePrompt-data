The code calculates `full_cycle_length` based on the value of `n`. Since `n > 1`, the formula `(2 * n - 2) * m` is used. The value of `x` is updated to `x - 1`, and `y` is decreased by 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged.

- The value of `x` is now `x - 1`.
- The value of `y` is now `y - 1`.
- `full_cycle_length` is calculated as `(2 * n - 2) * m`.

Output State: **`1 ≤ x - 1 ≤ n`; `n`, `m`, `k`, `y` are as per their initial conditions, `y` is decreased by 1; `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`.**
