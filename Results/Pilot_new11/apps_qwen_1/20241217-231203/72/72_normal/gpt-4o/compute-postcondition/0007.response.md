The code `max_questions = full_cycles` assigns the value of `full_cycles` to the variable `max_questions`. This does not change the values of other variables. 

Here's the breakdown:
- `max_questions` is now equal to `full_cycles`.
- `full_cycles` remains as \(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\).
- `full_cycle_length` remains as \((2 * n - 2) * m\).
- `full_cycles` remains as \(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\).
- `remaining_questions` remains as \(K \% ((2 * n - 2) * m)\).
- `min_questions` remains as \(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\).

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`1 \leq x - 1 \leq n`, `n` is as per its initial condition, `m` is as per its initial condition, `k` is as per its initial condition, `y` is decreased by 1, `full_cycle_length` is \((2 * n - 2) * m\), `full_cycles` is \(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\), `remaining_questions` is \(K \% ((2 * n - 2) * m)\), `min_questions` is \(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\), `max_questions` is \(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\)**
