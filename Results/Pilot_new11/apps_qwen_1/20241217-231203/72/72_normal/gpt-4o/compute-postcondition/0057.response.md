`max_questions` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is the original value plus 1. The values of `remaining_questions`, `m`, `row`, `col`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 2, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`; otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is the original value plus 1.**
