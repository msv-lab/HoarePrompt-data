Postcondition: ***`col` will be 1, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, and `m` must still be greater than 0. `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1. Depending on the value of `direction`: if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1 and `row` is -2. Otherwise, `max_questions` is its initial value minus 1, and `row` is either `-1` or `1`.***
