`row` is initially either -1 or 1. After executing `row -= 2`, the value of `row` will be adjusted by subtracting 2 from its current value. Therefore, if `row` was -1, it becomes -3, and if `row` was 1, it becomes -1. 

The states of the other variables (`col`, `remaining_questions`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, and `direction`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col` is 2, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value plus 2, `row` is either -3 or -1, `direction` is -1**
