The code subtracts 2 from `row`. Given the initial state, the value of `row` is increased by `direction`, which is -1, so the original value of `row` was `direction + 1`, i.e., `0`. After executing `row -= 2`, the new value of `row` is `0 - 2 = -2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `col` is 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is -2, `direction` is -1**
