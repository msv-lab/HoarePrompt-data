The code `min_questions = full_cycles` assigns the value of `full_cycles` to `min_questions`. This does not affect any other variables. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`1 \leq x - 1 \leq n`, `n` is as per its initial condition, `m` is as per its initial condition, `k` is as per its initial condition, `y` is decreased by 1, `full_cycle_length` is \((2 * n - 2) * m\), `full_cycles` is \(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\), `remaining_questions` is \( K \% ((2 * n - 2) * m)\), `min_questions` is \(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\)**
