`sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, which means it is now equal to its previous value plus 1. The other variables (`remaining_questions`, `m`, `row`, and `column`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `row` is equal to `x`, `column` is equal to `y`, and `sergei_questions` is equal to its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `row` is equal to `x`, `column` is equal to `y`, `sergei_questions` is equal to its previous value plus 1**
