The code `row += 2` increments the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state where `row` is either -2 or 2, let's consider both cases:

1. If `row` is -2, then `row += 2` results in `row` being -2 + 2 = 0.
2. If `row` is 2, then `row += 2` results in `row` being 2 + 2 = 4.

All other variables (`col`, `remaining_questions`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, `direction`) remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Therefore, the updated states are as follows:

- `row` is either 0 or 4 (depending on the initial value)
- All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`col` is 2; `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0; `m` must still be greater than 0; `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1; `max_questions` is its initial value; `row` is either 0 or 4; `direction` is 1**
