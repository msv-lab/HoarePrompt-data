Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code has several issues that make it incorrect for every potential case:

1. **Handling of `full_cycle_length` when \( n = 1 \)**: The code calculates `full_cycle_length` as \((2 * n - 2) * m\) even when \( n = 1 \). This is incorrect because when \( n = 1 \), the teacher asks pupils in a single row without reversing the direction. The correct calculation should be `m`.

2. **Incomplete logic for `sergei_questions` in the else block**: The code snippet inside the else block for calculating `sergei_questions` is missing a closing parenthesis, leading to potential incorrect results. Specifically, the ternary operation for `sergei_questions` should be properly closed.

3. **Direction Handling in the remaining questions loop**: The direction handling in the loop where `remaining_questions` are processed is flawed. The logic to change the direction when the end of a row is reached is incorrect. The direction should be toggled correctly based on the current position.

Here is a corrected version of the code with explanations for the issues:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    
    # Corrected full_cycle_length calculation
    if n == 1:
        full_cycle_length = m
    else:
        full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m
    
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    
    if n > 1:
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    
    # Corrected sergei_questions calculation
    if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)
    else:
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)
    
    row = 0
    direction = 1
    for _ in range(remaining_questions):
        for col in range(m):
            if row == x and col == y:
                sergei_questions += 1
            if direction == 1:
                max_questions += 1
                row += direction
                if row == n:
                    direction = -1
                    row -= 2
            else:
                max_questions -= 1
                row += direction
                if row == -1:
                    direction = 1
                    row += 2
    
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)

func()
```

By addressing these issues, the code should now correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description.
