Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of cells `n` and the sequence of integers `a` from the input.
   
2. **Matrix Dimension Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `x` and `y` up to \(10^9\). This is done to check if there exist any dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) such that the maximum value in the sequence `a` fits within the matrix (i.e., \(x \cdot y \geq \max(a)\)).
   - This ensures that the sequence `a` can be validly placed within a matrix of size \(x \times y\).

3. **Path Validation**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks whether the given sequence `a` forms a valid path within the matrix of dimensions \(x \times y\).
   - It calculates the coordinates `(nx, ny)` for each integer `v` in `a` using the formula \(v = y \cdot (i-1) + j\), which is derived from the matrix definition provided in the problem statement.
   - It then verifies that each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell, which is checked by ensuring the Manhattan distance between consecutive coordinates is exactly 1.

4. **Output**:
   - If valid dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) are found, the program prints "YES" followed by the dimensions.
   - If no valid dimensions are found, the program prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the input sequence `a` might be empty, though the problem description implicitly assumes `a` is non-empty. The function `func_1` implicitly handles this by returning `False` for any invalid path, which aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The program also correctly checks that each integer in `a` is within the range \([1, x \cdot y]\).

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
