Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the code does not handle the case where the input list `a` is empty. Additionally, the code does not check if the values in `a` are within the range `[1, xy]` before attempting to validate the path, which could lead to incorrect results if invalid inputs are provided.

To ensure the code works correctly, it should:
1. Return `False` if the input list `a` is empty.
2. Check if all values in `a` are within the range `[1, xy]`.
3. Validate the path using the `func_1` function.

Since the code does not cover these critical cases, it cannot be considered correct for every potential case.
