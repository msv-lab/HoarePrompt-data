`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` will take an input from the user and `int()` will convert it into an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. After running the code, the value of `n` will be the integer input provided by the user, which must fall within the specified range. The precondition that `n` is an integer within the range `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9` still holds true.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
