`n` is an integer ending in 9, and `max_9s` is 1. The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, which removes the last digit from `n`. Since `n` ends in 9, after the operation, `n` will be an integer that does not end in 9 (because we removed the last digit, which was 9). The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that does not end in 9, `max_9s` is 1**
