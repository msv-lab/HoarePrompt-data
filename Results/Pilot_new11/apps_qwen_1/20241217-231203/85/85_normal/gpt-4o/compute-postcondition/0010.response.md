`n` is divided by 10 using integer division (`//=`), which removes the last digit from `n`. Since `n` must end in 9, after dividing by 10, the new value of `n` will no longer end in 9, but the condition that `n` must be a number that was originally ending in 9 remains implied. The value of `max_9s` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `n` divided by 10 (no longer ending in 9), `max_9s` is 3**
