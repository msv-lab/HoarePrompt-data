Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to consider pairs where the sum of the shovels' costs ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The program only checks if the sum modulo \(10^{(\text{length of sum} - 1)}\) is zero, which is not sufficient to find the maximum possible number of trailing nines.

For example, consider the input `50`. According to the problem description, the optimal pair is (49, 50), which gives a sum of 99, ending with two nines. However, the program would not identify this pair correctly because it does not account for sums that produce the maximum number of trailing nines.

To fix this, the program needs to find pairs \((i, n - i)\) such that the sum \(i + (n - i)\) ends with the maximum number of nines. This can be done by checking for the highest power of 10 that divides the sum minus the appropriate multiple of 10.
