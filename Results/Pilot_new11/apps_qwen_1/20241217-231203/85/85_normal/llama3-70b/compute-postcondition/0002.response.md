State: **`n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (due to `range(1, n // 2 + 1)`).
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n // 2 + 1`.
3. Since `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, we confirm this constraint.
4. The initial value of `ans` is given as 0.
5. No other state needs adjustment since `i` is explicitly set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Thus, the required state before the loop execution is that `n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 1.
