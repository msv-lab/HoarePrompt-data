Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the given ratio (1:2:4). The `min_lemon` variable is set to the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, ensuring that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available quantities of apples and pears. The final output is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which represents the total number of fruits used in the compote.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly, as demonstrated by the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
