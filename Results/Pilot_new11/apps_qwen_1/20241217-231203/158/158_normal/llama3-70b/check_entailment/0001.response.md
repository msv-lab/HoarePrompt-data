Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote by finding the minimum number of lemons that can be used (which is the limiting factor), and then calculating the corresponding number of apples and pears. The program handles all potential cases correctly based on the given constraints and examples:

- For the first example (`2` lemons, `5` apples, `7` pears), the output is `7`, which is correct because Nikolay can use `1` lemon, `2` apples, and `4` pears.
- For the second example (`4` lemons, `7` apples, `13` pears), the output is `21`, which is correct because Nikolay can use `3` lemons, `6` apples, and `12` pears.
- For the third example (`2` lemons, `3` apples, `2` pears), the output is `0`, which is correct because there are not enough pears to use any lemons.

Since the program works correctly for all provided examples and follows the problem description accurately, the correctness is True.
