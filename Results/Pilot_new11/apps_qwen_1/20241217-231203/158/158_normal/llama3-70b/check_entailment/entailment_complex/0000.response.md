Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, which represents the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. This aligns with the problem's input specification.

2. **Calculating the Minimum Value**:
   - The line `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) that can be used without breaking any fruits. 
   - `b // 2` ensures that the number of apples is at least twice the number of lemons.
   - `c // 4` ensures that the number of pears is at least four times the number of lemons.
   - Taking the minimum of these values gives the maximum number of complete sets that can be used.

3. **Calculating and Printing the Result**:
   - The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` calculates the total number of fruits that can be used.
   - Specifically, `min_lemon` corresponds to the lemons, `min_lemon * 2` corresponds to the apples, and `min_lemon * 4` corresponds to the pears.
   - The program prints this total, which matches the problem's output requirement.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no suitable fruits (i.e., the minimum value is 0), the program will print 0, which is correct according to the problem description.
   - The program handles all valid inputs within the specified range (1 to 1000) appropriately.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, and it produces the expected output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
