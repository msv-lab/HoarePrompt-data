The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list `def func():`. The parameter constraints provided (a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000) are not applicable since no parameters are specified in the function definition.

Given the output cases, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or missing context since the function itself does not take any arguments to perform the described operations. Based on the provided information:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on some conditions involving a, b, and c, which are not passed to the function.**
