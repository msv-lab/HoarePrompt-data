Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the user, as required. Each of these integers represents the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, and the constraints \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1000\) are adhered to.

2. **Calculating Maximum Number of Lemons**: The variable `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available quantities of lemons, apples, and pears in the required ratio (1:2:4).

3. **Calculating Total Fruits**: The total number of fruits is computed using the formula `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `total_fruits = 7 * max_lemons`. This calculation ensures that the number of lemons, apples, and pears used is in the correct ratio.

4. **Printing Result**: The result, which is the total number of fruits used, is printed. If no fruits can be used (i.e., `max_lemons` is 0), the output is 0, as required.

The program handles all cases correctly as per the problem description. It determines the maximum number of fruits that can be used while maintaining the required ratio and prints the result accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
