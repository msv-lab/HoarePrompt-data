Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio. For each lemon used, it uses 2 apples and 4 pears. The program determines the limiting factor among lemons, apples, and pears by finding the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available number of apples and pears required for the ratio. The total number of fruits used is then calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which correctly reflects the sum of lemons, apples, and pears used. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles all potential cases correctly.
