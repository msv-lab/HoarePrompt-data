The code calculates `total_fruits` as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. Given that `max_lemons` is 3, we can substitute this value into the equation:

`total_fruits = 3 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4`

This simplifies to:

`total_fruits = 3 + 6 + 12`

Which further simplifies to:

`total_fruits = 21`

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is 10, `b` is 8, `c` is 12, `max_lemons` is 3, `total_fruits` is 21**
