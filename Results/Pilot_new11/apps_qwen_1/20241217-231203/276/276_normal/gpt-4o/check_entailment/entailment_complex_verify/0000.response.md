Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program does not correctly implement the golden system comparison as required. Specifically:

1. The function `func_1` computes the decimal value of a single golden system number but does not perform any comparison between two numbers.
2. The main part of the program computes the decimal values of both inputs separately and compares them, which is incorrect because it should directly compare the two numbers in the golden system.

The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` only computes the decimal value of a single golden number, and the main logic of the program incorrectly computes and compares these decimal values instead of comparing the golden system numbers directly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
