Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion of a golden system number to its decimal value using the formula given in the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates over each digit of the input string, reverses it to process from the least significant digit, and calculates the decimal value by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of \( q \). 

The main part of the program compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=') based on the comparison. Since the program follows the exact steps required to convert and compare the numbers in the golden system, and there are no logical errors or edge cases that are not handled, the program is correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.
