Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated code and the problem description. The program correctly converts a golden system number to its decimal value using the given formula. The function `func_1` iterates over the reversed string, correctly calculating the positional factor for each digit and summing the results. The main part of the program then compares these decimal values and outputs the correct symbol ('>', '<', or '=') based on their comparison. There are no logical errors or edge cases that are not handled, and the annotations confirm the correct behavior of the program at each step. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
