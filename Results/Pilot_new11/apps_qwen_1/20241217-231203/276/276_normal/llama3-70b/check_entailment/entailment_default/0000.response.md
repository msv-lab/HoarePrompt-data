Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the comparison of two numbers in the "golden system." The program reads two strings representing numbers in the golden system, converts them to their decimal values using the `func_1` function, and then compares these decimal values to determine which number is larger. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system by iterating over the reversed string and multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \).

The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` performs the necessary calculations correctly, and the main part of the program correctly compares the decimal values obtained from `func_1`. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the problem description that suggest the program does not work correctly. Therefore, the program satisfies the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
