Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that converts a number represented in the golden system to its decimal value using the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The main part of the program compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ("<", "=", ">").

The code handles all potential cases as follows:
- It correctly processes non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1'.
- It calculates the decimal value accurately by iterating over the string in reverse order and applying the positional factors.
- It compares the decimal values and outputs the correct symbol based on their comparison.

Since the code follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all necessary operations correctly, the program is correct.
