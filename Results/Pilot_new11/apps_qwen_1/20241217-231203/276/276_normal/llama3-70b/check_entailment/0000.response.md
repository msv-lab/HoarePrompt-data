Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for converting a number from the "golden system" to its decimal value using the given formula. The comparison logic between the two numbers in their decimal form is also implemented correctly. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle, making it correct according to the provided criteria.
