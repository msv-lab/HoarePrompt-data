Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to compare two numbers represented in the "golden system." Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires comparing two numbers in the golden system, which is based on the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \). The decimal value of a number in the golden system is computed as \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i} \).

2. **Function Implementation**: 
   - The `func_1` function converts a string representation of a number in the golden system into its decimal value.
   - It uses the golden ratio \( q \) and iterates through the string in reverse order to compute the weighted sum of each digit.
   - The function handles the conversion correctly by multiplying each digit by \( q \) raised to the power of its position index (which is calculated as the length of the string minus the current index).

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main part of the program reads two strings from the input.
   - It calls `func_1` to convert each string to its decimal value.
   - It compares the two decimal values and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=') based on their comparison.

Since the function `func_1` accurately computes the decimal value of a number in the golden system, and the main program correctly compares these values, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
