You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion of a golden system number to its decimal value using the formula given in the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates over each digit of the input string, reverses it to process from the least significant digit, and calculates the decimal value by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of \( q \). 

The main part of the program compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=') based on the comparison. Since the program follows the exact steps required to convert and compare the numbers in the golden system, and there are no logical errors or edge cases that are not handled, the program is correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `c` is the character at the corresponding position in the original string `s`, `i` is the length of `s` minus the current iteration count, `decimal` is the sum of `int(c) * q
    return decimal
    #The program returns the sum of the integer value of each character 'c' in the string 's' multiplied by its positional factor 'q', where 'q' is calculated as the length of 's' minus the current iteration count


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
