Step 1: Understand the initial state.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `c` is the third-to-last character of `s`.
- `i` is the length of `s` minus three.
- `decimal` is `2 * int(c) * q`.

Step 2: Analyze the code snippet.
- The code updates `decimal` by adding `int(c) * q ** i` to its current value.

Step 3: Calculate the updated value of `decimal`.
- Initially, `decimal = 2 * int(c) * q`.
- After executing `decimal += int(c) * q ** i`, the new value of `decimal` becomes `2 * int(c) * q + int(c) * q ** i`.

Step 4: Formulate the output state.
- The length of `s` remains unchanged, so `i` remains the same.
- The third-to-last character of `s` remains `c`.
- The value of `q` remains unchanged.
- The new value of `decimal` is `2 * int(c) * q + int(c) * q ** i`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the third-to-last character of `s`, `i` is the length of `s` minus three, `decimal` is `2 * int(c) * q + int(c) * q ** i`.**
