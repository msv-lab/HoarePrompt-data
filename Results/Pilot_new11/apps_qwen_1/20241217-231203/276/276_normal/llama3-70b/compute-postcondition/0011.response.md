Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of each character's value (considering '0' as 0 and '1' as 1) multiplied by its positional factor, which is the length of the string minus the current iteration count. The positional factor is determined using the golden ratio `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2` and applied to each character in reverse order. The function iterates over the reversed string, calculating the weighted sum of each character.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes `s` is a non-empty string consisting of only '0' and '1' characters. If `s` contains any other characters, the function will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert the character to an integer.
- The function correctly handles the golden ratio calculation and application to each character's position but does not explicitly handle cases where the string length is zero. However, since the problem statement mentions that `s` is a non-empty string, this case is not applicable.

After the function concludes, the program will have a single numeric value returned, which represents the sum of the integer values of each character in the string `s` multiplied by their respective positional factors derived from the golden ratio.
