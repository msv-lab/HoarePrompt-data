Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `c` is the last character of `s`.
   - `i` is the length of `s` minus one.
   - `decimal` is `0 + int(c) * q`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the reversed string `s`.
   - `enumerate(reversed(s))` returns pairs `(i, c)` where `i` is the index and `c` is the character from the reversed string.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration:
     - `s` is a non-empty string.
     - `c` is the last character of the original string `s`.
     - `i` is the length of the original string `s` minus one.
     - `decimal` is calculated as `0 + int(c) * q`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that it corresponds to the next character in the reversed string.
   - The next character in the reversed string would be the second-to-last character of the original string `s`.
   - Therefore, `c` will now be the second-to-last character of the original string `s`.
   - The index `i` will decrease by 1 because the loop advances to the next character in the reversed string.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `s` remains a non-empty string.
   - `c` is now the second-to-last character of the original string `s`.
   - `i` is now the length of the original string `s` minus two.
   - `decimal` will be updated based on the new value of `c`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second-to-last character of `s`, `i` is the length of `s` minus two, `decimal` is `0 + int(c) * q**
