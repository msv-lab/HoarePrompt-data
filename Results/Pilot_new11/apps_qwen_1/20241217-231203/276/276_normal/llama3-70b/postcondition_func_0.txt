The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters and returns the sum of each character's value (considering '0' as 0 and '1' as 1) multiplied by its positional factor, which is the length of the string minus the current iteration count. The positional factor is determined using the golden ratio `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2` and applied to each character in reverse order. The function iterates over the reversed string, calculating the weighted sum of each character.
