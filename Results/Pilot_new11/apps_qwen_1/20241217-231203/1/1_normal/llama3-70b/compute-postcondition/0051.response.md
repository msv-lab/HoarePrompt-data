The line `f = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `f`. The initial values of `n`, `bind`, and `ind` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is `True`, `bind` is `-1`, `ind` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `f` is `True`, `bind` is `-1`, `ind` remains unchanged**
