`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ind` remains an integer such that `ind <= bind`, and `s` remains a string. The value of `i` is `ind + 3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ind` is an integer such that `ind <= bind`, `s` is a string, `i` is `ind + 3`, and `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ind` is an integer such that `ind <= bind`, `s` is a string, `i` is `ind + 3`, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
