Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `f` is True, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is -1, `bind` is equal to `i`, `s[i]` is equal to `':'`, `s[i]` is not equal to `']'`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
