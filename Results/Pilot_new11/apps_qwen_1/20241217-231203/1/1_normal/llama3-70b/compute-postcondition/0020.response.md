Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s[i+1]` is checked, `f` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, and `ind` is set accordingly based on the previous iteration's outcome. If `f` is true, `ind` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or conditional statement is broken out of. If `f` is false, `ind` remains unchanged.***
