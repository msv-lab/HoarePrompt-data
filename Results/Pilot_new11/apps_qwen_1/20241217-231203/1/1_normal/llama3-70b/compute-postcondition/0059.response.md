The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `f`, `ind`, and `bind` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the input string `s`, `f` is `True`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is `-1`. If `s[i]` is `']'` for any `i`, then `bind` is `-1`; otherwise, `bind` is the last index `i` where `s[i]` is `':'` and `f` is `True`. The condition `(ind == -1 or bind == -1)` is satisfied.**
