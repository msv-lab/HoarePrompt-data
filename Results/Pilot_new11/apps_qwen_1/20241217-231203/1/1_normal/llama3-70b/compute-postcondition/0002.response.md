The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ind`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains with `s` being the input string from the user and `n` being the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string from the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is -1**
