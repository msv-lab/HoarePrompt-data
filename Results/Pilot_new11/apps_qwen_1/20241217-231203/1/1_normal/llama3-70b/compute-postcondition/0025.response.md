The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block structure. In this case, it does not affect the values of any variables but simply exits the loop or block. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s[i+1]` will be checked, `f` retains its value from the previous iteration, `ind` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or block structure.**
