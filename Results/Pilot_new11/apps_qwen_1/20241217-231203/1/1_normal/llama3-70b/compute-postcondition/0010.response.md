`ind` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition `(f)` is still true. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '[', and the current value of `s[i]` is ':'; `ind` is equal to `i`; the condition `(f)` is true.**
