Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s[i+1]` will be checked, and `f` retains its value from the previous iteration. If `s[i]` is '[', `f` becomes True and `ind` is set accordingly based on the next iteration's outcome. Otherwise, if `f` is True, `ind` is equal to `i` and the most internal loop or block structure is broken. If `f` is false, `ind` remains set accordingly based on the next iteration's outcome.***
