According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is the input string
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0
- `ind` is either the index of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found.

Since the loop is iterating over the length of the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same as it is the length of the string `s`.
- `ind` remains unchanged unless the loop body changes its value.

Given that the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`, and since `n` is the length of the string `s` (which is greater than 0), `i` will be incremented from its previous value to check the next character in the string.

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is either the index of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found, `i` is incremented by 1**
