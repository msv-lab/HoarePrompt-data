Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, the range `[bind - (bind - ind), ind]` must contain valid indices, `end_colon` is the index of the last `:` encountered within the range `[ind + 1, bind]` or `-1` if no `:` is found, `start_colon` is not equal to `-1`, `end_colon` is not equal to `-1`, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `start_colon + 1 <= end_colon`, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `pipe_count` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is `|`, and `i` is `start_colon + 2` after the execution of the if statement.***
