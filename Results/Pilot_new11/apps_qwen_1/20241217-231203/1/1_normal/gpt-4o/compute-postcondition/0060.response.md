Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`.
   - `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`.
   - The range `[bind - 2, ind]` must contain valid indices.
   - `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i` regardless of whether `s[i]` equals `':'` or not.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `bind - 1` and goes down to `ind` (inclusive).
   - The step size is `-1`, meaning the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1 from the value it had at the start of the current iteration.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `i` at the start of the current iteration as `i_start`.
   - After one iteration, `i` becomes `i_start - 1`.

5. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range `[bind - 1, ind]`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` should be `i_start - 2`.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `bind` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since the problem states no modifications are made inside the loop body, these variables stay the same.
   - `end_colon` will be updated to the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.

7. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ind` remains the same.
   - `bind` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `i_start - 2`.
   - `end_colon` is updated to `i_start - 2`.

Given that `i_start` is the value of `i` at the start of the current iteration, and we know `i` decreases by 1 each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this decrease.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, and the range `[bind - 2, ind]` must contain valid indices; `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i` - 2 regardless of whether `s[i-2]` equals `':'` or not.**
