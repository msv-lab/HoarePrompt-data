The variable `bind` is assigned the value of `i`. Initially, `i` is 0. Therefore, `bind` becomes 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is 0, `i` is 0**
