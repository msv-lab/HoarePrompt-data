Postcondition: ***`s` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `ind` remains the same, `bind` remains the same, the range `[bind - (bind - ind), ind]` remains valid, `end_colon` remains the same, `start_colon` remains the same, `i` is now `start_colon + 3`, `end_colon` remains the same, `start_colon` remains the same, `pipe_count` is increased by 1, and `s[i]` is either a pipe character (`|`) or not. If `s[i]` is a pipe character, `pipe_count` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not a pipe character, no changes occur regarding `pipe_count` and the other variables remain as described.***
