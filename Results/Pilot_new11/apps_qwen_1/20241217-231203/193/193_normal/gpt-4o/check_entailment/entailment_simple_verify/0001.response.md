Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program attempts to solve the problem using the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which is fundamentally flawed. This formula does not correctly account for the constraints of forming a valid equilateral triangle after each operation. The triangle inequality must be satisfied at every step, and simply reducing the side length by half or in any fixed manner without considering the constraints can lead to invalid triangles. 

For instance, in the annotated version, the initial values of `x` and `y` are integers within the specified range, but the logic to calculate the minimum number of steps is incorrect. The provided examples in the problem statement demonstrate that the given formula does not consistently produce the correct result across different inputs, indicating that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
