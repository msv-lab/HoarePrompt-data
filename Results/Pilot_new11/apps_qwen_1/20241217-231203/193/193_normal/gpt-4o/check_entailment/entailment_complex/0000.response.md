Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, Memory needs to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \(x\) into an equilateral triangle of side length \(y\) by modifying one side per second, ensuring that at all times the modified shape remains a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., the triangle inequality must hold). 

However, the program simply calculates and prints \(\left\lceil \frac{x - y}{2} \right\rceil\), which is the minimum number of seconds needed to reduce \(x\) to \(y\) by decrementing both sides equally until reaching \(y\). This approach does not guarantee that the intermediate states remain valid equilateral triangles because it assumes equal decrements for both sides, which may violate the triangle inequality for certain values of \(x\) and \(y\).

For instance, consider the input \(x = 8\) and \(y = 5\):
- The program would output \(3\) (since \(\left\lceil \frac{8 - 5}{2} \right\rceil = 2\)), but the steps would be: \( (8, 8, 8) \rightarrow (6, 8, 8) \rightarrow (5, 5, 8) \rightarrow (5, 5, 5)\).
- However, the step from \((8, 8, 8)\) to \((6, 8, 8)\) is invalid because the triangle inequality is not satisfied for \((6, 8, 8)\).

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure the triangle remains valid throughout the transformation process. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
