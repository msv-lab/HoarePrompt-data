Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y` by changing the length of one side at a time while maintaining the triangle inequality.

For example, consider the input `6 3`. The correct sequence of transformations would be:
- Start with (6, 6, 6)
- Change one side to 3: (6, 6, 3)
- Change another side to 4: (6, 4, 3)
- Change the last side to 3: (3, 4, 3)
- Finally, change the other two sides to 3: (3, 3, 3)

This requires 4 changes, but the program incorrectly outputs `3`.

Another example is `8 5`. The correct sequence would be:
- Start with (8, 8, 8)
- Change one side to 5: (8, 8, 5)
- Change another side to 6: (8, 5, 5)
- Finally, change the last side to 5: (5, 5, 5)

This requires 3 changes, but the program incorrectly outputs `3`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and should return `False`.
