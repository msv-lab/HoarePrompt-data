Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not solve the problem correctly. The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds needed to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y` by changing one side per second while maintaining the triangle inequality. Simply taking the absolute difference does not account for the constraints of forming a valid triangle during each step. For example, in the first sample input `(6, 3)`, the correct sequence would be:

- Start with (6, 6, 6)
- Change one side to 3: (6, 6, 3)
- Change another side to 4: (6, 4, 3)
- Change the last side to 3: (3, 4, 3)
- Finally, make all sides equal to 3: (3, 3, 3)

This requires 4 steps, but the code outputs `3`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
