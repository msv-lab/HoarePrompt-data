Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the Least Common Multiple (LCM) approach. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. The `lcm` calculation is incorrect. The formula used in the code does not correctly compute the LCM of three numbers. The LCM of three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by \(\frac{a \times b \times c}{\text{lcm}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(b, c) \times \text{lcm}(a, c)}\). However, the current implementation uses a simplified version that may not always yield the correct result.

2. The `func_1` function is incorrectly named and not used to calculate the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) properly. The function should be renamed to `gcd` and used correctly to compute the LCM.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

lcm_k1_k2 = lcm(k1, k2)
lcm_k2_k3 = lcm(k2, k3)
lcm_k1_k3 = lcm(k1, k3)

lcm_all = lcm(lcm_k1_k2, lcm_k2_k3)

if lcm_all % k1 == 0 and lcm_all % k2 == 0 and lcm_all % k3 == 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the LCM is calculated correctly and checks if it is divisible by all three given values, which is the required condition for Mishka to light at least one garland each second.
