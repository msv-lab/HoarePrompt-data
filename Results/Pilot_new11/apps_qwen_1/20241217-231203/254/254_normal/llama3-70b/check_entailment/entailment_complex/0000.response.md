Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The core issue lies in the function `func_1`, which is meant to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the function incorrectly returns `0` instead of the actual GCD. This logical error leads to an incorrect calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) used in the main part of the program.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to compute the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it incorrectly sets `a` and `b` to `0` after the loop, and then returns `0`. This means the function always returns `0`, regardless of the input values. Therefore, the expression `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))` will always result in `lcm` being `0`, leading to the incorrect conclusion that Mishka can always find a suitable moment to switch on the garlands.

2. **Logical Error in Main Logic**: Given that `lcm` is calculated as `0`, the condition `if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):` will always evaluate to `True` because `0` is divisible by any integer. As a result, the program will always print `YES`, which is incorrect. For instance, consider the input `4 2 3`. The correct answer should be `NO`, but the program will output `YES` due to the logical error in the GCD calculation.

To fix the program, the function `func_1(a, b)` should correctly compute the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm and return the computed value. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    
    return a
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected according to the problem description.
