Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `k_3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k_3 \leq 1500\)**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs as long as `b` is non-zero.
   - In each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated as follows:
     - `a` takes the value of `b`.
     - `b` takes the value of `a % b`.

2. **First Iteration:**
   - If `b` is non-zero, after one iteration:
     - `a` becomes the original value of `b`.
     - `b` becomes `a % b`.

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - After the second iteration:
     - `a` becomes the original value of `b` from the first iteration.
     - `b` becomes `a % b` from the first iteration, which is the original value of `a` modulo the original value of `b`.
   - If the original `b` was non-zero, `a % b` eventually leads to `b` becoming zero because the Euclidean algorithm reduces the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) until `b` is reduced to zero.

4. **Third Iteration:**
   - After the third iteration:
     - `a` remains 0 because `b` became zero in the previous iteration.
     - `b` also becomes 0.

5. **General Case:**
   - This process continues until `b` becomes zero.
   - Once `b` is zero, the loop terminates.
   - At this point, `a` will be the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be zero.

6. **Final Output State:**
   - Since the loop always terminates with `b` becoming zero, the final values are `a` is 0 and `b` is 0.
   - The value of `k_3` remains unchanged and is still within the range \(1 \leq k_3 \leq 1500\).

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:
**`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `k_3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k_3 \leq 1500\)**.
