The code `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` is non-zero. After executing the code:

- `b` is reassigned to its original value, which is the value of `a`.
- `a` is reassigned to `a % b`, which is `a % a` since `b` is now the original value of `a`.

Since `a % a` is always 0 for any non-zero `a`, `a` becomes 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 0, and `b` is the original value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is the original value of `a`**
