The code `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `b` is a non-zero integer, and `k_3` is an integer between 1 and 1500.

- After executing `a, b = b, a % b`, `b` will take the value of `a % b`.
- The value of `a` will be updated to the original value of `b`.

So, `a` will now be equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` will be equal to the original value of `a % b`.

Output State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is `a % b`, and `k_3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k_3 \leq 1500\)**.
