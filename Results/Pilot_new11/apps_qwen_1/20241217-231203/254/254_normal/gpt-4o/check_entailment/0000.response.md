Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether Mishka can choose moments to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three given time intervals. If the GCD is 1, it means that the intervals are coprime, and thus, there will always be a second where at least one garland is lit. Otherwise, if the GCD is greater than 1, there will be gaps where no garland is lit. This logic aligns with the problem description and works for all potential cases within the given constraints.
