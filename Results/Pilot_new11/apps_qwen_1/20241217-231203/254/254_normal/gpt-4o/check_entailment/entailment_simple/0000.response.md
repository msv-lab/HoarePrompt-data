Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads three integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into three separate integers.
   
2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the pairs of integers in sequence:
     - First, it calculates the GCD of \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \).
     - Then, it calculates the GCD of the result of the previous GCD calculation and \( k_3 \). This final GCD is stored in `gcd_all`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the final GCD (`gcd_all`) is equal to 1.
   - If `gcd_all` is 1, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second.
   - If `gcd_all` is not 1, it prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to achieve the desired condition.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Garland Liting Condition**:
  - For at least one garland to be lit every second, the periods at which the garlands change their states must not completely overlap. If the GCD of the periods is greater than 1, it means there will be gaps in the lighting pattern because the lighting intervals will repeat at regular intervals larger than 1 second, leading to some seconds being unlit.

- **GCD Insight**:
  - The GCD of the periods determines the smallest interval at which all three garlands will simultaneously be off. If the GCD is 1, it means that within every period of 1 second, at least one of the garlands will be lit, satisfying the requirement.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Since the problem specifies that the input values \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) are between 1 and 1500, the GCD calculation will always be valid for positive integers in this range. The program handles all valid inputs as expected.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
