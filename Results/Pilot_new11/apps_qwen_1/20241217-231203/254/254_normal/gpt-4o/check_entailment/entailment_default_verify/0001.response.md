Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) is 1. If the GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that Mishka can choose moments to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching them on at least one garland will be lit. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The provided output hints and the examples confirm that the program behaves as expected. The program does not encounter any edge cases that would render it incorrect under the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
