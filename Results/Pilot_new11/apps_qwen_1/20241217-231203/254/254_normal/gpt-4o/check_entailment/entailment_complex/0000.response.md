Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from the input, ensuring they are positive integers within the specified range (1 to 1500). This is handled correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three integers:
   - First, it computes the GCD of \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) using `math.gcd(k1, k2)`.
   - Then, it uses this result to compute the GCD with \( k_3 \) using `math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)`.

3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the final GCD (`gcd_all`) is equal to 1. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to switch the garlands on such that each second after switching them on, at least one garland is lit. If the GCD is not 1, it prints 'NO'.

The logic behind this approach is correct because:
- If the GCD of the three periods is 1, it means that there exists a common pattern where the periods will overlap such that at least one garland is lit every second. This is due to the properties of coprime numbers.
- If the GCD is greater than 1, it indicates that there is a periodicity that skips some seconds, making it impossible to ensure that each second is covered by at least one lit garland.

Thus, the program correctly follows the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
