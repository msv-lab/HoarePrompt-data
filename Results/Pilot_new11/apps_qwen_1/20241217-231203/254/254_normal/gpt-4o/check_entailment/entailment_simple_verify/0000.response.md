Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The program correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three given time intervals and checks if this GCD is 1. If the GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that Mishka can choose moments to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. If the GCD is greater than 1, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to satisfy the condition. The annotated version clearly shows the state of the program at different points and supports the correctness of the program according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as True.
