The code updates `remaining_after_cars` by subtracting `b * car_cost` from `remaining_after_houses`. Here, `b` is defined as `b_prev + 2`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \)
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged
- \( b = b_prev + 2 \)
- `remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 2) * car_cost`

After executing the line:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```
we substitute \( b = b_prev + 2 \) into the equation for `remaining_after_cars`:
\[ remaining\_after\_cars = remaining\_after\_houses - (b\_prev + 2) * car\_cost \]

So, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \)
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged
- \( b = b_prev + 2 \)
- `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 2) * car_cost`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged; \( b = b_prev + 2 \); `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 2) * car_cost`**
