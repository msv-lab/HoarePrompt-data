Output State: **`n` is an integer such that it must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \), `house_cost` remains 1234567, `car_cost` remains 123456, `computer_cost` remains 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - a * 1234567`, if `remaining_after_houses % computer_cost == 0` after the loop, the program returns 'YES', otherwise, the program does not return anything (or returns an unspecified value, as there is no else part provided).**
