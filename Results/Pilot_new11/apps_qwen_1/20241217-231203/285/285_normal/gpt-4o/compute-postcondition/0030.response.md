Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \)
   - `house_cost` is 1234567
   - `car_cost` is 123456
   - `computer_cost` is 1234
   - `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged
   - \( b \) is \( b_prev + 1 \)
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`
   - If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no change in the state of the program variables.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over values of \( b \) from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( b \) was \( b_prev + 1 \).
   - For the next iteration, \( b \) needs to be \( b_prev + 2 \).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - \( n \) remains unchanged as it does not depend on \( b \).
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain unchanged.
   - `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged.
   - \( b \) increases by 1, so it becomes \( b_prev + 2 \).
   - `remaining_after_cars` updates to `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 2) * car_cost`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged; \( b \) is \( b_prev + 2 \); `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 2) * car_cost`.**
