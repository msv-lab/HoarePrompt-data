To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the information provided and the loop statement:

### Provided Information:
- `n` is at least 1234567.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `remaining_after_houses` is calculated as `n - a * 1234567`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the Value of `remaining_after_houses`:**
   - `remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost`.
   - For the loop to execute, `remaining_after_houses` must be non-negative (greater than or equal to 0).

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop Variable `b`:**
   - The loop runs from `b = 0` to `b = remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than 0.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - This translates to \( n - a \times 1234567 \geq 0 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( n \geq a \times 1234567 \).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 1234567.
- We need to ensure that \( n \geq a \times 1234567 \) for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Adjustments:
1. Ensure that `n` is at least \( a \times 1234567 \).
2. Ensure that `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `n` must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \).
- `remaining_after_houses` must be non-negative.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \), `remaining_after_houses` must be non-negative**
