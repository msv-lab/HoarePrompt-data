Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \)
   - `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`
   - `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `b` from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is within this range.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is one less than the value it will take in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `b` will increase by 1 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `n` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop variable `b`.
   - `remaining_after_houses` remains non-negative.
   - `remaining_after_cars` will be recalculated as `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`.
   - Since `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` should not be equal to 0, this condition needs to be checked for the new value of `remaining_after_cars`.

Given these considerations, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `n` must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \)
- `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0

Therefore, the state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \), `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
