The code `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` updates the value of `remaining_after_cars` based on the values of `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `car_cost`. According to the initial state, `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost` remain the same, and `b` is defined as `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0` must still hold true after the update.
- `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged.
- `car_cost` remains unchanged.
- `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

The value of `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that it must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \); `remaining_after_houses` remains the same; `car_cost` remains the same; `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`; `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.**
