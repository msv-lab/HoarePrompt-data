The code assigns the integer value `1234567` to the variable `house_cost`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it in this snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `house_cost` and retains the initial state of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567**
