To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \)
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0

### For Loop Statement:
```
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions for the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for values of `b` starting from 0 up to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `b` must be less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0 (this means `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`).

3. **Determine the Next Value of `b`:**
   - To execute the loop one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `b` should be the current value of `b` plus 1.

4. **Check the New Condition for the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - After incrementing `b`, we need to check if the new value of `b` is still within the range.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `b` needs to be incremented by 1, the new value of `b` will be the current value of `b` + 1.
- We don't need to change `remaining_after_houses`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, or `computer_cost` as they remain unchanged.
- The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` should still hold true after the increment.

### Final State:
- `remaining_after_cars` remains the same.
- `b` is incremented by 1.

So, the final state before the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`; `b` is incremented by 1; `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
