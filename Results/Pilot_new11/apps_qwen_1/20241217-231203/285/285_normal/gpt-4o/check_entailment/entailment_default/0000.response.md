Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required to determine if Kolya could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. The function `func_1` iterates through possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers, checking if the remaining amount of money after purchasing the houses and cars is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer. If such a combination exists, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The code handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
