The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without further execution of the remaining code. This means that no further changes are made to any variables, and the string 'YES' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` and `n` must satisfy `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0`, `b` is `b + 1`, and `c` is \((n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234\), and the condition `a * 1234567 + (b + 1) * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` holds true or does not change; the string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
