The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program execution. This means that any further operations in the current context will not be performed, and the program exits immediately. Since the program exits without performing any further assignments or operations, the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the printed text "YES" is also unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \); `b` is \( b + 1 \); `c` is \( (n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234 \); printed text is 'YES'**
