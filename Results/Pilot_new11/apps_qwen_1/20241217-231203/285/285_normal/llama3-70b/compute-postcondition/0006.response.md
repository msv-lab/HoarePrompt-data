The `exit()` function call terminates the program, and no further code is executed. Therefore, the values of the variables before the `exit()` call remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are also preserved.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` and `n` must satisfy `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0`, `c` is `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, and `(a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234) == n**
