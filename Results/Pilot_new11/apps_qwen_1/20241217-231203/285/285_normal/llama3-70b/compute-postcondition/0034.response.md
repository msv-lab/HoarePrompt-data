The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. This means that no further operations will be performed, and the values of the variables will not be altered. The print statement and the condition check before it are not executed.

Output State: **`a` must satisfy \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \geq 0\); `b` is 1; `c` is equal to \((n - a \times 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`; the program terminates without executing the print statement**
