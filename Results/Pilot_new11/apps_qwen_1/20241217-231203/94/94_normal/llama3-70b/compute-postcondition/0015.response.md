The code assigns the value of `i` to `x2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `x1` is set to the value of `i` if `puzzle1[i]` equals 'X'. Otherwise, `x1` remains unchanged. The code does not provide a specific condition for `x1`, so we consider both possibilities.

Output State: **`i` remains unchanged, `x1` is set to the value of `i` if `puzzle1[i]` equals 'X', otherwise `x1` remains unchanged; `x2` is equal to `i`**
