The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings consisting of four characters each, where the characters are either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', representing a 2x2 grid configuration. Each string contains exactly one 'X', and the characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' appear exactly once each in their respective strings.

After executing the function body, the function returns `True` if `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the same characters in any order, otherwise it returns `False`. The indices `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged, and the 'X' characters in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` have been swapped.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two strings `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, check if they contain the same characters (excluding 'X') in any order, and return `True` if so, otherwise return `False`. The 'X' characters are swapped but do not affect the return value.
