The code swaps the characters at the indices `x1` and `x2` in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Initially, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and `x1` and `x2` are the indices of 'X' in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` respectively.

After the swap, the values of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` will have their 'X' characters swapped. The values of `x1` and `x2` will remain the same because the indices themselves are not being modified, only the characters at those indices are swapped.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` have had their 'X' characters swapped, `x1` is the index of 'X' in the original `puzzle1`, `x2` is the index of 'X' in the original `puzzle2`.**
