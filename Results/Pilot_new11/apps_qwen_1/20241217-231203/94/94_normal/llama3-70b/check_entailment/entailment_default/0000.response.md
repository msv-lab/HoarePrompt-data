Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bessie and Elsie's puzzles can reach the same configuration through a series of valid moves. The function `func_1` only checks if the characters in the puzzle strings, after swapping the 'X' positions, are the same in any order. This is insufficient because the order of the tiles matters, and simply checking if the characters are the same does not ensure that the configurations are achievable through valid moves.

For example, consider the following inputs:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```

In this case, swapping the 'X' positions in the puzzles gives:
```
AC
XB
```

And sorting the characters results in:
```
AC
XB
```

While the characters are the same, the configurations cannot be achieved through valid moves as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` would incorrectly return `True`, indicating that the puzzles can be in the same configuration, which is not the case.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration for every potential case.
