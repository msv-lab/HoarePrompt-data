Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The function `func_1` only performs a single swap of the 'X' character between the two puzzles and then checks if the remaining characters are the same. This approach is insufficient because it does not consider all possible sequences of moves that could transform one puzzle into the other.

For example, consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```

The code will identify the positions of 'X' and swap them, resulting in:
```
AC
XB
```
and
```
AB
CX
```

Then it checks if the remaining characters are the same, which they are not. However, the correct solution involves moving the 'A' tile from Bessie's puzzle to Elsie's puzzle and then moving the 'B' tile, which results in the same configuration:
```
AC
BX
```

This shows that the current implementation is incorrect because it fails to account for all possible sequences of moves. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
