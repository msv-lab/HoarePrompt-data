Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the sliding puzzle moves and check if the configurations can be made equal through a series of valid moves. Instead, it simply checks if the characters in the two puzzle strings, after swapping the 'X' positions, are the same. This approach does not account for the constraints that sliding the tiles must follow (i.e., moving a tile adjacent to the empty cell).

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Simulation of Sliding Moves**: The function `func_1` does not simulate the process of sliding the tiles to see if the configurations can be made equal through valid moves. It only checks if the remaining characters (after swapping the 'X') are the same, which does not guarantee that the configurations can be achieved by valid moves.
2. **Lack of Valid Move Validation**: The function does not validate whether the moves are valid according to the rules of the puzzle. For example, it should check if moving a tile to the empty cell results in a valid configuration, but the current implementation does not perform these checks.
3. **Assumption of Direct Comparison**: By directly comparing the characters after swapping 'X', the function makes an incorrect assumption that if the characters match, the configurations are equivalent. This is not true because the relative positions of 'A', 'B', and 'C' must also match to be considered the same configuration.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
- Identify the position of 'X' in both puzzles.
- Simulate valid moves to see if one puzzle can be transformed into the other.
- Ensure that each move is valid (i.e., only adjacent tiles can move to the empty cell).

Since the provided program does not simulate the valid moves and directly compares the strings, it fails to meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
