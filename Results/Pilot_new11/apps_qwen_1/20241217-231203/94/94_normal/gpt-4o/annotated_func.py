#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle is a string consisting of two rows representing a 2x2 grid. Each row contains exactly two characters, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' represent tiles and 'X' represents the empty cell. There is exactly one 'X' in each puzzle, and each letter appears exactly once in the puzzle string.
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]
    #The program returns the first two characters of the string 'puzzle'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `puzzle` which represents a 2x2 grid with exactly one empty cell ('X') and three unique tiles ('A', 'B', 'C'). It returns the first two characters of the string `puzzle`. This means the function extracts the top-left and top-right cells of the 2x2 grid. Since the grid is always represented as a single string with two rows of two characters, the function will always return the same two characters regardless of their positions, as long as the string is correctly formatted. The function does not handle any edge cases beyond ensuring the input string is in the correct format. If the input string does not conform to the expected format (e.g., more than one 'X', incorrect length, or incorrect character usage), the behavior is undefined as these checks are not implemented within the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the labels of the tiles and 'X' is the empty cell. The string is formed by concatenating the rows, so the valid input format is 'ABXC' for a 2x2 grid.
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        
        empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos
                    ], new_state[empty_pos]
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all unique reachable states from the initial state `start`, `directions` remains as `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` do not exist since the loop has terminated, `empty_pos` does not exist since the loop has terminated, `current` does not exist since the loop has terminated, `new_row` and `new_col` do not exist since the loop has terminated, `new_pos` does not exist since the loop has terminated, `new_state` does not exist since the loop has terminated, `new_state_str` does not exist since the loop has terminated.
    return visited
    #`The program returns the set 'visited' which contains all unique reachable states from the initial state 'start'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `start` representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the labels of the tiles and 'X' is the empty cell. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial state, ensuring that each unique reachable state is visited exactly once. The function returns a set containing all unique reachable states from the initial state `start`.

The function starts by initializing a queue with the initial state and a set to track visited states. It then iterates through each state in the queue, determining the position of the empty cell ('X') and exploring all possible moves within the 2x2 grid boundaries. For each valid move, it generates a new state, adds it to the visited set, and appends it to the queue if it hasn't been visited before. The loop continues until all reachable states have been explored.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the initial state `start` is already in the visited set, the function will not explore any further states.
- If the initial state is not a valid 2x2 sliding puzzle configuration (e.g., not containing exactly one 'X'), the function will either raise an error or behave unpredictably.
- The function assumes that the initial state is a string of length 4, representing a 2x2 grid. Any deviation from this format will result in incorrect behavior or errors.
