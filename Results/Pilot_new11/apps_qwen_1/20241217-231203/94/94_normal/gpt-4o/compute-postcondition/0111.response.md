Postcondition: ***`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list containing the same elements as `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is either added to the set `visited` or the program continues without adding it to `visited` based on whether `new_state_str` was already in `visited` before the execution of the if statement.***
