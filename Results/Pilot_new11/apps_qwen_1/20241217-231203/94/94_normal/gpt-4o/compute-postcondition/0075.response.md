Postcondition: ***`directions` contains at least one element; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` now includes the string representation of `new_state` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`; `queue` now contains the string representation of `new_state` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`.***
