The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. Since `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, the new string `new_state_str` will contain the same characters as `current`, but the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` will be swapped compared to their original positions in `current`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`**
