The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The value of `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`, which is a list equal to `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` contains the original elements plus `new_state_str`, `directions` is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state` and `new_state_str` is in `visited`**
