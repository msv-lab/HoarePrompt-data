The code swaps the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Let's break this down:

- `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are being swapped.
- `new_pos` is a specific value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).
- `new_state` is a list copy of `current`, and the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are being exchanged.

After the swap, the new values of the affected variables are:
- `new_state[empty_pos]` will now hold the value originally at `new_pos`.
- `new_state[new_pos]` will now hold the value originally at `empty_pos`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `directions` contains at least one element.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- `new_state` is a list copy of `current`, but it has been modified by the swap.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`directions` contains at least one element, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
