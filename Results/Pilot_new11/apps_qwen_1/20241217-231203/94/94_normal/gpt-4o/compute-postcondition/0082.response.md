The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. However, the initial values of these variables are not specified in the initial state. We know that `directions` must be a non-empty list, but this does not affect the calculation of `new_row` and `new_col`.

Given the code:
```python
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```

The variables `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated by adding `dr` to `empty_row` and `dc` to `empty_col`. Since the initial values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not specified, we represent them as their respective symbols.

The output state includes the updated values of `new_row` and `new_col`, and the precondition that `directions` must be a non-empty list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` must be a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
