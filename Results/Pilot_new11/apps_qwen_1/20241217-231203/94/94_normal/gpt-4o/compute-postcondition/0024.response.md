The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the `new_state` list into a string using the `join` method with an empty string as the separator. This operation does not change the contents of the `new_state` list itself, only the value of `new_state_str`. 

The initial state includes:
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`
- `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`
- `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped

After executing the code, the `new_state` list remains unchanged, but a new string `new_state_str` is created from the elements of `new_state`.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`**
