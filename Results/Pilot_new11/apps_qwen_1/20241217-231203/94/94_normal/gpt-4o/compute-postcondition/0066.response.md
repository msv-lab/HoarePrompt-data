According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `directions`. The loop continues as long as `directions` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `directions` contains at least one element.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- If `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` holds true, then:
  - `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.
  - `current` is now `new_state`.
  - `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.
  - `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`.
  - `new_state_str` is added to `visited`.

If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, no changes occur. Otherwise, no changes occur.

For the loop to execute one more time, `directions` must still contain at least one element. Since we are not modifying `directions` within the loop, `directions` will still contain at least one element if it did at the start of the current iteration.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged except for the loop condition.

State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.**
