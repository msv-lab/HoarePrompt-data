The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list from the `current` list and assigns it to `new_state`. The values of `directions`, `new_pos`, `new_row`, and `new_col` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current`.**
