Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop iterates over elements in the `directions` list using the tuple `(dr, dc)` as the iterator. For the loop to execute, `directions` must contain at least one element.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `queue` is not empty except for its leftmost element which is no longer in the queue.
   - `current` is equal to the leftmost element that was removed from `queue`.
   - `empty_row` is 1.
   - `empty_col` is 1.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop depends on `directions`, `directions` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `current`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are already given and do not affect the loop's execution directly. However, they might be relevant in the loop body but not necessary for the loop to start.

4. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `directions` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`directions` must contain at least one element**
