The code assigns the value of `new_pos` based on `new_row` and `new_col`. Given the initial conditions, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, both of which are within the range [0, 2). The formula `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` calculates the position in a linearized form of a 2D grid.

Since `new_row` and `new_col` are both within the range [0, 2), `new_pos` will be a value between 0 and 3 (inclusive).

Let's consider the possible values for `new_row` and `new_col`:

- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 0 = 0`.
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1`.
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 2, then `new_pos = 0 * 2 + 2 = 2`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 0 = 2`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3`.
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 2, then `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 2 = 4`.
- If `new_row` is 2 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos = 2 * 2 + 0 = 4`.
- If `new_row` is 2 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5`.
- If `new_row` is 2 and `new_col` is 2, then `new_pos = 2 * 2 + 2 = 6`.

Given that `new_row` and `new_col` are within the specified range, `new_pos` will be one of the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col` (where `new_pos` is one of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)**
