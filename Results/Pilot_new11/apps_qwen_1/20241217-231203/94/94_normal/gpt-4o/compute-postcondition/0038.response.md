Postcondition: ***`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If the new position `(new_row, new_col)` is within bounds (i.e., `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`), then `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list created from `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining all elements in `new_state`; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` now includes `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`. If the new position is out of bounds, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
