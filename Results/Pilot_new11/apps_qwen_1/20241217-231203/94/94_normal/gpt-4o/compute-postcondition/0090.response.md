The code appends `new_state_str` to the queue. This means that `new_state_str` is added to the end of the queue. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state`, `new_state_str` is in `visited`, and `new_state_str` is appended to `queue`.**
