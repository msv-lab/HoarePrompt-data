The code creates a new list `new_state` by copying the contents of the `current` list. However, the actual values of the elements in `new_state` are not specified in the given code snippet. The initial state does not provide specific values for the `current` list, so we cannot determine the exact contents of `new_state`. We only know that `new_state` is a copy of `current`.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list containing the same elements as `current`**
