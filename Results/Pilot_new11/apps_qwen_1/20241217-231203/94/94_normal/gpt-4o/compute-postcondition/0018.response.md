Postcondition: ***`queue` contains the original elements plus `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`. If `new_state_str` is in `visited`, the condition remains unchanged.***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `new_row` and `new_col` are within the specified bounds (0 to 1).
- If the condition is true, `new_state_str` is added to the `queue` if it is not already in `visited`.
- If the condition is false, no action is taken, as indicated by the absence of an else part. Therefore, the state remains unchanged.
