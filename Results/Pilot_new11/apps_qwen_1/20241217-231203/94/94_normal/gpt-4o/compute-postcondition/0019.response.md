According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `(dr, dc)` from the `directions` list. The loop will execute for each pair in the `directions` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `queue` contains the original elements plus `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.
- The condition remains unchanged if `new_state_str` is in `visited`.

To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration, we need to focus on the loop variable `(dr, dc)`:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `queue` contains the original elements plus `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.
   - The condition remains unchanged if `new_state_str` is in `visited`.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, we need to take the next pair `(dr, dc)` from the `directions` list.
   - If `new_state_str` was added to `queue` in the previous iteration, it will remain there for the next iteration unless explicitly removed.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:
- The current `(dr, dc)` pair used in the previous iteration should be removed or moved to the next pair in the `directions` list.
- `queue` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`queue` contains the original elements plus `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`. The next `(dr, dc)` pair from the `directions` list is considered for the loop.**
