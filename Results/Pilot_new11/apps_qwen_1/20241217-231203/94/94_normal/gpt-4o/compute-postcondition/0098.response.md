The code `''.join(new_state)` concatenates the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. This operation does not modify the elements of `new_state` list itself, but it creates a new string from those elements.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the elements at positions `new_pos` and `empty_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` list.**
