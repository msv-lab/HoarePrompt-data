The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This operation does not change the values of `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, or `new_state_str`. The only impact is that `new_state_str` is now present in the set `visited`.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the elements at positions `new_pos` and `empty_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` list, `visited` is a set containing `new_state_str`.**
