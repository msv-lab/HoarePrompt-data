Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly extract the state of the puzzle as required. According to the problem description, the function should return the configuration of the puzzle as a string, but the current implementation simply returns the first two characters of the input string without considering the positions of the tiles and the empty cell. This means that the state returned by `func_1` is incomplete and does not represent the actual configuration of the puzzle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
AB
XC
XA
BC
```

The correct state of Bessie's puzzle is "ABXC", and the correct state of Elsie's puzzle is "AXBC". However, the function `func_1` will incorrectly return "AB" and "AX" respectively, which does not match the required format.

Additionally, the function `func_2` performs a breadth-first search to find all reachable states from the initial state. While this part of the implementation seems correct, the issue with `func_1` means that the initial states used in the BFS are incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
