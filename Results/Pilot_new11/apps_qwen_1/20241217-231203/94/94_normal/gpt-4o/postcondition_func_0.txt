The function `func_1` accepts a string `puzzle` which represents a 2x2 grid with exactly one empty cell ('X') and three unique tiles ('A', 'B', 'C'). It returns the first two characters of the string `puzzle`. This means the function extracts the top-left and top-right cells of the 2x2 grid. Since the grid is always represented as a single string with two rows of two characters, the function will always return the same two characters regardless of their positions, as long as the string is correctly formatted. The function does not handle any edge cases beyond ensuring the input string is in the correct format. If the input string does not conform to the expected format (e.g., more than one 'X', incorrect length, or incorrect character usage), the behavior is undefined as these checks are not implemented within the function.
