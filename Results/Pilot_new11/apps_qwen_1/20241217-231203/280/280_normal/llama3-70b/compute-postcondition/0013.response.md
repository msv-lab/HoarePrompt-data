The code changes the value of `min_speed` to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. According to the initial state, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. Since `min_speed` cannot exceed `max_speed`, `min_speed` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the value of `min_speed` does not change from its initial value, which is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100; `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is at least 2; `d` is an integer between 0 and 10; `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t + min_speed`; `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`; `i` is 2**
