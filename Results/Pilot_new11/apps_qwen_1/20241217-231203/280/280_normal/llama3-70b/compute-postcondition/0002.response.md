The code assigns the maximum value between `v1` and `v2` to `max_speed`. Since `v1` and `v2` are integers between 1 and 100, `max_speed` will take the larger of the two values. The values of `t`, `d`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers (1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100) and equal to the integers entered by the user; `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), now equal to `user_t`; `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), now equal to `user_d`; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.**
