The code `max_length = max_speed * t` assigns the value of `max_speed * t` to `max_length`. The previous values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, and the new variable `max_length` are updated based on this calculation.

- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.
- `min_speed` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `d` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`v1` is an integer (1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100), `v2` is an integer (1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100); `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100); `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10); `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed * t`.**
