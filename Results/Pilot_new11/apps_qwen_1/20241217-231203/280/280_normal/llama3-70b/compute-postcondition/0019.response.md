The code `max_length += max_speed` increases `max_length` by `max_speed`. According to the initial state, `max_length` was already incremented by `max_speed` twice. Therefore, `max_length` is now incremented by `max_speed` one more time.

The output state is:

Output State: **`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t + 2 * min_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` three times, `i` is 2**
