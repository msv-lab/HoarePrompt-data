The code `t, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `t` and `d` respectively. This means that `t` and `d` are now updated to the values entered by the user, while `v1`, `v2`, and the original `t` (which is now updated) are affected. The initial conditions for `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, but the original `t` is replaced by the new value.

Since the exact values of the inputs are not specified, let's denote the user's inputs as `user_t` and `user_d`. Therefore, `t` is now `user_t` and `d` is `user_d`.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers (1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100) and equal to the integers entered by the user; `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100), now equal to `user_t`; `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10), now equal to `user_d`.**
