Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the way the speeds are calculated does not ensure that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed `d` in absolute value, especially in cases where the initial and final speeds are far apart and `d` is small.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 9
3 2
```
According to the problem description, the speeds should change by at most 2 meters per second between adjacent seconds. However, the current implementation does not enforce this constraint properly. The speeds are calculated as follows:
- `speeds[0] = 5`
- `speeds[1] = min(5 + 2, 9 + 2) = 7`
- `speeds[2] = min(7 + 2, 9 + 1) = 9`

This calculation allows for an increase of 4 meters per second from the first to the third second, which violates the constraint that the speed change between adjacent seconds should not exceed 2 meters per second.

To fix this, the speeds should be adjusted to ensure that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed `d`. One way to achieve this is to calculate the speeds in a way that gradually increases or decreases the speed by at most `d` each second until the final speed is reached.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize the speeds list
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    
    # Calculate the speeds for each second
    for i in range(1, t - 1):
        if speeds[i - 1] < v2:
            speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 - (t - i - 1) * d)
        else:
            speeds[i] = max(speeds[i - 1] - d, v2 + (i - 1) * d)
    
    # Ensure the last speed is exactly v2
    speeds[-2] = v2 - d if speeds[-2] > v2 - d else v2 - d
    
    # Calculate the total distance
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed `d` in absolute value, thus meeting the problem requirements for every potential case.
