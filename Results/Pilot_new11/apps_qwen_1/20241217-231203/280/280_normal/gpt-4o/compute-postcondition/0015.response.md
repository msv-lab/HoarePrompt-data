Functionality: **The function accepts two initial speeds `v_1` and `v_2` (integers within the range [1, 100]), a time duration `t` (an integer within the range [2, 100]), and a speed increment `d` (an integer within the range [0, 10]). It then calculates a list of speeds for each time step from 0 to `t-1`, ensuring that the speeds do not exceed `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. The first speed in the list is set to `v_1`, and the last speed is set to `v_2`. After calculating the speeds, it computes the total distance traveled based on these speeds and prints the result. Potential edge cases include the minimum speed not being updated correctly if `d` is 0, and the maximum speed exceeding `v_2` if `d` is large enough.**
