The code initializes a list `speeds` with `t` elements, all set to 0. The value of `t` is determined by the first integer input, and the value of `d` remains unchanged. The initial values of `v1` (which is `a`) and `v2` (which is `b`) are not affected.

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is the first integer input, `d` is the second integer input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements, all set to 0.**
