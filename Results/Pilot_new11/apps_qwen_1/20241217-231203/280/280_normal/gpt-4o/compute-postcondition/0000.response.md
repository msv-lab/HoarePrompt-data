The code `v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `v1` and `v2`. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Let's denote the input integers as `a` and `b` (since the actual values are not specified in the initial state). After the input, `v1` will be assigned the value of `a`, and `v2` will be assigned the value of `b`.

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10**
