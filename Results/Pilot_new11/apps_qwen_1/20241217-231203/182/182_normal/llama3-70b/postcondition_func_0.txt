The function takes an integer input `x` representing a camera angle in degrees, where positive values denote clockwise rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation. It then computes and prints the equivalent rotation angle within the range of -359 to 359 degrees. Specifically, it first normalizes `x` using modulo 360 to ensure it falls within this range. If `x` is exactly 0, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints one of 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the normalized value of `x` adjusted by adding 90 and then taking modulo 90 and finally modulo 4.
