Functionality: **The function takes an integer input `x` representing a camera angle in degrees, where positive values denote clockwise rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation. It then computes and prints the equivalent rotation angle within the range of -359 to 359 degrees. Specifically, it first normalizes `x` using modulo 360 to ensure it falls within this range. If `x` is exactly 0, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints one of 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the normalized value of `x` adjusted by adding 90 and then taking modulo 90 and finally modulo 4.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If the input `x` is exactly 0, the function correctly prints 0.
- If the input `x` is any multiple of 90 (e.g., 90, -90, 180, -180), the function will adjust these values to fall within the range [0, 3] when printed.
- If the input `x` is a value not aligned with multiples of 90 (e.g., 45, -45, 135, -135), the function will map these values to either 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the modulo operation.

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. If returning a value is required, the function should have a return statement to output the computed angle.
