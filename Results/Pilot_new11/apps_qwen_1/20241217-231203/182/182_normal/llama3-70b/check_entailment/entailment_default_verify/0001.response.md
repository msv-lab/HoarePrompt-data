Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation of the image from vertical. The output hints confirm that the program first normalizes the input angle using modulo 360 and then calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required. The formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` ensures that the result is always between 0 and 3, corresponding to 0, 1, 2, or 3 turns respectively. The examples provided in the problem description and the output hints align with the program's behavior, confirming its correctness.
