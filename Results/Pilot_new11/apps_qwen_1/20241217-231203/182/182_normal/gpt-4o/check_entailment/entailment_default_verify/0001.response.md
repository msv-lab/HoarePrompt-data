Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the provided code and output hints, the program correctly handles both positive and negative angles by normalizing the input angle to a value between 0 and 360 degrees. The calculation to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns to minimize the deviation from vertical is also correct. The revised code:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = (x + 360) % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```
ensures that negative angles are converted to their positive equivalents before normalization, thus addressing the original assessment's concern. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all input ranges, including handling negative angles correctly. Therefore, the original assessment, which suggested the program did not handle negative angles correctly, is no longer accurate. The program now meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
