Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly normalizes the input angle to a range of 0 to 360 degrees using `x % 360`. It then calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical by determining how much to rotate the image to get the smallest possible deviation from vertical. The expression `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` ensures that the correct number of turns is calculated, handling both positive and negative input angles appropriately. The output hints align with this functionality, confirming that the program correctly processes inputs within the specified range and accounts for negative angles by normalizing them. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
