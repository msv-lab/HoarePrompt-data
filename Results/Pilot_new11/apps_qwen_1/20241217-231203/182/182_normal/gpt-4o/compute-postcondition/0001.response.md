The code snippet `normalized_angle = x % 360` takes the integer `x` and calculates its remainder when divided by 360, assigning this value to `normalized_angle`. Since `x` is an integer within the range \([-10^{18}, 10^{18}]\), the value of `normalized_angle` will be in the range \([0, 359]\). The initial value of `x` is replaced by this new value.

Output State: **`x` is replaced by its value modulo 360; `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`**
