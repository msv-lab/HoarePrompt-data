The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the constraints given for `x`.

Since there are no parameters passed to the function, we need to consider the constraints directly related to the function's behavior.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the constraint that `x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.**
