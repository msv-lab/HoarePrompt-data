Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the rules for skipping commands and returning to the parent node when a destination node is already visited or when reaching a non-exit leaf node. The program assumes that `n` is the index of the exit node and directly calculates the number of steps based on the binary representation of `n - 1`. This approach does not account for the actual traversal rules and can lead to incorrect results for certain values of `h` and `n`.

For example, consider the input `(h, n) = (2, 3)`. According to the problem description, the traversal path would be "LR", visiting nodes 0 (root), 1 (left child of root), 3 (right child of root). However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of visited nodes as 5, which is not consistent with the described algorithm.
