Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly simulate the game's algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not account for the rules where Amr skips commands if the destination node is already visited and returns to the parent node under certain conditions. Instead, the code simply interprets the binary representation of `n-1` to traverse the tree, which does not follow the full algorithm specified.

For instance, consider the input `h=2` and `n=3`. According to the problem description, Amr follows the path "LRLRLRL...". Starting from the root, the path would be:
1. Move left (L): Visit node 1.
2. Move right (R): Visit node 3 (the exit).
3. Move left (L): Return to node 1.
4. Move right (R): Move to node 2.
5. Move left (L): Return to node 1.
6. Move right (R): Move to node 3 (exit).

The total nodes visited (excluding the exit) are 5. However, the code would incorrectly calculate the number of nodes visited as 3 because it does not handle the skipping and returning to parent nodes as specified in the algorithm.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the specified algorithm and hence the correctness is **False**.
