The code `h, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `h` and `n` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\), these constraints are maintained after the input is processed.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); input is read and split into `h` and `n`.**
