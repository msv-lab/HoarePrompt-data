The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The provided parameter constraints and relationships are for `h` and `n`, but these are not used within the function signature. 

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined, we can only infer that the function does not use `h` and `n` as parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept no parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters.**
