The code `h, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `h` and `n` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\), after executing this line of code, the values of `h` and `n` will be the integers entered as input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 2^`h`.**
