Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\) inclusive. It calculates and returns an integer value based on the following process:**

1. The function reads two integers `h` and `n` from user input.
2. It initializes a variable `ans` to 0.
3. It enters a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 1.
4. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, it adds \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\) to `ans`. If `n` is odd, it adds \(\frac{n}{2}\) to `ans`.
5. After updating `ans`, it divides `n` by 2 (using integer division).
6. The loop continues until `n` becomes 1.
7. Once the loop ends, the function prints the final value of `ans`.

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `n` is initially 1, the loop will not execute, and `ans` will remain 0.
- The function does not handle invalid inputs for `h` and `n` beyond the specified ranges. If the user provides values outside these ranges, the behavior is undefined.

After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows:
- The function returns the integer value of `ans`, which is the sum of \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\) for even `n` and \(\frac{n}{2}\) for odd `n` over all iterations until `n` becomes 1.
