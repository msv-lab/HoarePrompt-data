Output State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is 1 (since `n` will eventually become 1 due to the loop condition), `ans` is updated based on the value of `n` at each iteration: if `n` was even, `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 - 1`; otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2`. The final value of `ans` is the sum of these updates.**
