`ans` is assigned the value of itself plus `n // 2`. Since `n` is an odd number, dividing `n` by 2 using integer division (`//`) results in the floor value of `n / 2`, which is `(n - 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\) and `n` is an odd number, `ans` is `ans + (n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\) and `n` is an odd number, `ans` is `ans + (n - 1) // 2`**
