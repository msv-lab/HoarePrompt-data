The function `func` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. The parameter `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and the parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h. 

Case_1: `n` is an integer within the specified range for `n`. The function returns an integer.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `h` and `n`, where `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive, and return an integer.
