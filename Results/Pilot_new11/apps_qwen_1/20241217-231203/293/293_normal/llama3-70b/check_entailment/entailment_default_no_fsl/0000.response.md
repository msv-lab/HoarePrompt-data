Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code assumes a certain pattern in how nodes are visited, which is not aligned with the actual traversal rules described. For instance, the code does not handle the cases where Amr skips commands or returns to the parent node after visiting a leaf node that is not the exit. The code only updates the `ans` variable based on whether `n` is even or odd, which does not accurately reflect the number of nodes Amr visits according to the specified algorithm. This discrepancy leads to incorrect outputs for various test cases, as demonstrated by the examples provided.
