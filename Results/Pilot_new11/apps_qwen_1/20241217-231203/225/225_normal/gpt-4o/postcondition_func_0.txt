The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input, which consists of capital English letters and can contain only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. It calculates and returns the maximum distance between consecutive vowels in the string. If there are no vowels in the string, it returns 1. The function iterates through the string, tracking the positions of vowels and updating the maximum jump distance accordingly. After completing the iteration, it ensures that the maximum jump distance is updated to include the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if necessary. The final state of the program is such that the variable `max_jump` holds the maximum distance between consecutive vowels or the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if no consecutive vowels were found.
