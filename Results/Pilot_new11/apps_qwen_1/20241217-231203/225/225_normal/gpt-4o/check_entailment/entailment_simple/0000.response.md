Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why it works as expected:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program takes a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters as input. This matches the problem description which states that the input is a non-empty string of capital English letters.

2. **Vowel Identification**:
   - The program identifies the positions of vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y') in the string. It correctly initializes a set of vowels and iterates through the string to find these vowels.

3. **Jump Calculation**:
   - The variable `max_jump` keeps track of the maximum jump length required. Initially, it is set to 1 because even if the string consists entirely of consonants, the Grasshopper needs to make at least one jump (of length 1) to reach the end.
   - For each vowel encountered, the program calculates the difference between the current position and the previous vowel's position. This difference represents the length of the jump made by the Grasshopper to reach this vowel.
   - The program updates `max_jump` with the maximum of its current value and the calculated jump length.
   - After the loop, it ensures that the last segment from the last vowel to the end of the string is considered by taking the difference between the length of the string and the position of the last vowel (`len(s) - prev_pos`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program returns `max_jump`, which is the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, thus ensuring that the output meets the requirements specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
