Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the far end of the string by jumping only on vowels. Here's why:

1. The program initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1.
2. It iterates through each character of the string, checking if it is a vowel.
3. When a vowel is found, it updates `max_jump` to the maximum of its current value and the distance between the current position and the previous vowel position.
4. Finally, it updates `max_jump` again to account for the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
5. This approach ensures that the maximum jump length needed to cover all segments between vowels and to the end of the string is calculated correctly.

Since the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and no edge cases were identified where the program would fail, the correctness is **True**.
