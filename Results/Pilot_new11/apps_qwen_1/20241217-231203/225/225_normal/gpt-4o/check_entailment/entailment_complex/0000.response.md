Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program accepts a string `s` as input, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The input is assumed to be valid (non-empty and composed of capital English letters).

2. **Vowel Identification**:
   - The set `vowels` contains the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'.
   - The program correctly identifies these characters as the only vowels in the string.

3. **Jump Ability Calculation**:
   - The variable `max_jump` is initialized to 1, which handles the edge case where there are no vowels in the string.
   - The program iterates through the string and updates `max_jump` to be the maximum distance between consecutive vowels. This ensures that the Grasshopper can jump to the next vowel.
   - After the loop, the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string is checked and included in `max_jump`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no vowels in the string, the initial value of `max_jump` (which is 1) remains unchanged, ensuring the output is 1 as required.
   - If the string consists entirely of vowels, the distance between each pair of consecutive vowels (or the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string) will be calculated correctly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program returns the calculated `max_jump`, which is the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string by jumping only on vowels.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
