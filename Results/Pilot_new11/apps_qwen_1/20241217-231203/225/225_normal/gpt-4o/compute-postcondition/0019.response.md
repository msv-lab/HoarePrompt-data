The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100. The string contains only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels. The function calculates `max_jump`, which is the maximum of its current value and the length of `s` minus the last position of a vowel (`len(s) - prev_pos`), where `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, and `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `max_jump` based on the described calculation.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, returns `max_jump` which is the maximum of its current value and the length of `s` minus the last position of a vowel (`len(s) - prev_pos`), where `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.**
