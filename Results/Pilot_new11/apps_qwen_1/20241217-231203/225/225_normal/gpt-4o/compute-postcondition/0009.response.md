The code updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and `i - prev_pos`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0)
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
- If `s[1]` is in the set `vowels`, `prev_pos` is 0, otherwise `prev_pos` is -1

Let's consider both cases for `prev_pos`:

1. **Case 1: `prev_pos` is 0**
   - `max_jump` is initially 1 (since `max_jump` is 1 and `i - prev_pos` would be `1 - 0 = 1`)
   - After executing `max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)`, the new value of `max_jump` remains 1 (since `1 - 0` equals 1 and it is not greater than the current `max_jump`).

2. **Case 2: `prev_pos` is -1**
   - `max_jump` is initially 1 (since `max_jump` is 1 and `i - prev_pos` would be `1 - (-1) = 2`)
   - After executing `max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)`, the new value of `max_jump` becomes 2 (since `2` is greater than the current `max_jump` which is 1).

Since the exact value of `prev_pos` is dependent on `s[1]`, which is not specified in the problem, we will consider both possibilities. However, the code will definitively update `max_jump` based on the condition.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 2 if `s[1]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 1.**
