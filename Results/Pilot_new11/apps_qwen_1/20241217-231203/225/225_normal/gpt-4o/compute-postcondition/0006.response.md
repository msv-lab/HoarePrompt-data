`prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is in the set `vowels`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is in the set `vowels`**
