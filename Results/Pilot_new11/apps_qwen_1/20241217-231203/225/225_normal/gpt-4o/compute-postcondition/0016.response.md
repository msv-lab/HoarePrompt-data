Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum difference between the index of any vowel in `s` and the index of the previous vowel in `s`. If there are no vowels in `s`, `max_jump` remains 1, `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.**
