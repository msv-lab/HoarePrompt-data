`max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_jump`) and `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0 and the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel, `i + 1` is 1. Given that `max_jump` was initially 0, the new value of `max_jump` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel, and the condition `last_vowel == -1` is true**
