The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of the string `s` is stored in `n`, while the string `s` itself and the constant `vowels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **the input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100; `s` is the input string; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of `s`**
