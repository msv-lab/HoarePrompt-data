`max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Given that `last_vowel` is either 0 or -1 and `i` is 1, let's evaluate the expression:

- If `last_vowel` is 0, then `(1 - 0) // 2 + 1 = 1`.
- If `last_vowel` is -1, then `(1 - (-1)) // 2 + 1 = 2`.

Since `max_jump` can only be either 1 or 0 initially, and the new value of `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` can be 1 or 2, the updated `max_jump` will be 2 because 2 is greater than both 0 and 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 2, `last_vowel` is either 0 or -1, `i` is 1**
