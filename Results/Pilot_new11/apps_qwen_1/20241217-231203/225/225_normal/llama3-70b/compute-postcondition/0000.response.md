The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters and only contains the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y', the variable `s` will hold this string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **the input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100; `s` is the input string**
