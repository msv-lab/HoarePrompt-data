The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_jump`) and `i + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `max_jump` is either 1 or 0, the new value of `max_jump` will be 1 because `i + 1` equals 2, which is greater than both 1 and 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is either 0 or -1, `i` is 1.
