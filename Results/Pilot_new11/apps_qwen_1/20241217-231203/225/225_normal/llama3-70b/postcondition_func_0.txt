The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, containing only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels. It calculates and prints the maximum jump distance between consecutive vowels in the string. A "jump distance" is defined as half the number of characters between two vowels, rounded up. If there are no vowels in the string, the function prints 0. If the last character of the string is a vowel and there is no other vowel before it, the function correctly considers the distance from the start of the string to this vowel.
