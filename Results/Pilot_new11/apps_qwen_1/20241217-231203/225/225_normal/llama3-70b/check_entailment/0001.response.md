Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the beginning to the end of the string, landing only on vowels. The logic is sound:

1. It initializes `max_jump` to store the maximum jump length encountered.
2. It iterates through each character of the string, checking if it is a vowel.
3. If it finds a vowel, it updates `max_jump` to ensure it captures the longest gap between consecutive vowels.
4. Finally, it checks the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string and updates `max_jump` accordingly.

This approach ensures that the Grasshopper can always land on the next vowel, and the maximum jump length required to do so is correctly calculated. The program handles all potential cases, including strings with no vowels, single-vowel strings, and strings with multiple vowels spaced out evenly or unevenly.
