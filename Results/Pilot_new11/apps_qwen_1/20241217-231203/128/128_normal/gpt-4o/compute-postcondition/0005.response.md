Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `days` is a list of \( n \) tuples, each tuple containing two elements \( k \) and \( l \).
   - `regular_sales` is a list containing one element, which is the minimum of \( k \) and \( l \) from the first iteration.
   - `potential_sales_increase` contains an additional element based on the relationship between \( k \) and \( l \).

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each tuple in the `days` list. For each iteration, the tuple \((k, l)\) is unpacked.

3. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume we have completed one iteration of the loop.
   - `days` still contains \( n \) tuples, but now it has been reduced by one since one tuple has been processed.
   - `regular_sales` still contains one element, which is the minimum of \( k \) and \( l \) from the first iteration.
   - `potential_sales_increase` has one additional element based on the relationship between \( k \) and \( l \) from the first iteration.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one tuple remaining in the `days` list.
   - `regular_sales` remains unchanged as it only updates once with the minimum value from the first iteration.
   - `potential_sales_increase` gains another element based on the relationship between \( k \) and \( l \) from the next tuple.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The number of tuples in `days` reduces by one.
   - `regular_sales` remains the same.
   - `potential_sales_increase` gets another element based on the next \( k \) and \( l \).

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`days` is a list of \( n-1 \) tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing one element which is the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration, `potential_sales_increase` contains two elements which are either `l - k`, `k`, or another expression depending on the relationship between `k` and `l`.**
