`regular_sales` is updated by appending the minimum value of `k` and `l` to the existing list. The `potential_sales_increase` and `days` lists remain unchanged.

Let's denote the current value of `k` and `l` as they will be used to determine the new element to append to `regular_sales`.

Before the code execution:
- `regular_sales` contains two elements, each being the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration.
- `potential_sales_increase` contains two elements: `m` and either `2 * k - m` or `l - m` depending on the relationship between `2 * k` and `l`.
- `days` is a list of \( n-2 \) tuples.

After the code execution:
- `regular_sales` now has three elements: the first two elements are the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration, and the third element is the minimum of `k` and `l` from the current iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`days` is a list of \( n-2 \) tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration and the third element is the minimum of `k` and `l` from the current iteration, `potential_sales_increase` contains two elements which are `m` and either `2 * k - m` or `l - m` depending on the relationship between `2 * k` and `l`.**
