To determine the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `days` is a list of \( n-1 \) tuples.
   - `regular_sales` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration.
   - `potential_sales_increase` contains two elements which are `m` and either `2 * k - m` or `l - m` depending on the relationship between `2 * k` and `l`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(k, l)` in the list `days`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but it processes each tuple `(k, l)`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `k` and `l` are the values of the current tuple being processed.
   - The list `regular_sales` still contains the same two elements, as they are determined only from the first iteration.
   - The list `potential_sales_increase` contains two elements based on the current `(k, l)` tuple.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `(k, l)` must be taken from the list `days`.
   - Since `days` is a list of \( n-1 \) tuples, and we have already processed one tuple, there are \( n-2 \) tuples left.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `days` is a list of \( n-2 \) tuples (since one tuple has been processed).
- `regular_sales` remains unchanged, containing two elements which are the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration.
- `potential_sales_increase` now contains two elements based on the next `(k, l)` tuple in the list.

Thus, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`days` is a list of \( n-2 \) tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing two elements both of which are the minimum of `k` and `l` from the first iteration, `potential_sales_increase` contains two elements which are `m` and either `2 * k - m` or `l - m` depending on the relationship between `2 * k` and `l`.**
