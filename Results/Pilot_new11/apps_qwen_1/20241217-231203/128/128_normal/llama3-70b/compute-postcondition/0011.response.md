Output State: **`days` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains two integers (`k_i`, `l_i`) for `i` in range `n`, `n` is an integer such that `0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `f` is an integer such that `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, and remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **Days List:** The loop runs `n` times, and each iteration appends a tuple `(k, l)` to the `days` list. Since the loop runs `n` times, `days` will contain `n` tuples.
- **n Value:** Initially, `n` is defined as an integer between `1` and `10^5`. After the loop runs `n` times, `n` will be reduced to `0` because `n` is decremented by `1` each time the loop runs (as seen in the output states for 2 and 3 iterations).
- **f Value:** The value of `f` remains unchanged throughout the loop since no operation is performed on `f` inside the loop.

Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, `days` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the values of `k` and `l` read from the input. `n` will be `0`, and `f` will retain its original value.
