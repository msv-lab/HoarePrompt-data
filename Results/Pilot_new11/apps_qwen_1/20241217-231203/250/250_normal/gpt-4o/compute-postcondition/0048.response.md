Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list with at least one element, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` contains either `mark + x` if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, otherwise `new_marks` remains unchanged and no elements other than those specified are added to it. Additionally, the condition `(mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set)` is satisfied.***
