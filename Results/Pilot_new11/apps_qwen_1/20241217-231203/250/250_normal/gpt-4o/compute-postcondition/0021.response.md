Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `True`, and `x_found` is `True`. After executing the if-else block, if `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, if `x_found` and `y_found` are not both `True`, the conditions remain unchanged.***
