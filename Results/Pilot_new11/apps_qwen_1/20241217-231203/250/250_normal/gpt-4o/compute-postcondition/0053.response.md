Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `marks` is a list with at least one element.
- `y_found` remains `False`.
- `new_marks` contains specific values based on conditions involving `mark`, `x`, and `y`, or remains unchanged if no conditions are met.

### Loop Statement
```python
for mark in marks:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list. For the loop to continue, there must be at least one element left in the `marks` list.

2. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration, we need to remove the current `mark` from the `marks` list.
   - `y_found` remains `False`.
   - `new_marks` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop has not yet processed this new `mark`.

### New States After One More Iteration of the Loop
- The `marks` list will have one less element than before the loop started.
- `y_found` remains `False`.
- `new_marks` remains unchanged from its previous state.

### Final Answer
State: **`marks` is a list with at least one less element than before, `y_found` is False, `new_marks` contains the same elements as before.** 

However, since we are only asked to describe the state of the `marks` list and `y_found`, the most relevant adjustment is:

State: **`marks` is a list with at least one less element than before, `y_found` is False.**
