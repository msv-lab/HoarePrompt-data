The code adds `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. The variable `x_found` remains unchanged, and the precondition about `marks_set` is also unaffected.

Output State: **`marks` is a list with at least one element, `x_found` is False, `new_marks` contains `mark + x`, there exists an element in `marks_set` such that either `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` matches this element.**
