Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list with at least two less elements than before, `y_found` is `False`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is found in `marks_set`, then `marks` will contain all its original elements plus `mark - x`. Otherwise, `marks` will remain unchanged with all its original elements plus `mark - x`.***
