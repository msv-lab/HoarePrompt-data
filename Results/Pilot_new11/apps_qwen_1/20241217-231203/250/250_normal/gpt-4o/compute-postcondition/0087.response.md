The code `print(len(result))` prints the length of the list `result`. Since `result` was initially defined as `[x, y]` and `y_found` is `False`, the length of `result` remains 2 because the condition `if y_found:` was not met, and thus the list did not get modified further.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that may contain any number of elements, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `marks_set` is the set of unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `result` is a list containing the values `[x, y]`, and the output of the program is `2`.**
