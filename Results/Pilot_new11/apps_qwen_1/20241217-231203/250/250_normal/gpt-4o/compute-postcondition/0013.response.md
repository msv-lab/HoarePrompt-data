The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the snippet, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional context.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`marks`, `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`) are altered by the `break` statement. Thus, the values of these variables remain as they were initially.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.**
