Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`. If `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
