Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.*** 

Explanation: Since the `if` condition `x_found and y_found` is true in the if part, the postcondition of the if part is directly adopted as the overall postcondition of the if-else block. There is no modification in the variables `x_found` and `y_found` when there is no else part, so the postcondition remains unchanged.
