The code adds `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. Given the initial conditions, the following variables are affected:

- `new_marks` is a set that now includes the value `mark - x`.
- `marks` remains unchanged as the code does not interact with this list.
- `x_found` remains `False` as there is no condition in the code that would change its value.
- The conditions regarding the presence of certain expressions in `marks_set` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `new_marks` contains the element `mark - x`.
- `marks` is unchanged.
- `x_found` remains `False`.
- The conditions about the elements in `marks_set` are unchanged.

Output State: **`new_marks` contains the element `mark - x`, `marks` is a list with at least one element, `x_found` is False, and the conditions regarding the presence of certain expressions in `marks_set` remain unchanged.**
