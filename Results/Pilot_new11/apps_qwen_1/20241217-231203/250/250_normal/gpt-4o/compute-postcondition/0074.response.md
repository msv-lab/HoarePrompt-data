Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list with at least two less elements than before. If `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is found in `marks_set`, then `marks` will contain the element `mark + x`. Otherwise, `marks` will contain the element `mark - x`. Additionally, if `mark - y - x` is found in `marks_set`, then `marks` will also contain the element `mark + x`. If none of these conditions are met, `marks` will only contain the elements `mark - x` and `mark - x`.***
