The line `y_found = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `y_found`. Since this is the only change made to the variables, the output state will reflect this update while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `True`, `x_found` is `True`, and `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list.**
