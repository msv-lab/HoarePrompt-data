Postcondition: **`marks` is a list with at least two less elements than before, `y_found` is `False`. If `mark + x + y` is found in `marks_set` or `mark + x - y` is found in `marks_set` or `mark - x + y` is found in `marks_set`, then `marks` will contain the element `mark + x`. Otherwise, `marks` will contain the element `mark - x` if neither `mark - x + y` nor `mark - x - y` is found in `marks_set`.**
