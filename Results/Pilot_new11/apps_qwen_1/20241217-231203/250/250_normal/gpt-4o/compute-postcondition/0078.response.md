The code `print(new_marks.pop())` removes and returns the last element of the `new_marks` set. Since `new_marks` is non-empty, the last element is removed and printed. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that may contain any number of elements, `y_found` is `False` or `True`, `new_marks` is the set of elements derived from the operations involving `x` and `y` with the last element removed, `marks_set` is the set of unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, and `1` is printed to the console.**
