Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that may contain any number of elements, `y_found` is `False` or `True`, `new_marks` is either the set of elements derived from the operations involving `x` and `y` with the last element removed (if `new_marks` is true in the if condition), or an empty set (if `new_marks` is false in the else condition), `marks_set` is the set of unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True` or `False`, `x` is a positive integer or `1`, `y` is a positive integer or `1`, and `1` is printed to the console if `new_marks` is true. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing the values `[1, 1]`.***
