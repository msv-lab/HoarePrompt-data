Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle scenarios where neither `x` nor `y` can be measured with the existing marks, and it does not always find the minimal set of new marks needed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
Input:
2 300 185 230
0 300
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
185 230
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
0
```

This is because the program checks for the existence of `x` or `y` in the set of marks but does not account for the scenario where neither `x` nor `y` can be directly derived from the existing marks and needs to be inserted. The program also does not ensure that the solution is minimal.
