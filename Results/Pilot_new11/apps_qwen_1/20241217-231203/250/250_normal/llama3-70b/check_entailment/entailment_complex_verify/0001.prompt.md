You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider that the additional marks might need to be placed in a way that allows both distances \(x\) and \(y\) to be measured, rather than just adding the marks individually.

Consider the following case:

Input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```

Expected output:
```
2
185 230
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because the program does not attempt to place the marks in a way that allows both \(x\) and \(y\) to be measured simultaneously. It only checks if either \(x\) or \(y\) can be measured with the current marks and does not generate the necessary additional marks to satisfy both conditions.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that both distances \(x\) and \(y\) can be measured after adding the necessary marks. The corrected approach would involve checking all possible pairs of marks and their differences to determine the minimum set of additional marks needed to cover both distances \(x\) and \(y\).

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, l, x, and y are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, and a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n = l.
def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is an index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.
    additional_marks = []
    if (not need_x) :
        additional_marks.append(x)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is an index less than `n`. `need_x` is `False`. `need_y` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`.
    if (not need_y) :
        additional_marks.append(y)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is an index less than `n`. `need_x` is `False`. `need_y` is `False`. `additional_marks` is a list containing both `x` and `y`.
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is an index less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `marks` is a list that initially contains unique elements and may be modified by appending new elements during the loop, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks` for any `j` in `additional_marks`.
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` through user input, where `n` is the number of elements in a sequence, `l` is the last element of the sequence, and `x` and `y` are two integers within the range of the sequence such that `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`. It then reads a sequence of `n` integers from user input, stored in a set called `marks`. The function checks if there exist pairs `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. If no such pairs exist for `x` or `y`, the missing value is added to a list called `additional_marks`. The function then iterates over each element in `marks` and adds to `additional_marks` any values `i + j` that are within the range `[0, l]` and not already present in `marks`. Finally, the function prints the length of `additional_marks` and the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces. Potential edge cases include when `x` or `y` are not present in any pair, and the function correctly handles these by adding them to `additional_marks`. The function also ensures that all elements in `additional_marks` are unique.
