Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop structure**: The loop is structured as follows:
   ```python
   for i in marks:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This means that `i` will take on each value from the `marks` list in sequence.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, the variable `marks` must be iterable, meaning it must be a collection (list, tuple, etc.) that can be iterated over.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is an index less than `n`.
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` is a list containing both `x` and `y`.

4. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is an index less than `n`, this means `n` should be at least 1 for the loop to start iterating over `marks`.
   - `marks` must be a non-empty list or collection to allow the loop to execute.
   - The initial values of `need_x` and `need_y` being `False` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute.

Therefore, the key adjustments needed are ensuring that `n` is greater than 0 and `marks` is a non-empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`**
