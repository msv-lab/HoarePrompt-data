The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. The values of these variables are determined by the input, and no specific values are provided initially. The precondition states that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l. After executing the code, these conditions will be respected, and the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` will be set based on the input.

Output State: **2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers**
