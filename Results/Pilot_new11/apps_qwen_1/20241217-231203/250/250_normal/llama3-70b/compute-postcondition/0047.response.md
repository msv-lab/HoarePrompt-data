The code sets `need_y` to `True`. This does not affect the value of `i`, `n`, `need_x`, or the condition involving `marks`. Therefore, the only change is that `need_y` is explicitly set to `True`.

Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `need_x` and `need_y` are `True`.**
