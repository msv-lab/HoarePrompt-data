Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i`.
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` is not empty.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in additional_marks:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `additional_marks` is not empty.
   - For each `j` in `additional_marks`, the loop body is executed.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is taken from `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` will lose one element after each iteration.
   - Therefore, `additional_marks` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` remains the same (it was the next element in the `marks` list at the start of the previous iteration).
   - `n` remains the same (it must be greater than 0).
   - `marks` remains the same (it is a non-empty list without the current `i`).
   - `need_x` remains `False`.
   - `need_y` remains `False`.
   - `additional_marks` must now be a non-empty list (since it must still contain at least one element).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` must be a non-empty list**.
