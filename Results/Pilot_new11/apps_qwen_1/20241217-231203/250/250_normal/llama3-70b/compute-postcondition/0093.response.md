Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop is iterating over `j` in `additional_marks`.

2. **Determine the Initial State for the Loop**: 
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `marks` is a non-empty list minus the current `i`.
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks` for any `j` in `additional_marks` minus the current `i`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `additional_marks` is the key collection for the loop, we need to ensure that `additional_marks` is not empty.
   - The initial values of `i`, `n`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute. However, they should remain as given unless specifically required to change within the context of the loop execution.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `additional_marks` is not empty.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list minus the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is not empty**
