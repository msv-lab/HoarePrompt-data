`need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` does not affect this assignment since there is no conditional check on this line. The previous values of the variables `i`, `n`, `marks[j] - marks[i]`, and `need_x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, and `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`. `need_x` is set to True, `need_y` is set to True.**
