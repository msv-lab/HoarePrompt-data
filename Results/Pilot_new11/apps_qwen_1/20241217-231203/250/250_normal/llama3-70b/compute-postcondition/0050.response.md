The code assigns the value `True` to `need_x`, which was already `True` initially. Therefore, the value of `need_x` remains unchanged, and `need_y` is still `True`. The output state does not change from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, and `n` is greater than `i`; `need_x` is `True`; `need_y` is `True`.**
