The line `need_y = True` sets the variable `need_y` to `True`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`.

Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`**
