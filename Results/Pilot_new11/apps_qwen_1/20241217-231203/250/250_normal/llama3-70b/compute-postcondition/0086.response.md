`additional_marks` is appended with the value of `i + j`. The value of `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, and `j` is an undefined variable, but since it's added to `i`, the new value in `additional_marks` will be `i + j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` contains at least one element and now includes `i + j`.
