The variable `need_y` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables such as `i`, `need_x`, or `j`. The condition that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `j` satisfies the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.**
