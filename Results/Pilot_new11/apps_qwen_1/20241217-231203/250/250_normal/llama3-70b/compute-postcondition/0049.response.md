Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is a valid index less than `n`.
   - `n` is greater than `i`.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` are both `True`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`, i.e., `for j in range(i, n)`.

3. **Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - If there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, then the conditions (`need_x` and `need_y`) remain unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` remains the same as it did not change in the loop (since the loop variable `j` iterates through values but does not affect `i`).
   - `n` remains the same as it did not change in the loop.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` may or may not remain `True`, depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should still be a valid index less than `n`.
   - `n` should still be greater than `i`.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` should still be `True`.

Given the above points, we can conclude:

- `i` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `need_x` and `need_y` must both be `True`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, and `n` is greater than `i`. `need_x` and `need_y` are `True`.**
