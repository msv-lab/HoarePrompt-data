Postcondition: ***`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `need_x` and `need_y` are `True`. If there exists an index `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, then `need_x` and `need_y` remain `True`. Otherwise, `need_x` and `need_y` remain `True`. The condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is met for some index `j`.***
