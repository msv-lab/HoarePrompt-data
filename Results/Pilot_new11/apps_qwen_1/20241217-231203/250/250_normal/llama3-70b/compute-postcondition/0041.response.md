According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`. Therefore, `need_x` and `need_y` will remain `True` unless they are modified within the loop body, but since we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume they remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n-1`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`**
