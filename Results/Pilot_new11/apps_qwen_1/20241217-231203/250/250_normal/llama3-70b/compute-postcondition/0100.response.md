Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i`.
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` is the original list with the appended value `i + j` if `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

3. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` remains the same as it is the next element in the `marks` list.
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `marks` will remain the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` will remain the same as they do not change within the loop.
   - `additional_marks` might change based on the loop condition `i + j <= l and i + j not in marks`.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have elements left to iterate over.

5. **Final States:**
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list (remains the same).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (remains the same).
   - `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i` (remains the same).
   - `need_x` is `False` (remains the same).
   - `need_y` is `False` (remains the same).
   - `additional_marks` must have at least one element left to iterate over (i.e., it is not empty).

**State:**
**`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` must have at least one element left to iterate over.**
