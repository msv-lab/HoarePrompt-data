Postcondition: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is the original list with the appended value `i + j` if `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`. If the condition `i + j <= l and i + j not in marks` is false, the list `additional_marks` remains unchanged.**
