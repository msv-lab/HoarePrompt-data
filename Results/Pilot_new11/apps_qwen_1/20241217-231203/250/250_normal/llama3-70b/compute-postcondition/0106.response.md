The code `print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))` does the following:

1. It maps each element in `additional_marks` to a string using `map(str, additional_marks)`.
2. It joins these string representations into a single string with spaces in between using `' '.join(...)`.
3. It prints this resulting string.

However, the code itself does not change any of the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `marks`, `need_x`, `need_y`, or `additional_marks`. It only prints the elements of `additional_marks`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the printing action, which does not affect the variable values but produces an output.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `marks` is a list that initially contains unique elements and may be modified by appending new elements during the loop, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks` for any `j` in `additional_marks`. The length of `additional_marks` is printed.**
