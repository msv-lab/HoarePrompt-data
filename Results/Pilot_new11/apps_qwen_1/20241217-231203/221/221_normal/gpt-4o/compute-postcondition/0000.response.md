The code assigns the value of `b ^ x` (bitwise XOR operation) to `a`. Since the initial values of `s` and `x` are not used in this operation, they remain unchanged. The variable `a` is newly introduced and assigned the result of `b ^ x`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-negative integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12, `a` is the result of `b ^ x`**
