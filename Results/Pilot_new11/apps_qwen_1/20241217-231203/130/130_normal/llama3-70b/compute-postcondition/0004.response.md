The code prints `-1`. Since this is a print statement, it does not assign any new values to the variables but instead outputs `-1`. The variables $N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$ remain unchanged.

Output State: **$N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$ are integers such that $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$, $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$, and $M \times \text{minimum number of coins each friend can gift} \ge L$. Additionally, either $M < N - K + 1$ or $M < L$; printed value is -1.**
