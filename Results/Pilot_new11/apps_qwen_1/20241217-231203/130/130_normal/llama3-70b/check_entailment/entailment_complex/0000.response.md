Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Condition Check**: The program checks if \( M \ge N - K + 1 \) and \( M \ge L \). These conditions are necessary but not sufficient to ensure that the problem's requirements are met. Specifically, the program needs to check if the total number of unique coins gifted by all friends can satisfy the condition that at least \( L \) coins are new in Ivan's collection.

2. **Minimum Number of Coins Each Friend Can Gift**: The program prints `1` if both conditions are met, assuming that each friend can gift just one coin. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of coins that each friend can gift to satisfy the conditions. The current implementation does not account for the fact that the friends need to gift a certain number of coins such that the total number of unique coins gifted is at least \( L \).

3. **Calculation of Minimum Coins Each Friend Can Gift**: The program should calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure that at least \( L \) coins are new in Ivan's collection. This involves determining the total number of unique coins required and distributing them among the friends.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate the minimum number of unique coins required to be new in Ivan's collection, i.e., \( L \).
- Distribute these unique coins among the friends such that each friend gifts the minimum number of coins necessary to achieve this goal.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    # Total number of unique coins needed
    total_unique_coins_needed = N - K + L
    
    # If total_unique_coins_needed is more than the total coins M can give, it's impossible
    if total_unique_coins_needed > M * N:
        print(-1)
    else:
        # Calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift
        min_coins_each_friend = -(-total_unique_coins_needed // M)  # Ceiling division
        print(min_coins_each_friend)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Unique Coins Needed**: We calculate the total number of unique coins required to be new in Ivan's collection, which is \( N - K + L \).
- **Feasibility Check**: We check if the total number of unique coins needed is feasible given the constraints \( M \) and \( N \).
- **Minimum Coins Each Friend Needs**: We use ceiling division to find the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure that the total number of unique coins gifted is at least \( L \).

This approach ensures that the program meets the problem description by correctly calculating the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to satisfy all the conditions.
