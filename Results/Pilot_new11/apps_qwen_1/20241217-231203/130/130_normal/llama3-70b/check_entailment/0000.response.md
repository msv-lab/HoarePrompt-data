Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. 

- It checks if the total number of friends \(M\) is at least as large as the difference between the total number of different coins \(N\) and the number of coins Ivan already has \(K\), plus one additional coin to ensure at least \(L\) new coins. This ensures that all coins gifted are different.
- If this condition is met, it prints `1`, indicating that each friend needs to gift just one coin to satisfy the conditions.
- If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`.

This logic correctly handles all the described constraints and examples provided. For instance, in the given example inputs:
- For input `20 15 2 3`, the program correctly outputs `1` because 15 friends can each gift one different coin, making a total of 15 different coins, ensuring at least 3 are new.
- For input `10 11 2 4`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because there are only 10 different coins, and 11 friends cannot each gift a unique coin.

Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
