Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions specified in the problem description. The code reads the input values \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input and calculates the minimum number of coins (\(x\)) required for each friend to gift such that the total number of different coins gifted is at least \(L\) and all these coins are new to Ivan's collection. 

The calculation \( \text{min\_x} = \lceil \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \rceil \) ensures that the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift is computed correctly. If \(M \times \text{min\_x} \leq N - K\), then the program prints \(\text{min\_x}\); otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

The output hints match the logic implemented in the code, and the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
