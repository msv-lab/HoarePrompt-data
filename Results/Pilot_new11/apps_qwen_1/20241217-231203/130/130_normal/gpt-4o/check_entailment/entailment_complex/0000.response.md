Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. This satisfies the requirement of accepting four integers as input.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - The variables \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) are initialized with the input values, ensuring they meet the constraints \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq M, L \leq 10^{18}\).

3. **Calculation of Minimum Coins per Friend**:
   - The variable `min_x` is calculated as \((L + M - 1) // M\). This step ensures that the division is performed correctly, even when dealing with large numbers. The use of the floor division operator `//` ensures that the result is an integer.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if \(M \times \text{min\_x} \leq N - K\). This condition verifies whether the minimum number of coins each friend can gift, such that the total number of new coins is at least \(L\), is feasible within the constraints of the problem.

5. **Output**:
   - If the condition is satisfied, the program prints `min_x`. If not, it prints `-1`. This output directly corresponds to the problem statement, which requires printing the minimum number of coins or `-1` if it is not possible.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic ensures that all terms specified in the problem are met:
     - Each friend gifts the same number of coins (\(M \times \text{min\_x}\)).
     - All coins gifted are different.
     - At least \(L\) coins must be new in Ivan's collection.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all cases as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
