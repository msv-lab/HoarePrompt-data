The given code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to the method `sys.stdin.read`. This method reads the entire input from standard input (usually the console) as a single string. However, this operation does not affect the values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`.

Therefore, the only change is that the `input` function is now using `sys.stdin.read` instead of the default behavior.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers such that 1 ≤ `K` ≤ `N` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `M`, `L` ≤ 10^18, and `M` * (`N` - `K`) ≥ `L`; `input` function is now `sys.stdin.read`**
