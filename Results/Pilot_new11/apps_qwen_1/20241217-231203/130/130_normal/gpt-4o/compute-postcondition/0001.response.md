The code reads four integers from the input using the `map` function and assigns them to `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are updated based on the input, but their relationships (such as `1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18` and `1 ≤ M`, `L` ≤ 10^18) and the condition `M * (N - K) ≥ L` still hold. The original preconditions and relationships are preserved, but the exact numerical values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are now dependent on the input.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are integers such that 1 ≤ `K` ≤ `N` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `M`, `L` ≤ 10^18, and `M` * (`N` - `K`) ≥ `L`; the values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are updated based on the input.**
