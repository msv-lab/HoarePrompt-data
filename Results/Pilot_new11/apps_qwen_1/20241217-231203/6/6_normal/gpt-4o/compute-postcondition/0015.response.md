Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. If `l == 1`, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. Otherwise, if `r == n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `r != n`, the output is the minimum of `abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2)` and `abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2)`.***
