The code assigns the value of `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))` to the variable `close_both_sides`. This means `close_both_sides` is calculated based on the values of `move_to_l`, `move_to_r`, `l`, and `r`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`
- `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`
- `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`
- `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `(r != n)`

The calculation for `close_both_sides` involves adding `(r - l + 2)` to both `move_to_l` and `move_to_r`. Since `move_to_l` and `move_to_r` are the absolute differences between `pos` and `l`, and `pos` and `r` respectively, the value of `close_both_sides` is determined by the minimum of these two adjusted values.

The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, `move_to_l`, and `move_to_r` are not explicitly stated in terms of their exact values, so we keep them as they are. However, we know the expressions for `move_to_l` and `move_to_r`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `(r != n)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `close_both_sides` is `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))**
