The code `n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())` takes four integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, these constraints will be maintained after the input is taken.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are the integers inputted by the user.**
