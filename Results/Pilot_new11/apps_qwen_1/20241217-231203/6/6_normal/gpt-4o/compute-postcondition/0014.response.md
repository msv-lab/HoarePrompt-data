Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. If `r == n`, the printed value is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `(r != n)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, and the printed value is `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`.***
