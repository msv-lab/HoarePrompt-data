The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The constraints are as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.

The function has two possible return cases:
- Case_1: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, and `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. If `pos` is equal to `l` or `r`, the function returns `True`.
- Case_2: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, and `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. If `pos` is not equal to `l` or `r`, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, and return `True` if `pos` is equal to `l` or `r`, otherwise it returns `False`.
