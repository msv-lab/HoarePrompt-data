Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
   - `pos` is an integer such that \(1 \leq pos \leq n\)
   - `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq n\)
   - `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\)
   - `ans` is `pos - r` if `pos` is greater than `r`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
   ```

3. Let's analyze the operations within the code snippet:
   - `min(pos - 1, n - r)` will take the minimum value between `pos - 1` and `n - r`.
     - If `pos - 1` is less than or equal to `n - r`, then `min(pos - 1, n - r) = pos - 1`.
     - If `pos - 1` is greater than `n - r`, then `min(pos - 1, n - r) = n - r`.
   - `max(0, l - 1)` will take the maximum value between 0 and `l - 1`.
     - If `l - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `max(0, l - 1) = l - 1`.
     - If `l - 1` is less than 0, then `max(0, l - 1) = 0`.

4. The operation `ans += ...` means that `ans` is updated by adding the results of the two expressions.

5. Given the initial conditions, let's consider the different cases:
   - If `pos > r`, then `ans = pos - r`.
   - If `pos <= r`, then `ans = 0`.

Since `ans` is already defined in terms of `pos` and `r`, and the addition is being performed based on the values of `pos`, `r`, `n`, and `l`, we need to account for the changes made by the code snippet.

The updated value of `ans` will be:
\[ \text{ans} = (pos - r) + \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1) \]

Given the constraints, the final state of the variables is:
- `n` remains in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `pos` remains in the range \(1 \leq pos \leq n\)
- `l` remains in the range \(1 \leq l \leq n\)
- `r` remains in the range \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\)
- `ans` is updated as described above.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `pos` is an integer such that \(1 \leq pos \leq n\); `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq n\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\); `ans` is \((pos - r) + \min(pos - 1, n - r) + \max(0, l - 1)\).**
