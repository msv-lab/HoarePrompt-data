The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n; `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is 0**
