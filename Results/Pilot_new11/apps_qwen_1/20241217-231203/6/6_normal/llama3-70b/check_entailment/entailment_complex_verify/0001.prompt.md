You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the optimal strategy when the cursor is already within the desired segment [l, r]. Let's consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
5 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5
```

In this case, the cursor is already at position 3, which is within the segment [2, 4]. The optimal solution would be to close all tabs to the left of the cursor (positions 1 and 2), which can be done in 2 seconds. However, the provided program calculates the moves as follows:
- It takes 1 second to move the cursor to position 2.
- It takes 1 second to close all tabs to the left of the cursor.
- It takes 1 second to move the cursor to position 4.
- It takes 1 second to close all tabs to the right of the cursor.

This results in a total of 5 seconds, which is incorrect. The correct solution should be 2 seconds. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this input.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, pos is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, and l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if (pos < l) :
        ans += l - pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n; `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ n; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is `l - pos` if `pos < l`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
    if (pos > r) :
        ans += pos - r
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n; `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ n; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is `pos - r` if `pos` is greater than `r`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. It processes these parameters according to specific conditions and calculates a value stored in `ans`. After executing the necessary conditions, it prints the value of `ans`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` contains a value determined by the following logic:
- If `pos` is less than `l`, `ans` is incremented by `l - pos`.
- If `pos` is greater than `r`, `ans` is incremented by `pos - r`.
- Finally, `ans` is adjusted by adding `min(pos - 1, n - r)` and `max(0, l - 1)`.

The function does not return a boolean value as suggested in the original annotation. Instead, it prints the computed value of `ans`. The function covers all potential edge cases where `pos` is within the range `[l, r]`, exactly at `l` or `r`, or outside this range.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
