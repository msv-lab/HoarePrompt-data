The code assigns the value of `x ** z ** y` to `a2`. Since the initial state only mentions `a1` being `x`, and does not specify values for `x`, `z`, and `y`, the calculation for `a2` depends on these unspecified values. Therefore, the updated state includes `a2` being `x ** z ** y`.

Output State: **`a1` is x, `a2` is x ** z ** y**
