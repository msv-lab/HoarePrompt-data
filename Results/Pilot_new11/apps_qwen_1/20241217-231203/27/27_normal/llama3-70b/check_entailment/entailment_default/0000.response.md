Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the order of operations in the exponential expressions is ambiguous due to the lack of parentheses. According to the mathematical rules, expressions like \(x^{y^z}\) and \((x^y)^z\) are evaluated differently. The program calculates all possible variations without considering the proper order of operations, which leads to incorrect results in some cases.

For example, consider the input `1.1 3.4 2.5`:
- \(1.1^{3.4^{2.5}}\) is calculated as \(1.1^{(3.4^{2.5})}\)
- \((1.1^{3.4})^{2.5}\) is calculated as \(((1.1^{3.4})^{2.5})\)

These two expressions can yield very different results, and the program does not account for this difference. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
