Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to evaluate all twelve possible expressions and determine the one with the maximum value. Given the constraints and the specific format required for outputting the expressions, the program handles all potential cases appropriately. Since the program processes all inputs as described and outputs the correct expression for the maximum value, it meets the problem requirements in all scenarios.
