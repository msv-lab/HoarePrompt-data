The code `x, y, z = map(float, input().split())` reads three space-separated floating-point numbers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the input values replace the existing values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, the previous values are no longer valid. The Output State will include the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` which are the input values.

Output State: **`x` is the first input float, `y` is the second input float, `z` is the third input float**
