The code `print(max_expr)` simply prints the content of `max_expr` which is a tuple containing the maximum value and its corresponding expression. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. The `max_value` and `max_expr` are determined before this line of code is executed. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the preconditions.

Output State: **`x` is the first input float, `y` is the second input float, `z` is the third input float, `max_value` is the maximum value among the results of the expressions in the `expressions` list, `max_expr` is the tuple containing the maximum value and its corresponding expression.**
