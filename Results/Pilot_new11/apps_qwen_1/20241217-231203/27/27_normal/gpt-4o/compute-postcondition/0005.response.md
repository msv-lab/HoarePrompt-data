The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the definition `def func_1():`. The output is not specified directly in the given information but rather through the constraints provided.

Given the constraints:
- `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point.
- The range for `x`, `y`, and `z` is from 0.1 to 200.0.

Since the function does not accept parameters, we need to focus on the return value based on the constraints provided. However, the output itself is not defined in the problem statement, so we can only describe the constraints on the variables.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
