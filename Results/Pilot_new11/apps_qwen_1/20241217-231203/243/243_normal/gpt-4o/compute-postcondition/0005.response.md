The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(mid)` to the variable `zeroes`. Here, `mid` is calculated as \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\). However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so its exact behavior is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\)

After executing `zeroes = func_1(mid)`, the following is true:
- `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid)`
- `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, and `mid` remain unchanged

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
