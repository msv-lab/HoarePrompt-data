Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, and `left` must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`. Each iteration of the loop decreases `left` by 1.
2. **Final Value of `left`**: After the loop terminates, `left` will be equal to `low - 1` because the loop subtracts 1 from `left` in each iteration.
3. **Condition for Termination**: For the loop to execute at least one time, `func_1(mid)` must initially be equal to `m`. As the loop continues, `left` keeps decreasing until it either no longer satisfies `func_1(left) == m` or the loop reaches the lower bound defined by `low`.

Thus, after the loop has executed, `left` will be `low - 1`, and it must satisfy `func_1(left) == m` for the loop to have executed at least one iteration. If `func_1(left) != m`, the loop would not have executed at all, and `left` would still be `mid`.

This state captures the necessary conditions and final values of the relevant variables after the loop has completed its execution.
