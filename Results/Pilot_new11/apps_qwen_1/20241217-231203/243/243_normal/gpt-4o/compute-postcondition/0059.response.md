To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop and how the loop variables change during each iteration.

The loop condition is `low <= high`.

Let's break down the conditions given:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
   - `zeroes` is calculated based on `m`.
   - `low` and `high` are defined based on `zeroes` and `m`:
     - If `zeroes < m`, then `low = 7 * m + 3` and `high = 5 * m + 1`.
     - If `zeroes > m`, then `low = ((5 * m + 1) // 2) + 1` and `high = 7 * m + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `low` must be strictly less than or equal to `high`. If `low` becomes greater than `high`, the loop will terminate.

Since the loop is a `while True` loop or a definite loop where the condition is guaranteed to hold true until the termination condition (`low > high`), we do not need to adjust any state beyond ensuring the loop condition remains true.

Given that the only way to exit the loop is when `low` exceeds `high`, the only state we need to ensure for the loop to continue is that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Thus, no other state needs to be adjusted beyond maintaining the loop condition.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`**
