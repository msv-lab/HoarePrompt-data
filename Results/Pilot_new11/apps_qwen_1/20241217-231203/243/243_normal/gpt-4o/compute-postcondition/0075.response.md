The value of `right` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `mid + 1` to `mid + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `low` is less than or equal to `high`
- `left` is `low - 1`
- `right` is now `mid + 2`
- `func_1(left) == m`

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + 2`, and `func_1(left) == m`**
