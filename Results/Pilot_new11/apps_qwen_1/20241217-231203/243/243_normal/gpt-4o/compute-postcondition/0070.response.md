Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `left` is `mid - 2`.
   - `left` must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must still hold true.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that the value of `left` and the function result `func_1(left)` remain such that the loop condition is met.

- Since `left` is defined as `mid - 2`, and the condition `func_1(left) == m` must still hold, we don't need to change `left` or `func_1(left)`.
- However, since the loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`, we must ensure that `left` remains in a state where `func_1(left) == m` is true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `left` remains such that `func_1(left) == m` holds true for the next iteration. But since the exact value of `left` and the result of `func_1(left)` are not provided, we can't specify an exact numerical adjustment.

However, based on the given information and the need for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `left` remains valid for the next iteration. This means that `left` should be consistent with the previous state where `func_1(left) == m`.

State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `mid - 2`, and `left` must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`**
