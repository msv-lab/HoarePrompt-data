Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **Loop Condition**: `while func_1(right) == m`
- **Initial States Before Loop**:
  - `low` is less than or equal to `high`
  - `left` is `low - 1`
  - `right` is `mid + 1`
  - `func_1(left) == m`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high`: This condition is given and does not need adjustment for the loop to continue.
   - `left` is `low - 1`: This is a constant and does not change within the loop.
   - `right` is `mid + 1`: This is another constant and does not change within the loop.
   - `func_1(left) == m`: This is a constant condition and does not change within the loop.

3. **Requirement for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The loop condition is solely dependent on `func_1(right) == m`.
   - Since `right` is defined as `mid + 1`, and no operations are performed inside the loop that would change `right`, the only way to satisfy the condition is to ensure that `func_1(right)` returns `m` initially.

### Conclusion:
- There are no changes needed in the given states to ensure the loop executes at least once because the initial conditions already meet the requirement for the loop to continue.

### Final Answer:
State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + 1`, and `func_1(left) == m`**
