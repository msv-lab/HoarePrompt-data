`left` is decremented by 1. The value of `left` was originally `mid - 1` and must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`. After decrementing, `left` becomes `(mid - 1) - 1` which simplifies to `mid - 2`. The conditions and relations involving `func_1(left)` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `mid - 2`, and `left` must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`**
