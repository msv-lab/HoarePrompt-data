Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`
- `zeroes` is less than `m`
- `left` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\)

### Loop Condition and Execution
The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`. Each iteration of the loop decrements `left` by 1.

#### After 1 iteration:
- `left` becomes \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1\)

#### After 2 iterations:
- `left` becomes \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 2\)

#### After 3 iterations:
- `left` becomes \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 3\)
- This suggests that with each iteration, `left` is decremented by 1.

### General Pattern
Given that the loop decrements `left` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`, we can deduce that the loop will terminate when `func_1(left) != m`.

Since `func_1(mid)` is less than `m`, and `left` starts at \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\) and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue to decrement `left` until `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`.

### Final State Analysis
- `m` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `m`.
- `low` remains 0 as the loop does not modify `low`.
- `high` remains \(5 \times m + 1\) as the loop does not modify `high`.
- `result` remains an empty list as the loop does not modify `result`.
- `mid` remains \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\) as the loop does not modify `mid`.
- `zeroes` remains the value returned by `func_1(mid)` as the loop does not modify `zeroes`.
- `left` will be the value just before `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`.

Thus, the final state of the loop is:
- `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`.

### Output State
Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m**.
