The code decrements the value of `left` by 1. Initially, `left` is `mid - 2`. After the decrement, `left` becomes `(mid - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `mid - 3`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `mid - 3`, and `left` must satisfy the condition `func_1(left) == m`**
