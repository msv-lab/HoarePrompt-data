Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the provided program state step by step.

### Given:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\).
- `result` is an empty list.
- `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\).
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.
- `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`.
- `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 3\).
- `func_1(right)` must return `m`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while func_1(right) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_1(right)` returns `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` still returns `m` at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 3\).
- `func_1(right)` must return `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `right` must still be valid and `func_1(right)` must still return `m`. Therefore, `right` must remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed to the existing states because the only requirement is that `func_1(right)` returns `m`, and this is already ensured by the given conditions. The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `left`, and `right` do not need to be modified for the loop to continue.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, `right` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 + 3\), and `func_1(right)` must return `m`.**
