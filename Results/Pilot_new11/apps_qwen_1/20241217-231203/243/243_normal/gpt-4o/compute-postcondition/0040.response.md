Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\).
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\).
- `result` is an empty list.
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`.
- `mid` is \((7 \times m + 2)\).
- `left` is \((7 \times m + 2)\).

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```python
while func_1(left) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must be true when the loop starts.

### Current State:
- `left` is set to \((7 \times m + 2)\).
- The value of `func_1(left)` is stored in `zeroes`.

### Required Condition:
To make the loop execute at least once, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must hold true initially.

### Checking the Current State:
- We know `left = (7 * m + 2)`.
- We need to check if `func_1(left)` returns `m`.

Given that `zeroes = func_1(left)`, we need to ensure that `zeroes == m` initially.

### Conclusion:
No changes are needed in the given states because the condition `func_1(left) == m` should already be satisfied based on the initial setup provided.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \((7 \times m + 2)\), `left` is \((7 \times m + 2)\)**.
