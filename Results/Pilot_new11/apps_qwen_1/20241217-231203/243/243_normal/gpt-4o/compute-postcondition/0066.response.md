Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2.
   - `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `left` is equal to `mid`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must be true initially.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `left` is equal to `mid`, we need to check the value of `func_1(mid)`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(mid)` must equal `m`.
   - Given that `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, we need to ensure that `zeroes` equals `m`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - We need to adjust the state such that `zeroes` (which is `func_1(mid)`) is equal to `m`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `zeroes` is equal to `m`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `mid`**
