The code updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `7 * m + 2`, we can substitute this into the equation to find the new value of `low`.

1. Previous value of `low`: \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\)
2. Previous value of `mid`: \(7 \times m + 2\)
3. New value of `low`: \(mid + 1 = (7 \times m + 2) + 1 = 7 \times m + 3\)

The other variables (`high`, `result`, `zeroes`, and `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is \(7 \times m + 3\); `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\); `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`; `mid` is \(7 \times m + 2\)**
