The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `m`, `func_1(right)`, `right`, and `result`. It simply breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since no variables are updated or reassigned within this code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `func_1(right)` is equal to `m` and `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right) == m` and all values between `right - 1` and `right` do not satisfy `func_1(x) == m`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
