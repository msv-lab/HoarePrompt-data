Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). If `zeroes < m`, then `low` is \(7 \times m + 3\) and `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\). Otherwise, if `zeroes > m`, then `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\) and `high` is \(7 \times m + 1\). Additionally, `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`. If `zeroes == m`, then `func_1(right)` equals `m` and `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right) == m` and all values between `right - 1` and `right` do not satisfy `func_1(x) == m`. Furthermore, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
