`right` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `mid + 3` to `mid + 4`. The other variables (`low`, `high`, `left`, and `func_1(mid + 3)`) remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + 4`, and `func_1(mid + 3) == m`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + 4`, and `func_1(mid + 3) == m**
