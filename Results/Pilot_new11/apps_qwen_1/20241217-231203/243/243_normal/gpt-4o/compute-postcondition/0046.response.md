Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \(7 \times m + 2\), `left` is \(7 \times m - k\)** where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed. If the loop does not execute, `left` remains \((7 \times m + 2)\).
