To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
- The loop condition is `low <= high`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `low = 0`.
   - `high = 5 \times (m + 1)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

3. **Determining When the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute at least one more time, the condition `low <= high` must be true.
   - Initially, `low` is 0 and `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
   - Since \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), the smallest possible value for `high` is \(5 \times (1 + 1) = 10\) and the largest possible value is \(5 \times (100,000 + 1) = 500,005\).

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - Since `low` starts at 0, the only way to ensure the loop executes is to make sure `high` is greater than 0.
   - Given that `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), and \(m\) is an integer between 1 and 100,000, the minimum value of `high` is 10, which is always greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
Since the minimum value of `high` is 10, which is greater than 0, the initial values already ensure that the loop can execute at least one more time. No further adjustments to the states are necessary.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is 5 \(\times\) (`m` + 1); `result` is an empty list**
