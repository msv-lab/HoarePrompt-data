`right` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `func_1(right) == m`. After incrementing `right` by 1, the new value of `right` will be `right + 1`, and this new value satisfies the condition `func_1(right + 1) == m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `right` is such that `func_1(right + 1) == m`**
