The code `zeroes = func_1(mid)` assigns the result of `func_1(mid)` to the variable `zeroes`. The variables `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the only new information introduced is the assignment of the value returned by `func_1(mid)` to `zeroes`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
