Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). `low` is either \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\) or \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1)\). `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\). `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, and `right` is \(5 \times m + 1\). `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` where `mid = (5 \times m + 1) // 2`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\); otherwise, `low` is set to \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1)\) and `high` is set to \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1)\). If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the program variables after executing the if-else block, considering both the if and else conditions.
