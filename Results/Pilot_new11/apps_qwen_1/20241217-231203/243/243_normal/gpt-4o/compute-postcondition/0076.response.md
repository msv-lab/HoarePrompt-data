Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `left` is `low - 1`.
- `right` is `mid + 2`.
- `func_1(left) == m`.

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.

### Analysis
To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition `func_1(right) == m`.

Given:
- `right` is defined as `mid + 2`.
- We need `func_1(right)` to be equal to `m` for the loop to continue.

Since no specific values for `mid` or `m` are given, we only know that `right = mid + 2`. The function `func_1` needs to return `m` for the loop to continue.

### State Adjustments Needed
The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time is the condition `func_1(right) == m`. 

Given `right = mid + 2`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid + 2) == m` for the loop to continue.

### Final State
State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + 2`, and `func_1(mid + 2) == m`**
