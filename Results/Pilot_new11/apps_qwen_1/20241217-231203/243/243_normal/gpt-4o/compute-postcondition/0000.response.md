The given code snippet is a comment block and does not contain any executable statements. Therefore, no changes will be made to the variables or their values. The only information that remains from the initial state is that `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)**
