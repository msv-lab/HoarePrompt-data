The code updates the variable `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high`. Given the initial state:

- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\)
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` where `mid = (5 \times m + 1) // 2`

After executing `mid = (low + high) // 2`, the variable `mid` is updated to this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` where `mid = (5 \times m + 1) // 2`, `mid` is \(((low + high) // 2)\)**
