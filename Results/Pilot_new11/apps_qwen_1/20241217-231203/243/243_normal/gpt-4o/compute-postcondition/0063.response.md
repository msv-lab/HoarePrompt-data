`high` is reassigned the value of `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is initially defined as (`low` + `high`) // 2, the new value of `high` becomes (`low` + (`low` + `high`) // 2) - 1. The value of `zeroes` remains unchanged as it is the result of `func_1(mid)`, which was computed before the reassignment of `high`. The values of `low` and `mid` remain the same as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `high` is (`low` + (`low` + `high`) // 2) - 1.**
