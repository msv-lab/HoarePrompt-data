Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no values of \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes correctly. Specifically, in `func_2`, if the binary search process does not find any \( n \) that satisfies the condition, the function returns an empty list instead of indicating that no such \( n \) exists. This is evident in the second example provided:

- For \( m = 5 \), the output should be `0` because there are no positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 trailing zeroes. However, the program will return an empty list, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program should return `0` when no such \( n \) is found, rather than returning an empty list. Here's how you could modify `func_2` to handle this correctly:

```python
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    if not result:
        return 0
    return len(result), result
```

With this modification, the program correctly handles the case where no such \( n \) exists and returns `0` as required.
