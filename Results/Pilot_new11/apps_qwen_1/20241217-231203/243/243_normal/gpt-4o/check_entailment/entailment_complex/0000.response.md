Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case when `m` is 0. According to the problem description, we need to find the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. When `m` is 0, the factorial of `n` should end with 0 zeroes, which means `n` must be less than 5 (since `4! = 24` has 0 trailing zeroes and `5! = 120` has 1 trailing zero).

However, the provided code does not account for this scenario properly. Specifically, the `func_2` function performs a binary search to find the range of `n` values for which `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. For `m = 0`, the binary search will fail to find the correct range because it is looking for a specific `mid` value where `func_1(mid) == m`, and it does not handle the case where `m` is 0 correctly.

To illustrate, let's consider the input `m = 0`:
- The binary search will start with `low = 0` and `high = 250000` (an upper bound).
- The loop will run but will not find any value where `func_1(mid) == 0` because `func_1(mid)` will always be greater than 0 for `mid > 0`.
- As a result, the loop will continue until `low` exceeds `high`, and `result` will remain an empty list.

Therefore, the code does not correctly handle the case when `m = 0`, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
