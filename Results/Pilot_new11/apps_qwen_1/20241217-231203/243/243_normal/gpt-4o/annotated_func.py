    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is the total sum of `n // (original_power_of_5 * 5^k)` for each iteration where `k` ranges from 0 to the number of iterations, `n` is unchanged, `power_of_5` is `original_power_of_5 * 5^k` for the last iteration where `n >= original_power_of_5 * 5^k`, and `n` must be less than `original_power_of_5 * 5^(k+1)` for the last iteration.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total sum of n // (original_power_of_5 * 5^k) for each iteration where k ranges from 0 to the number of iterations, with n being less than original_power_of_5 * 5^(k+1) for the last iteration
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of trailing zeroes in `n!`. It does this by iteratively calculating the sum of `n // (5^k)` for each power of 5 until `n < 5^(k+1)`. The function starts with `power_of_5` set to 5 and increases it by multiplying by 5 in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `power_of_5`. After the loop completes, the function returns the accumulated count. This count represents the total number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to `n`, which directly corresponds to the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case when `n` is 0, as `0! = 1`, which has 0 trailing zeroes. In this case, the function will return 0 immediately without entering the loop.
- The function also correctly handles the case when `n` is 1, as `1! = 1`, which also has 0 trailing zeroes. In this case, the function will return 0 immediately without entering the loop.
- The function correctly handles large values of `n` by iteratively dividing `n` by increasing powers of 5 and summing up the results. There are no missing functionalities related to handling large inputs.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). `low` is the final value determined by the binary search process, and `high` is also the final value determined by the same process. `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, and `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right) == m` and all values between `right - 1` and `right` do not satisfy `func_1(x) == m`. `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` where `mid` is the midpoint of `low` and `high` at the end of the loop. If `zeroes` is equal to `m`, the loop terminates, and `result` is set to the range of values from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. If `zeroes` does not equal `m`, the loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, and `result` remains an empty list.
    return result
    #`The program returns an empty list because low exceeds high, and no values in the specified range satisfy func_1(x) == m`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and uses a binary search approach to find a range of integers `n` for which `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It initializes `low` and `high` to search within a predefined range and iteratively narrows down the search space. If it finds a value `mid` such that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`, it then expands the search to find the exact range of numbers that satisfy the condition. If `low` exceeds `high` without finding such a range, it returns an empty list. The function ultimately returns either a range of integers satisfying the condition or an empty list if no such range is found.
