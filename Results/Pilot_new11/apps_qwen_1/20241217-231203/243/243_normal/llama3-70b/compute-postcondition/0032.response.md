Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000, `count` is the largest integer such that \(5^{\text{count}}\) is less than or equal to `m`, `n` is the original value of `n` plus 1, and `ans` is a list containing `[1, n]`. If `n // 5 ** count < m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
