Output State: **`m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000; `count` is the largest integer such that \(5^{\text{count}} \leq m\); `n` is `n + k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop executed; `ans` is a list containing `[1, 2, ..., n]` if the final value of `n` is less than 5, otherwise `ans` is unchanged.**
