`count` is incremented by 1 if the condition `n // 5` evaluates to a non-zero value. Since `n` is initially 1, the expression `n // 5` evaluates to 0 (which is equivalent to False), so the condition is not met and `count` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000, `count` is 0, and `n` is 1**
