`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr_beauty` was 0, so now it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `'left' is equal to the length of 's', 'right' is 2, 's' is a string where 's[0]' is 'S', 's[1]' is not 'G', and 's[2]' is 'G', 'max_beauty' is the maximum of its current value and 0, 'curr_beauty' is 1, and the condition 'left < right' is true.
