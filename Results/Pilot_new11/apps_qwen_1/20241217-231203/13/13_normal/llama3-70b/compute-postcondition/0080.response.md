Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is within the valid range (4 to n-1).
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` must contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1).
   - `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 2` to `n`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `j` is within the valid range (4 to n-1).
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` must contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1).
   - `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it remains unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be in the range `(i + 2, n)`.
   - Since `i` is 2, the new range for `j` will be `(2 + 2, n)` or `(4, n)`.

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `j` must be in the range (4, n).
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` must still contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1).
   - `beauty` will be incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G' and remains unchanged otherwise.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `j` must be in the range (4, n), `n` must be at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` must contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1), and `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise `beauty` remains unchanged.**
