Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step-by-step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over the string `s` in reverse order starting from `i-1` down to `0`. For each character `s[j]`:
- If `s[j]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop breaks, and `curr_beauty` remains the same.

### Initial State
- `left` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` or the length of `s` if no 'G' is found.
- `right` is the length of `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop.
- `curr_beauty` is 1.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `beauty` is 1 if `s[j]` is not 'G', otherwise `beauty` is 3.

### Iteration Observations
1. **After the first iteration (`j = 1`):**
   - If `s[1]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[1]` is 'S', `curr_beauty` remains 1.
   - `beauty` is 4 if `s[1]` is 'G' and `s[0]` is 'G', 3 if `s[1]` is 'G' and `s[0]` is 'S', 2 if `s[1]` is 'S' and `s[0]` is 'G', and 1 if `s[1]` is 'S' and `s[0]` is 'S'.

2. **After the second iteration (`j = 0`):**
   - If `s[0]` is 'G', `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[0]` is 'S', `curr_beauty` remains the same.
   - `beauty` is 5 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is 'G', 4 if `s[0]` is 'G' and `s[1]` is 'S', 3 if `s[0]` is 'S' and `s[1]` is 'G', and 2 if `s[0]` is 'S' and `s[1]` is 'S'.

### Final State After All Iterations
To determine the final state, we need to consider the maximum possible `curr_beauty` and the value of `beauty` based on the string `s`.

- If `s` contains consecutive 'G's, the loop will increment `curr_beauty` for each consecutive 'G'.
- `max_beauty` will store the maximum value of `curr_beauty` encountered during the loop.
- `beauty` will reflect the value of `curr_beauty` when the loop breaks, considering the conditions described above.

### Output State After the Loop Executes
The loop will execute for each valid `j` in the range from `i-1` to `-1`. After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be:
- `curr_beauty` will be the maximum number of consecutive 'G's found in the string `s` (this is stored in `max_beauty`).
- `beauty` will be the value of `curr_beauty` when the loop breaks, which can be either `1`, `3`, `4`, or `5` depending on the conditions described.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`curr_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's found in `s`, `beauty` is the value of `curr_beauty` when the loop breaks, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's found in `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is within the valid range (0 to n-1), `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `beauty` reflects the value of `curr_beauty` when the loop breaks.**
