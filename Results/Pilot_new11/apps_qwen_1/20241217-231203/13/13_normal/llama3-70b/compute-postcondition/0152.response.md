According to the given for loop statement, the loop iterates over the range starting from `i + 2` to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values are as follows:

- `i` is 4
- `j` is 6
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`
- `beauty` is either incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', or remains unchanged as the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be within the range defined by the for loop, which is from `i + 2` to `n`.

Given that `i` is 4, the smallest possible value for `j` in the next iteration would be `i + 2`, which is `4 + 2 = 6`. Since `j` is currently 6, it means the loop has already checked this value and possibly moved forward.

To proceed with the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `j` must be strictly greater than `i + 1`). Therefore, `j` will be 7 in the next iteration.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` remains 4
- `j` becomes 7
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` remains the same list of indices of 'G' in `s`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` remains the same
- `beauty` will be updated based on the condition: it is either incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', or remains unchanged as the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 7, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, and `beauty` is either incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', or remains unchanged as the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`.**
