The code snippet `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` updates the value of `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr_beauty`. However, the specific values of `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are not provided. The output state will include the updated value of `max_beauty`.

Since `curr_beauty` could be any value, and it is compared with `max_beauty` which is initially 0, `max_beauty` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`. If `curr_beauty` is greater than 0, `max_beauty` will be updated to `curr_beauty`; otherwise, it remains 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is unchanged, and the character at index `right` in `s` is not 'G'.**
