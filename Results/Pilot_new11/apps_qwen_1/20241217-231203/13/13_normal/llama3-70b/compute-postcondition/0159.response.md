Output State: **`max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's in `s` after swapping at most one 'S' with 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's in `s` without any swaps, `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` or the length of `s` if no 'G' is found, `right` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each possible position `i` in the string `s` (from `n-2` down to `0`). For each position `i` where `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i+1]` is 'S', it checks for the longest sequence of consecutive 'G's that can be formed by swapping the 'S' at `i+1` with 'G'.

2. **Inner Loop for Beauty Calculation**:
   - The inner loops count the number of consecutive 'G's to the left and right of `i` when `s[i+1]` is 'S'.
   - `beauty` is updated to the maximum number of consecutive 'G's that can be achieved by swapping `s[i+1]` with 'G'.

3. **Updating `max_beauty_one_swap`**:
   - After calculating `beauty` for each valid pair `(i, i+1)` where `s[i] == 'G'` and `s[i+1] == 'S'`, the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`, meaning the loop has checked every possible position in the string.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` will hold the maximum number of consecutive 'G's that can be achieved by swapping at most one 'S' with 'G'.
   - `max_beauty` will hold the maximum number of consecutive 'G's in the string without any swaps.
   - `golden` remains unchanged, containing all indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `left` and `right` retain their original values since they are not modified within the loop.
   - `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` will reflect the final state of the loop iteration.
