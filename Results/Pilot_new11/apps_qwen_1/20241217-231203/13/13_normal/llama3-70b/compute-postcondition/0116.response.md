The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, since there are no loops or if statements inside the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables and simply exits the context where it was placed.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is at least 6, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
