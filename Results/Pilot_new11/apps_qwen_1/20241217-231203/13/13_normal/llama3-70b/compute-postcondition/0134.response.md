The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is not specified, but it is being modified here. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition for `s` also remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 1, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
