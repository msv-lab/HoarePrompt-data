`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr_beauty` was 0, so now it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, the current value of `right` satisfies `s[right] == 'G'`.
