Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States Before the Loop:
- `left` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`
- `curr_beauty` is 0
- The character at index `right` in `s` is not 'G'

### Loop Condition:
```
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.
   - Initially, `left` is 0 and `s[left]` (which is `s[0]`) is not 'G'.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to proceed to the first iteration, `left` must be incremented to 1 (so that `left < right` holds true).
   - Additionally, the character at `left` (now `s[1]`) should still not be 'G'.

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `left` starts at 0, to make the first iteration possible, we need to increment `left` to 1.
   - We also need to ensure that `s[1]` is not 'G'.

4. **Other States**:
   - The condition `s[left] != 'G'` implies that `s[0]` was not 'G'. This doesn't change after the first iteration unless `left` changes.
   - `right` is not specified to change in this context, so we assume it remains the same for now.
   - The values of `n`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` don't need adjustment for the first iteration.

### Final Adjusted State:
The state needs to be adjusted such that `left` is 1 and `s[1]` is not 'G'. All other states remain the same.

State: **`left` is 1, `s[1]` is not 'G', `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0**

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`left` is 1, `s[1]` is not 'G', `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0**
