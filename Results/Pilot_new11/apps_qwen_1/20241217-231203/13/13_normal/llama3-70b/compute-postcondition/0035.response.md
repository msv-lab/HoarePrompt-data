The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. The initial value of `curr_beauty` is not specified in the initial state, so it could be any value, but after the code executes, it is increased by 1. The conditions and values of `left`, `right`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `s[0]` must be 'S', `s[1]` must not be 'G', `s[2]` must be 'G', `curr_beauty` is increased by 1**
