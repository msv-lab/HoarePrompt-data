`beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `s[j]` must be either 'G' or 'S', and the code does not specify which, the only certain change is that `beauty` increases by 1. The conditions for `j`, `n`, `s`, and `golden` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` must be in the range (4, n), `n` must be at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` must contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1), and `beauty` is incremented by 1.**
