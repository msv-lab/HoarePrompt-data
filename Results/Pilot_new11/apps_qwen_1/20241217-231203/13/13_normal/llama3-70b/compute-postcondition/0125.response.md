Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`.
   - `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's starting from `j` up to `i-2` inclusive, or 1 if no such sequence exists.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` should be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 4 (since it was 3 previously).

4. **Finding `j`:**
   - `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`.
   - Since `i` is now 4, we need to find the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after 4. This means we need to look at positions 6, 5, and so on, until we find a 'G'.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `beauty` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`.
- `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's starting from `j` up to `i-2` inclusive, or 1 if no such sequence exists.

State: **`max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`, `i` is 4, `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after 4, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, and `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's starting from `j` up to `i-2` inclusive, or 1 if no such sequence exists.**
