The code `break` is executed within a loop or conditional statement, which means it will exit the current loop or block without changing any variable values. The states of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is the largest index in `golden` that is less than or equal to 2, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`, and the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` must be valid, and `s[j] != 'G'` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
