Postcondition: **`left` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` or the length of `s` if no 'G' is found, `right` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is 1 (since `s[i] == 'G'`), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is 1 (since `i` starts at 0 and we just incremented it), `n` must be at least 2**
