`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` is now an integer obtained from user input. The second line containing a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S' remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the integer input by the user, and the second line contains a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, and the second line contains a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'.**
