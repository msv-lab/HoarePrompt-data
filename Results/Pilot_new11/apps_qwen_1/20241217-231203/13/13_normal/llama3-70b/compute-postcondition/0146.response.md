The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement specified, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 6, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found starting from `j` up to but not including `i`, and `s[j]` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
