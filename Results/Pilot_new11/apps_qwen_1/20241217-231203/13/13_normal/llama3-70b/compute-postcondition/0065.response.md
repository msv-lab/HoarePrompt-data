To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and the logic of the loop.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is 2
- `j` is within the valid range (0 to n-1)
- `n` must be at least 2
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'
- `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop
- `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it remains the same
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0
- `beauty` is 1 if `s[j]` is not 'G', otherwise `beauty` is 3

### Loop Information:
```
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values and Range**: 
   - The loop starts from `i - 1` which is `2 - 1 = 1` and goes until `-1` (exclusive).
   - This means `j` starts at 1 and goes down to 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was within the valid range (0 to n-1). Since the loop is decrementing `j` from `i-1` downwards, `j` must be 0 for the loop to stop.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as the loop variable is `j`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `beauty` remain unchanged because the problem does not specify that these values are modified inside the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 1.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it remains the same, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `beauty` is 1 if `s[j]` is not 'G', otherwise `beauty` is 3.**
