Let's analyze the loop and determine its output state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `left` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'
- `max_beauty` is 1
- `curr_beauty` is 0
- `right` is 2

### Loop Condition:
```python
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
    left += 1
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop continues as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.
- Each iteration increments `left` by 1 until either `left == right` or `s[left] == 'G'`.

### Output States After Some Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration:**
  - `left` is 1
  - `right` is 2
  - `s[0]` must be 'S'
  
- **After 2 iterations:**
  - `left` is 2
  - `right` is 2
  - `s[0]` must be 'S'
  - `s[1]` must not be 'G'
  
- **After 3 iterations:**
  - `left` is 3
  - `right` is 2
  - `s[0]` must be 'S'
  - `s[1]` must not be 'G'

### General Observation:
- The loop will continue as long as `left` is less than `right` and the character at `s[left]` is not 'G'.
- Once `left` equals `right` or `s[left]` becomes 'G', the loop stops.

### Final Output State:
- Since `right` is fixed at 2, the loop will stop when `left` reaches 2.
- At this point, `left` will be equal to `right`, meaning the condition `left < right` will no longer be satisfied.
- Also, since the loop stops when `s[left]` becomes 'G', the character at `s[2]` must be 'G'.

Thus, the final state of the loop is:
- `left` is 2
- `right` is 2
- `s[0]` must be 'S'
- `s[1]` must not be 'G'
- `s[2]` must be 'G'

### Output State:
**Output State: `left` is 2, `right` is 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `s[0]` must be 'S', `s[1]` must not be 'G', `s[2]` must be 'G'**
