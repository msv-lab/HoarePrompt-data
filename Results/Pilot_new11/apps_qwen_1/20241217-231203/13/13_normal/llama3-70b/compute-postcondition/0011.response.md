The code `curr_beauty = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to `curr_beauty`. Since `curr_beauty` was previously unchanged and now explicitly set to 0, the value of `curr_beauty` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, and the character at index `right` in `s` is not 'G'.**
