Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The loop is as follows:
```python
for right in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Variable Initialization**: The loop variable `right` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration until `right` is equal to `n`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `right` is less than `n`.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `left` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'.
   - `max_beauty` is 0.
   - `curr_beauty` is 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `right` must start from 0 (which it already does).
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop condition (`right < n`) is satisfied at the start of the loop. This means `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`left` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0**

This ensures that the loop can start and continue executing based on the given conditions.
