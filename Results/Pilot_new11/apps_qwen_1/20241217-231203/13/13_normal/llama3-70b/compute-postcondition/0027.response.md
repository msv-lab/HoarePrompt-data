Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `left < right and s[left] != 'G'`.
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions must be true.
   - The first condition `left < right` is initially true since `left` is 0 and `right` is 2.
   - The second condition `s[left] != 'G'` is also true since `s[0]` is either 'G' or 'S'.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is 2.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G'.
   - `max_beauty` is 1.
   - `curr_beauty` is 0.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `left < right` and `s[left] != 'G'`.
   - Since `left` is 0 and `right` is 2, the condition `left < right` is already true.
   - We need to ensure that `s[left] != 'G'`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The value of `left` is fixed at 0, so we cannot change it.
   - To ensure that `s[left] != 'G'`, we need to make sure that `s[0]` is not 'G'. If `s[0]` were 'G', the loop would terminate immediately because `s[left] == 'G'`.

### Conclusion:

To allow the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `s[0]` is not 'G'. 

### Final Answer:

State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `s[0]` must be 'S'**.

This ensures that the loop condition `left < right and s[left] != 'G'` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute at least one time.
