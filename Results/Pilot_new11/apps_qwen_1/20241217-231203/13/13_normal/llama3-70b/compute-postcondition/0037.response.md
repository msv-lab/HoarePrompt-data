Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `right` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is 2. Otherwise, `left` becomes 2, `right` becomes 2, `s[0]` must be 'S', `s[1]` must not be 'G', and `s[2]` must be 'G'. If `left < right`, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.***
