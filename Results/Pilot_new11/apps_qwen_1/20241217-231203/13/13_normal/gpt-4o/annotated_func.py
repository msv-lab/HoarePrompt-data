#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies`, a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'. It returns either 0, the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, or the minimum value between this maximum length plus one and `n` based on specific conditions.

The function first identifies all segments of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` and stores them in the `segments` list. If no such segments exist, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of these segments. If there is only one segment, it returns this maximum length. If there are multiple segments, it checks if the start of the next segment is exactly 2 positions ahead of the end of the previous segment. If so, it adjusts the `max_length` accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`. This ensures that the returned value meets certain criteria related to the structure of the segments in `trophies`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `trophies` contains no 'G's, the function returns 0.
- If the segments of 'G's do not have a gap of exactly 2 positions between them, the function returns the adjusted `max_length` without adding 1.

The function handles the case where there might be a gap of exactly 2 positions between segments and adjusts the `max_length` accordingly, ensuring that the returned value is the minimum of `max_length + 1` and `n`.
