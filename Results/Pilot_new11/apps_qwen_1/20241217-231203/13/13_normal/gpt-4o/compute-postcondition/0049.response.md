Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list containing tuples of the form `(start, end)` where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's found in `trophies`, `i` is `n`, `segments` is populated with at least one segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, and `max_length` is the maximum length of consecutive 'G's among all segments, and `len(segments) > 1`**
