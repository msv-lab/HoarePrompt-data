Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'; `segments` is a list containing tuples of the form `(start, end)` representing segments of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`; `i` is 2; `segments` is populated with at least one segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`; `len(segments) > 1`; `prev_start` is the start of the second segment in `segments`; `prev_end` is the end of the second segment in `segments`; `curr_start` is the start of the third segment in `segments`; `curr_end` is the end of the third segment in `segments`; `max_length` is the maximum of 9 and `length_of_current_segment + length_of_previous_segment + 2`. If `curr_start - prev_end == 2`, then `max_length` is updated to the maximum of 9 and `length_of_current_segment + length_of_previous_segment + 2`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
