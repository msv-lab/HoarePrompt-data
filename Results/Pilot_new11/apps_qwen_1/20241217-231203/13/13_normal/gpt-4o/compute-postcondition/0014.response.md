The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, the new value of `i` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list [], `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S'**
