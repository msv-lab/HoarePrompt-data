The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was less than `n-1`, so the new value of `i` is now also less than `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list `[]`, `i` is less than `n-1`, `start` is 0, the current value of `trophies[i]` is 'G'**
