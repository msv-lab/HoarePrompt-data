Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clarifies that the program only identifies and marks 2x2 submatrices where all four corners are 1s. However, this approach fails to address cases where individual elements in the matrix need to be set to 1 through separate operations. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
```
The annotated version shows that the program will incorrectly return -1, indicating it cannot transform matrix `B` into matrix `A`, which is incorrect. The correct solution would involve performing three separate operations to set individual elements to 1. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
