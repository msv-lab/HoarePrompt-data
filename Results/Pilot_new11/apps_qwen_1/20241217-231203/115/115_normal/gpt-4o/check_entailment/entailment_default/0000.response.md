Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code fails to set the entire $2 \times 2$ submatrix to 1 when needed, especially when the $2 \times 2$ submatrix is at the boundary of the matrix. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
3
1 1
1 2
2 2
```

However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the last row and column. It checks for a $2 \times 2$ submatrix within the bounds of the matrix and only sets those elements to 1, but it does not handle setting the last row and column properly. This leads to the final state of matrix B not matching matrix A in the given example. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
