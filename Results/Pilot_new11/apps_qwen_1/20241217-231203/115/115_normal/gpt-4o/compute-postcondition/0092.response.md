Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is the index of the last tuple's first element, `j` is the index of the last tuple's second element, and the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` from all tuples in `operations` are printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple in the `operations` list and prints the elements of the tuple.
- After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be the index of the last tuple's first element (since `i` is initially set to `n-1` and decremented by the loop), and `j` will be the index of the last tuple's second element.
- All tuples in `operations` will have been printed, meaning the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` from all tuples will have been printed.

If the loop does not execute, it means the `operations` list is empty, so:
- `i` will still be `n-1`.
- `j` will still be `m-1`.
- No values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` will be printed.
