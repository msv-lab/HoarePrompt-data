The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. This operation does not change the values of the existing variables `A`, `B`, `i`, `j`, or their relationships. It only adds a new element to the `operations` list.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `i` and `j` are indices within the list such that the submatrix defined by A[i][j], A[i][j+1], A[i+1][j], and A[i+1][j+1] all equal 1; `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `operations` is a list with an additional element `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it.**
