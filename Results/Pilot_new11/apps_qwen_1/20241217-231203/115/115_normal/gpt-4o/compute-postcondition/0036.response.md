The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple containing `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are used to form this tuple. Since `B[i][j] == 1`, `B[i][j + 1] == 1`, `B[i + 1][j] == 1`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true, these conditions remain valid. The variables `A`, `B`, `operations`, and `j` (which is updated to `j + 1`) are affected.

- `A` and `B` remain the same 2D lists of integers.
- `i` remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `j` is updated to `j + 1`.
- `operations` now includes the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` in addition to its previous contents.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is the same as the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`, and `operations` is the list of tuples including the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**
