Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We start with the following information:
   - `A` is a 2D list of integers.
   - `B` is a 2D list of integers.
   - `i` and `j` are indices within the lists.
   - `operations` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` represents a valid operation.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since the upper limit is `n - 1`). This means the loop will run for `n - 1` iterations.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume:
   - `i` was the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `j` was the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `operations` contains all the valid operations performed up to this point.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, if we want the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `i + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `j` remains the same as there is no information indicating it should change in this context.
   - The value of `operations` remains unchanged since the loop is continuing and no new operations have been added.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `j` remains the same.
- `operations` remains unchanged.

**State**: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the same as the previous value, and `operations` remains the same list of tuples**.
