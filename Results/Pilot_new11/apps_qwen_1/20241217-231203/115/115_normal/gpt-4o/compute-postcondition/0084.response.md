Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`. For all `i` in the range [0, `n-1`] and `j` in the range [0, `m-1`], `A[i][j] == B[i][j]`. If any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns 0 after completing all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the 2D lists `A` and `B`.
- If at any point during the loop, an element in `A` does not match the corresponding element in `B`, the function immediately returns `-1`.
- If the loop completes all iterations without finding any mismatch, the function returns `0`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final state of the loop would be:
- `i` and `j` will both reach `n-1` and `m-1` respectively after all elements have been checked.
- All elements in `A` and `B` at the same indices must be equal.
- If any mismatch is found, the function will return `-1` before reaching the final state.
- If no mismatches are found, the function will return `0` after the loop completes.
