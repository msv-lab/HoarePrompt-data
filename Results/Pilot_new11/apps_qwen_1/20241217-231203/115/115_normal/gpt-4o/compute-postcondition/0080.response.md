According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition `m > 1` remains true, allowing the loop to continue.

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2**
