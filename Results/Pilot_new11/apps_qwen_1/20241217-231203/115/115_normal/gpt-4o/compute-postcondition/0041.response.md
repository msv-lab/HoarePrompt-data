Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is met, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to `1` and `operations` includes the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 2)`. Otherwise, the values of `B` remain unchanged and `operations` remains unchanged.***
