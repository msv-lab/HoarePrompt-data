Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information
- `A` is a 2D list of integers.
- `B` is also a 2D list of integers.
- `i` and `j` are indices within the list such that the submatrix defined by `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j+1]`, `A[i+1][j]`, and `A[i+1][j+1]` all equal 1.
- If this condition is met, then `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `operations` is a list with an additional element `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it.
- Otherwise, the values of `A`, `B`, `i`, `j`, and `operations` remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 2`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- We need to determine the state just before the current iteration of the loop starts.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Loop Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
   - Suppose the initial values are:
     - `A` is a 2D list.
     - `B` is a 2D list.
     - `i` is some index.
     - `j` is set to 0.
     - `operations` is a list.

2. **Loop Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
   - Check if `A[i][0] == 1`, `A[i][1] == 1`, `A[i+1][0] == 1`, and `A[i+1][1] == 1`.
   - If true, update `B[i][0] = 1`, `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i+1][0] = 1`, `B[i+1][1] = 1`, and append `(i+1, 1)` to `operations`.
   - If false, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, `i`, `j`, or `operations`.

3. **State Transition**:
   - After the first iteration, if the condition was met, `j` would be updated to 1 (since `j` increments by 1 in each iteration).

4. **Subsequent Loop Iterations**:
   - For the second iteration (`j = 1`), we need to check if `A[i][1] == 1`, `A[i][2] == 1`, `A[i+1][1] == 1`, and `A[i+1][2] == 1`.
   - If true, update `B[i][1] = 1`, `B[i][2] = 1`, `B[i+1][1] = 1`, `B[i+1][2] = 1`, and append `(i+1, 2)` to `operations`.
   - If false, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, `i`, `j`, or `operations`.

5. **General Case**:
   - For any `j` value, the state at the end of the previous iteration will transition to the next `j` value as follows:
     - `j` increases by 1.
     - The conditions are checked for the new `j` value.
     - If the conditions are met, updates are made to `B` and `operations`.

### Final State for the Next Iteration
- Assume the state at the end of the previous iteration was successful, meaning `j` was successfully incremented.
- Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (when `j` is incremented) would be:

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is also a 2D list of integers, `i` is some index, `j` is incremented by 1 (let's say `j` is now 1), and `operations` is a list with an additional element `(i + 1, 1)` appended to it if the condition was met.**

If the condition was not met, the state remains unchanged.

### Example Answer
- If the condition was met for `j = 0`, the state at the start of the next iteration (when `j = 1`) would be:

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is also a 2D list of integers, `i` is some index, `j` is 1, and `operations` is a list with an additional element `(i + 1, 1)` appended to it.**

- If the condition was not met for `j = 0`, the state remains unchanged:

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is also a 2D list of integers, `i` is some index, `j` is 0, and `operations` is a list.**
