Let's analyze the given example step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-2` (since it goes up to `m-1` but stops before reaching `m`).
2. **Previous Iteration State**: We need to consider the state at the end of the previous iteration. For simplicity, let's assume the state at the end of the previous iteration is such that `j` was `previous_j`.
3. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute for `j` in the range `[0, m-2]`. Therefore, if `previous_j` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be `previous_j + 1`.
4. **State Adjustment**: The only state that needs adjustment is the value of `j`, which will increase by 1 for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

- The variable `j` will be `previous_j + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `previous_j` from the previous iteration, we can denote it as `j` being `previous_j + 1`.

Thus, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `j` is `previous_j + 1`**.
