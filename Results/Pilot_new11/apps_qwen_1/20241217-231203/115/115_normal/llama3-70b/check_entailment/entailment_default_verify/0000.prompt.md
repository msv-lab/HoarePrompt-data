You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 2
0 0
0 0
0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for making matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \). Specifically, the program only checks if the elements in a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix of \( A \) are all 1s and skips them, but it does not attempt to set the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices in \( B \) to 1 based on the values in \( A \). Additionally, the program does not handle cases where setting the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices in \( B \) might conflict with already set values, nor does it ensure that all necessary operations are performed to match \( A \) with \( B \). 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 1
```

The program would output `0` because it does not perform any operations, even though setting specific \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices to 1 is necessary to match matrix \( A \) with \( B \). Thus, the program fails to correctly solve the problem for this case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a \(n \times m\) matrix \(A\) where each element is either 0 or 1, along with the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) (where \(2 \le n, m \le 50\)). It identifies all positions \((i+1, j+1)\) within the matrix where at least one of the four adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right) is 1. It then checks if the number of such positions is greater than 2500. If it is, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the count of these positions followed by the positions themselves.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
