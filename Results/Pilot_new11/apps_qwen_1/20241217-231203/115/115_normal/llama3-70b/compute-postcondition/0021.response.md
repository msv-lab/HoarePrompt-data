Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of coordinates `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which the conditions `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true, `j` is `m - 2`, and `i` is the last row index considered.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State:** 
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `m` is the second input integer.
   - `A` is the n Ã— m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `ops` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over columns `j` from 0 to `m-2`.
   - For each column `j`, the loop checks the conditions involving the elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i+1][j]`, `A[i][j+1]`, and `A[i+1][j+1]`.

3. **Conditions in Loop:**
   - If all four elements (`A[i][j]`, `A[i+1][j]`, `A[i][j+1]`, `A[i+1][j+1]`) are 1, the loop continues without adding anything to `ops`.
   - If any of the four elements is 1, the loop appends the coordinate `(i+1, j+1)` to `ops`.

4. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - Since the loop runs until `j` reaches `m-2`, the final value of `j` will be `m-2`.
   - The value of `i` will be the last row index that was considered during the loop execution, which depends on the structure of the matrix `A` and the specific conditions met.
   - The list `ops` will contain all coordinates `(i+1, j+1)` where the specified conditions were true during the loop iterations.
   - The value of `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run at all.

Thus, the final output state reflects the conditions under which the loop executes and the transformations it causes to the `ops` list.
