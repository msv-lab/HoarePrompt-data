The code appends the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, we know that \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i+1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j+1] == 1\), and \(A[i+1][j+1] == 1\), and since at least one of these conditions is true, `ops` contains the element \((i+1, j+1)\). After appending \((i + 1, j + 1)\) to `ops`, the list `ops` now contains \((i + 1, j + 1)\) twice. However, the problem does not specify whether duplicates are allowed in `ops`, so we assume they are. 

The value of `j` remains unchanged, and `m` also remains unchanged. All other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) all equal to 1; if at least one of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i+1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j+1] == 1\), or \(A[i+1][j+1] == 1\) is true, then `ops` is a list containing the elements \((i+1, j+1)\) and \((i+1, j+1)\); `j` is \(m-1\)**
