The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the first and second elements of the `op` list. However, since the initial state does not specify what `op` is, we can only say that the first two elements of `op` have been printed.

Other variables remain unchanged from their initial states:
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `ops` must have at least three elements (though `ops` is not mentioned in the code, it seems related to `op`).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- The first three elements of `ops` have been printed before this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least three elements, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the first two elements of `op` have been printed.**
