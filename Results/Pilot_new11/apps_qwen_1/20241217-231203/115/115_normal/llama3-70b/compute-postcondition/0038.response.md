The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `m - 2`, and the value of `j` is `m - 2`. Therefore, the tuple appended to `ops` is `(m - 1, m - 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) all equal to 1; `ops` is a list containing the elements \((i+1, j+1)\), \((i+1, j+1)\), and \((m - 1, m - 1)\); `j` is \(m - 2\)**
