To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to analyze the given conditions:

1. The for loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`, which means the loop will execute `n - 1` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be a non-negative integer, implying that `n` must be at least 1 (since `n - 1` must be >= 0).

The initial states provided are:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `A` is the n × m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` is an empty list.

Since the loop's condition (`range(n - 1)`) depends solely on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1. Other variables like `m`, `A`, and `ops` do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the provided information.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `m` is the second input integer, `A` is the n × m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list**
