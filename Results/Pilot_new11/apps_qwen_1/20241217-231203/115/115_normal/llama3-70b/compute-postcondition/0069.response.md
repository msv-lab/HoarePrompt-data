According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ops`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `ops` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least two elements, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-1`, and the first two elements of `ops` have been printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `ops` must have at least three elements (since the first two elements have already been printed).
2. `i` should be updated to `i+1`.
3. `j` should remain the same unless specified otherwise in the loop body.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that `ops` must have at least three elements, and `i` must be `n-1` (which is `i+1` from the previous value).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least three elements, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the first three elements of `ops` have been printed.**
