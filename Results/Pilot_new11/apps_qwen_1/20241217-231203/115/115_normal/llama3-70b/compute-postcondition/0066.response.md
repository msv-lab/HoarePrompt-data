The code prints the first two elements of the `ops` list. The values of these elements are taken from `op[0]` and `op[1]`. Since the code does not assign new values to any variables, only prints them, the values of `m`, `ops`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `ops` must have at least one element, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, the code prints `op[0]` and `op[1]`**
