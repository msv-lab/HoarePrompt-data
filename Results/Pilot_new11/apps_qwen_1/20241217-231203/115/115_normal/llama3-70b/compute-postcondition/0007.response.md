Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, no changes are made. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the precondition with the additional condition that the specified elements are all equal to 1.***
