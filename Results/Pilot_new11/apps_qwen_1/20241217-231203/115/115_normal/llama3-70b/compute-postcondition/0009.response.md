The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are known from the initial state: `j` is 0. However, the value of `i` is not specified, only that `m` must be greater than 1, which is not directly related to `i`. The values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` remain unchanged and are all equal to 1. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `ops` and the unchanged matrix `A` elements.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0, `i` is unspecified, `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 1)`**
