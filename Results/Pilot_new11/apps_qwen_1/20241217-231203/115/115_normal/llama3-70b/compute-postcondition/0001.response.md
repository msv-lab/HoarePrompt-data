The code reads an n × m matrix from the input, where each element is either 0 or 1. This operation affects the `A` matrix but does not change the values of `n` or `m`. The initial values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `A` is updated with the new matrix values.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `m` is the second input integer, and `A` is the n × m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.**
