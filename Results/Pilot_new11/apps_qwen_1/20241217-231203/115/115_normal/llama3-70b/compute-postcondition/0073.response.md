The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context, it seems the function should operate on a matrix $A$ which is a $n \times m$ matrix where each element is either $0$ or $1$, and $n$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$. 

Given the output cases are not explicitly provided in the code snippet but inferred from the problem description, the function likely processes this matrix and returns a value based on certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a $n \times m$ matrix $A$ where each element is either $0$ or $1$, and $n$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $2 \le n, m \le 50$, and returns a value based on specific conditions of the matrix elements.**
