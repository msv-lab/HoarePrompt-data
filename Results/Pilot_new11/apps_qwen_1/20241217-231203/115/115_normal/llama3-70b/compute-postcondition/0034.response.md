Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) all equal to 1; if at least one of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i+1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j+1] == 1\), or \(A[i+1][j+1] == 1\) is true, then `ops` is a list containing the elements \((i+1, j+1)\) and \((i+1, j+1)\); otherwise, `ops` is an empty list; `j` is \(m-1\).***
