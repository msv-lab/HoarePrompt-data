The function processes an input consisting of two lines: the first line is a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) representing the number of operations, and the second line is a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing characters "-" and "+". The function counts the number of "+" and "-" characters in the string \( s \). It then compares the count of "-" characters to the count of "+" characters. If the count of "-" characters is greater than the count of "+" characters, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the count of "+" characters and the count of "-" characters. This difference represents the net number of "+" characters in the string after considering the removals indicated by "-".
