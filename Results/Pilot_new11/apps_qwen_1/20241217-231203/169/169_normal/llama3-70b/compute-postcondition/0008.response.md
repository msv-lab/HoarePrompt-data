Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' characters in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' characters in `s`; the function prints `plus_count - minus_count` if `minus_count` is not greater than `plus_count`, and `minus_count` remains unchanged if `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`.**
