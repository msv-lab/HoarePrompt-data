Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to account for the initial number of stones in the pile, which is crucial to determining the minimal possible number of stones remaining after the operations.

For example, consider the following case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  ---
  ```

According to the problem description, if Vasya starts with 3 stones, after performing the operations, the number of stones will be 0. However, the provided code does not consider the initial number of stones. Instead, it only calculates the difference between the number of additions and subtractions. Since the code prints 0 when the count of '-' characters is greater than the count of '+' characters, it incorrectly outputs 0 without considering the initial number of stones.

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to ensure that the initial number of stones is at least equal to the number of '-' operations. The minimal number of stones remaining would then be the initial number of stones minus the number of '-' operations.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    
    # Initial number of stones must be at least the number of minus operations
    initial_stones = max(minus_count, 1)
    remaining_stones = initial_stones + plus_count - minus_count
    
    print(remaining_stones)
```

This corrected version ensures that the initial number of stones is at least the number of minus operations, and then calculates the remaining stones accordingly.
