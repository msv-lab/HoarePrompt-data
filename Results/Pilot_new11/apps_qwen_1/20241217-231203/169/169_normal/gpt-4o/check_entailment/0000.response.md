Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. It initializes `stones` to 0 and iterates through the string `s`. For each '+' character, it increments the number of stones, and for each '-' character, it decrements the number of stones but ensures it does not go below 0. This logic ensures that the program handles all cases as described in the problem statement, including the requirement that the pile cannot be empty before a subtraction operation. The program produces the correct output for all given examples and does not exhibit any logical errors.
