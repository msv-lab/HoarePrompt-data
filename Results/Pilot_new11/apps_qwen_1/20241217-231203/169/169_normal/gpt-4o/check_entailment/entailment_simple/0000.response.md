Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a string `s` containing `n` characters, where each character is either `'-'` or `'+'. This matches the expected input format.

2. **State Initialization**:
   - A variable `stones` is initialized to `0`. This variable keeps track of the net number of stones in the pile after performing all the operations.

3. **Operation Execution**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each character:
     - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the `stones` counter.
     - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the `stones` counter but ensures that `stones` remains non-negative using `max(0, stones - 1)`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all operations, the program prints the value of `stones`, which represents the minimum possible number of stones left in the pile.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the specified operations. Since the input handling, state management, and output generation align with the problem description, the program is correct for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
