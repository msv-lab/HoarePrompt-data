Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The function `func` iterates through the string `s`, which represents a series of operations. For each "+", it increments the count of stones, and for each "-", it decrements the count but ensures it does not go below zero. After processing all operations, it prints the final number of stones, which is the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations. The code handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge case where the first operation is a "-". Thus, the code works as expected for every potential case.
