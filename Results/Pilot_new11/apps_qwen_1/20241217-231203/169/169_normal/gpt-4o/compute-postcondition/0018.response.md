The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n-1` characters either "-" or "+"
- `stones` is either 0 or 2 depending on the first character in `s`

The code snippet is:
```python
stones = max(0, stones - 1)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `stones` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and `stones - 1`.
2. Since `stones` is either 0 or 2, let's consider both cases:
   - If `stones` is 0, then `stones - 1` is -1. The `max(0, -1)` function returns 0, so `stones` remains 0.
   - If `stones` is 2, then `stones - 1` is 1. The `max(0, 1)` function returns 1, so `stones` changes to 1.

Since the value of `n` and `s` are not affected by this code, they remain as they were in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n-1` characters either "-" or "+`, `stones` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character in `s`.**
