The code `stones += 1` increments the value of `stones` by 1. Since `stones` is initially either 0 or 2 depending on the first character in `s`, after the increment, `stones` will be either 1 or 3. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n-1` characters either "-" or "+", `stones` is either 1 or 3**
