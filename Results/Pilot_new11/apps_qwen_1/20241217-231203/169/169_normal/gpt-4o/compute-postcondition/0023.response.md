The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of operations, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, where each character is either "-" (indicating removing a stone) or "+" (indicating adding a stone). Based on the operations specified in the string `s`, the function processes these operations and returns the net number of stones after all operations have been performed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+", and return the net number of stones after performing the specified operations.
