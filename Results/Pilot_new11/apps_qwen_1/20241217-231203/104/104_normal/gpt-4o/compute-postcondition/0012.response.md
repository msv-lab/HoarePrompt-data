Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers representing an array \(a\), where the length of the list \(n\) is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and the elements are strictly increasing integers within the range [1, 1000]. It calculates and prints the maximum value of \(a[i] - a[i-1] - 1\) for all valid indices \(i\) (where \(1 \le i < n\)). The function also handles the case where the list contains only one element, in which case the maximum erase value is 0. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.**
