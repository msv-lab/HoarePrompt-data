Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is unchanged (it means it could be any value up to `n` at this point).
   - `max_erase` is either `j - 1` if all elements in the sublist from `i` to `j-1` satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i`, otherwise `max_erase` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop starts from `j = 1` and goes up to `j = n`.
   - The loop will run as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Conditions to Check**:
   - We need to ensure that the condition for `max_erase` is still met if `j` is incremented.
   - If the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds true for all elements from `i` to the previous `j-1`, then `max_erase` should be updated to `j - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `max_erase` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:

- `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `max_erase` remains unchanged unless the new value of `j` satisfies the condition for updating `max_erase`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `max_erase` remains unchanged**
