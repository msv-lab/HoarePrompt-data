Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, and `j` is `n - 1` or more. `max_erase` is the maximum value between its previous value and `j - i - 1`. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true for all elements in the range from `i` to `j-1`, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `j - i - 1`. Otherwise, `max_erase` remains unchanged.***
