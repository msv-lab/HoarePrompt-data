Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `j` is the last value of `j` for which the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` was satisfied.
   - `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` encountered during the loop iterations.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `n - 1`.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop will increment `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - The variable `j` and `max_erase` depend on the results of the loop body, which we don't know explicitly. However, we can infer that they will remain unchanged unless the loop body updates them.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be updated to `n - 1`.
- `j` and `max_erase` will retain their values from the previous iteration since no information suggests they are updated within the loop body.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is the last value of `j` for which the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` was satisfied, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` encountered during the loop iterations.**
