Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is either `initial_j + 1` or `initial_j`, `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and `initial_j`. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` is true, no changes are made. Otherwise, `max_erase` remains the same.**
