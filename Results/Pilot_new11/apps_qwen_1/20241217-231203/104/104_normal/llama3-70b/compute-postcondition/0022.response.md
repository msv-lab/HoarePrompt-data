Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `max_erase` is the maximum value between its previous value and `j - n + 2`. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` is true, then `max_erase` is updated to `j - n + 2`. Otherwise, `max_erase` retains its previous value.***
