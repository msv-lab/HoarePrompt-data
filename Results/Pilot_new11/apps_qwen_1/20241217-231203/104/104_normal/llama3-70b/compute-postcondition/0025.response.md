Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `j + 1`, `max_erase` is the maximum value between its previous value and `j - n + 2`. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` evaluates to true, then the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged since there is no else part specified.***
