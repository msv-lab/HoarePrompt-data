Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code checks if a subarray maintains a strictly increasing order by verifying if the difference between each pair of elements is equal to their index difference. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the fact that the subarray must still form a valid increasing sequence after erasing the elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 3 4 5 9
```

The code will incorrectly determine that the entire array can be erased because it checks the differences between elements, which is not the correct approach for this problem. The correct solution should focus on finding the longest gap in the sequence that can be erased while maintaining the strictly increasing property.

A more appropriate approach would be to find the longest subarray where the elements can be restored to a strictly increasing sequence. For instance, in the above example, the longest subarray that can be erased is `[3, 4]`, leaving `[1, \_, \_, 5, 9]`, which can still be restored to a valid sequence. The code provided does not implement this logic correctly.
