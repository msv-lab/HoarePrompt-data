Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case when `t` is greater than `n`. According to the problem description, at time `t = n + 1`, the `(n + 1 - k)`-th spectator sits, and this pattern continues for subsequent times. However, the current implementation does not account for this and simply prints `n + k - t` without considering the actual seating pattern.

For example, consider the input `10 5 16`:
- According to the problem description, at `t = 16`, the standing spectators would be the last few after the initial wave has completed and the wave is starting to sit down again. Specifically, the standing spectators would be from `n - k + 1` to `n`, which is `6` to `10` in this case.
- However, the program would incorrectly calculate `n + k - t` as `10 + 5 - 16 = -1`, which is not a valid count of standing spectators.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
