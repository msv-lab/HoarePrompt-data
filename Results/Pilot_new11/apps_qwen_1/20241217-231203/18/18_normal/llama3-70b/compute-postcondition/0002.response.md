The function `func` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. The parameter constraints provided (n, k, and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k) are conditions that should be checked when calling the function, not within the function itself.

Since no specific return cases are given for this function, it implies that the function might perform some internal operations based on these constraints but does not have explicit return values described in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to be defined based on the given constraints without accepting any parameters and returning any specific value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value based on the given constraints.**
