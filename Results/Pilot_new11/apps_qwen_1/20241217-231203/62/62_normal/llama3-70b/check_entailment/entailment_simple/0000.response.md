Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of digits (`n`) and the base (`bx`) for the first number `X`.
   - It then reads the digits of `X`.
   - Similarly, it reads the number of digits (`m`) and the base (`by`) for the second number `Y`, followed by the digits of `Y`.

2. **Conversion to Decimal:**
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` to convert the base-`bx` and base-`by` representations of `X` and `Y` into their decimal (base-10) equivalents.
   - This conversion is done correctly using a simple iterative method that multiplies the current result by the base and adds the next digit.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them.
   - Based on the comparison, it prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=').

The program adheres to the following key points specified in the problem description:
- It correctly handles the input format and constraints (number of digits and bases).
- It uses the helper function `func_1` to accurately convert the numbers from their respective bases to decimal.
- It performs the required comparison and outputs the correct symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison result.

Since the program meets all these criteria without any discrepancies, it can be concluded that the program is correct according to the problem description.
