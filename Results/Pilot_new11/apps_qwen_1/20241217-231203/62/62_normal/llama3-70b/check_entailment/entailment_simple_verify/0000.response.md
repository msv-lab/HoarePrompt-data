Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program incorrectly converts the numbers from their respective bases to base 10 using the `func_1` function and then compares these base 10 values. This approach fails to meet the requirement of comparing the numbers in their original bases. For example, the annotated version shows that the function correctly computes the value of a number in a given base, but the program uses this functionality to convert and compare the numbers in base 10, which does not satisfy the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the given problem.
