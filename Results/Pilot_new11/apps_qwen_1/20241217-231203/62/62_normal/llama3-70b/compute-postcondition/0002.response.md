`result` is assigned the value of `result * base + digit`. Given the initial state where `result` is 0, the calculation becomes `0 * base + digit`, which simplifies to just `digit`. Therefore, `result` is updated to `digit`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, `result` is `digit`**
