Output State: **`decimal_value` is the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in `digits`, `digits` is an empty list.** 

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: Initially, `decimal_value` is set to 0.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - Each iteration of the loop multiplies the current value of `decimal_value` by the base and adds the current digit.
   - After each iteration, the next digit from `digits` is processed.
3. **Final Iteration**:
   - When there are no more digits left in `digits` (i.e., `digits` becomes empty), the loop terminates.
   - At this point, `decimal_value` contains the final decimal value represented by the sequence of digits in `digits`.
4. **No Iteration Case**:
   - If `digits` is empty from the start, the loop does not execute at all, and `decimal_value` remains 0.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `decimal_value` represents the decimal number formed by the digits in `digits`, and `digits` becomes an empty list since all its elements have been processed.
