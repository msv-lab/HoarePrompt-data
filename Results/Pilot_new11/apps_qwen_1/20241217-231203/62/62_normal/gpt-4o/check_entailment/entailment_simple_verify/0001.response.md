Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly converts a list of digits from a given base to its decimal representation. Each call to `func_1` processes the digits of a number in a specific base and returns the decimal value. The main part of the program correctly reads the inputs, converts the numbers to decimal, and compares them. The logic handles all described cases correctly, as verified by the annotations. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
