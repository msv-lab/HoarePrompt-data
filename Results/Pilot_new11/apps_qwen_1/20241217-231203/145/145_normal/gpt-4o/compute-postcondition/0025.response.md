The function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)` calculates the sum of the digits from index 0 to `segment_length - 1`. Given that `segment_length` is equal to `n`, the target sum (`target_sum`) is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket.

Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of the digits, we denote the sum of the first `n` digits as `target_sum`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is the number of segments in the ticket such that the sum of digits in each segment equals `target_sum`, and `segment_length` is `n`.**
