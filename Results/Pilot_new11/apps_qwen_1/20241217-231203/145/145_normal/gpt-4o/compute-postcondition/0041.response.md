The initial state includes `i` being less than `n`, `current_sum` being the sum of `int(ticket[i + 1]) + int(ticket[i])`, `target_sum` being the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` being 1, and `segment_length` being `n`. The given code snippet sets `current_sum` to 0, effectively resetting its value.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is 1, and `segment_length` is `n`.**
