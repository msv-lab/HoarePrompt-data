`current_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[i]`. The value of `i` is also used in this operation, so the new value of `current_sum` is the previous value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_sum` is the previous value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[i]`, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is 0, and `segment_length` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
