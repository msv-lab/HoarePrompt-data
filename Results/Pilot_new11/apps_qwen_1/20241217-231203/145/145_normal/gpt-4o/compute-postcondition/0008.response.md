`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `current_sum`, and `target_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is equal to the current value of `current_sum`, and `segment_count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is equal to the current value of `current_sum`, and `segment_count` is increased by 1.**
