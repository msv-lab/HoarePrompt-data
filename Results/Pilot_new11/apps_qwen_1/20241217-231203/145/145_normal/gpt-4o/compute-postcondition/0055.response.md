`current_sum` is reassigned to 0, which overwrites its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, `segment_count`, and `segment_length`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, `segment_count` is 0, and `segment_length` is 1, and `current_sum` is 0.**
