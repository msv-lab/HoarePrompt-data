`current_sum` is updated by adding the value of `int(ticket[i])` to it. The previous value of `current_sum` was `int(ticket[i + 1])`. After the addition, the new value of `current_sum` will be `int(ticket[i + 1]) + int(ticket[i])`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `target_sum`, `segment_count`, and `segment_length`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `current_sum` is `int(ticket[i + 1]) + int(ticket[i])`, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is 1, and `segment_length` is `n`.**
