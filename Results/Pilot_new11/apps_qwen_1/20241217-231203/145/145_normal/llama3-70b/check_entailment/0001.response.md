Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the ticket is lucky. The function `func_1` only checks if the total sum of the ticket digits is even and attempts to split the ticket into two segments with equal sums, but this approach is insufficient. It fails to consider the possibility of splitting the ticket into more than two segments with equal sums.

For example, consider the ticket `350178`. The program would check if the total sum is even and attempt to split it into two segments, but it fails to recognize that the ticket can be divided into three segments `350`, `17`, and `8` as described in the problem statement.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to explore different ways to split the ticket into multiple segments with equal sums, not just up to two segments.
