#State of the program right berfore the function call: ticket is a string consisting of exactly n digits where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each character in the string is a digit between '0' and '9'.
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    if (total_sum % 2 != 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `ticket` is a string consisting of exactly n digits where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each character in the string is a digit between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`. The total sum of the digits in `ticket` is even
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    curr_sum = 0
    segments = 0
    for digit in ticket:
        curr_sum += digit
        
        if curr_sum == target_sum:
            segments += 1
            curr_sum = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return segments >= 2
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether `segments` is greater than or equal to 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `ticket` consisting of exactly `n` digits (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and returns either `False` or a boolean value indicating whether the number of segments in which the sum of digits equals half the total sum is at least 2. 

Specifically, the function first checks if the total sum of digits in `ticket` is even. If it is odd, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it calculates the target sum as half of the total sum. It then iterates through the digits of `ticket`, maintaining a running sum (`curr_sum`). Whenever `curr_sum` equals the target sum, it increments the segment count (`segments`) and resets `curr_sum`. After processing all digits, the function returns `True` if there are at least two segments where the sum of digits equals the target sum, otherwise it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `ticket` is a string of even length digits and the sum of all digits is even but no segment sums match the target sum, the function will return `False`.
- If `ticket` contains fewer than 2 digits, the function will return `False` because the condition `segments >= 2` cannot be met.
- If `ticket` contains only one segment (i.e., the entire string), the function will return `False` unless all digits sum to twice the single segment sum.
