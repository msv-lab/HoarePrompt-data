The code `curr_sum += digit` increments the value of `curr_sum` by the value of `digit`. Since `digit` is part of the string `ticket` and each character in `ticket` is a digit, let's denote the current digit being processed as `digit`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even.
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
- `curr_sum` is the sum of the digits processed so far and may or may not be equal to `target_sum`.
- `segments` is 3.

After executing the line of code `curr_sum += digit`, the value of `curr_sum` is updated by adding the current digit to its previous value. The output state reflects this change:

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit and no more than 99 digits, `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is the sum of the digits processed so far plus the current digit, and `segments` is 3.**
