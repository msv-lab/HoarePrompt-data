The code initializes `curr_sum` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ticket`, `total_sum`, or `target_sum`. The only change is that `curr_sum` is now 0.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of exactly n digits where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each character in the string is a digit between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` (and is even); `target_sum` is total_sum // 2; `curr_sum` is 0**
