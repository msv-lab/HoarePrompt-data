The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `ticket`. `ticket` is a string consisting of exactly `n` digits where `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and each character in the string is a digit between '0' and '9'. The function returns either `False` or a boolean value indicating whether `segments` is greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `ticket` and return `False` in one case, and in another case, return a boolean value indicating whether `segments` is greater than or equal to 2.
