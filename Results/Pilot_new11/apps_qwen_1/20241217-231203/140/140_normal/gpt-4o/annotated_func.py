#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices), `m` (an integer representing the number of edges), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple `(u, v)` represents a directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`). The function constructs a graph from the edges and checks whether the graph contains a cycle. If the graph initially does not contain a cycle, the function returns `'YES'`. Otherwise, the function iteratively removes and then re-adds each edge in the graph to check if removing any edge would result in a cycle-free graph. If no such edge is found, the function returns `'NO'`. The function returns `'YES'` in all cases where the graph does not contain a cycle either initially or after removing and re-adding any edge, and returns `'NO'` otherwise. This means the function effectively determines whether it is possible to remove any single edge to break all cycles in the graph.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing outgoing edges from each vertex. n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000).

    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `graph` must have at least one key for the loop to execute at least once; if the loop does not execute, `in_degree` remains unchanged.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `in_degree` is a dictionary where the in-degree of each node is updated to reflect the remaining incoming edges after processing, `queue` is empty, `count` is the total number of nodes processed, `node` is undefined.
    return count != n
    #The program returns count != n, where count is the total number of nodes processed and n is the total number of nodes in the graph
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_cycle` accepts a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are integers (vertices) and values are lists of integers (outgoing edges). It also implicitly accepts `n` and `m`, where `n` is the total number of nodes and `m` is the total number of edges in the graph. The function determines whether the graph contains a cycle by performing a topological sort using Kahn's algorithm (a breadth-first search approach based on in-degrees).

After processing, the function returns `True` if the graph contains a cycle (i.e., `count != n`), and `False` otherwise. Here, `count` represents the number of nodes processed during the algorithm.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the graph is empty (`graph` is an empty dictionary), the function should return `False` since no nodes can form a cycle.
2. If the graph has less than 2 nodes (i.e., `n < 2`), the function should return `False` as cycles require at least two nodes.
3. The current implementation assumes the graph is a directed graph without self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, which might not always be the case in practical scenarios. However, the function does not explicitly handle these cases, and the behavior for such graphs would need to be clarified.
