Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case when the graph is empty or has fewer than 2 nodes. According to the problem description, the graph will always have at least 2 vertices (since \(2 \leq n\)). However, the `has_cycle` function does not check for these edge cases. Specifically:

1. If the graph is empty (which is technically possible since `n` could be 2 and there could be no edges), the function will still try to process it, leading to an incorrect result.
2. If `n` is 2 and there are no edges, the graph is acyclic, but the current implementation will incorrectly return `'NO'`.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of both functions to handle these edge cases. For example:

```python
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    if n < 2 or m < 1:
        return 'NO'  # Graph cannot be acyclic if there are fewer than 2 nodes or 0 edges

    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'

def has_cycle(graph):
    if not graph:  # Check if the graph is empty
        return False

    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n
```

With these changes, the program will correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
