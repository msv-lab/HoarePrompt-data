Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Graph Construction**: The `func_1` function constructs a graph using a dictionary where each key is a vertex, and the value is a list of vertices that it points to.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The `has_cycle` function uses Kahn's algorithm (topological sorting) to detect cycles in the graph. If the number of nodes processed during the algorithm is not equal to the total number of nodes, it indicates the presence of a cycle.
3. **Edge Removal Check**: The `func_1` function iteratively removes each edge and checks if the resulting graph is acyclic using the `has_cycle` function. If removing any edge makes the graph acyclic, it returns `'YES'`.

The code handles the following cases:
- Initially checking if the graph is acyclic.
- Iteratively removing each edge and checking if the resulting graph is acyclic.
- Returning `'NO'` if no edge removal makes the graph acyclic.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the code correctly implements the logic to determine if the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints that contradict the problem description. Thus, the code works correctly for every potential case described in the problem.
