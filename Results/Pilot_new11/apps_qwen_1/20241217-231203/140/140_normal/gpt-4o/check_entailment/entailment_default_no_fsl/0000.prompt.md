You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices), `m` (an integer representing the number of edges), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple `(u, v)` represents a directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`). The function constructs a graph from the edges and checks whether the graph contains a cycle. If the graph initially does not contain a cycle, the function returns `'YES'`. Otherwise, the function iteratively removes and then re-adds each edge in the graph to check if removing any edge would result in a cycle-free graph. If no such edge is found, the function returns `'NO'`. The function returns `'YES'` in all cases where the graph does not contain a cycle either initially or after removing and re-adding any edge, and returns `'NO'` otherwise. This means the function effectively determines whether it is possible to remove any single edge to break all cycles in the graph.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `has_cycle` accepts a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are integers (vertices) and values are lists of integers (outgoing edges). It also implicitly accepts `n` and `m`, where `n` is the total number of nodes and `m` is the total number of edges in the graph. The function determines whether the graph contains a cycle by performing a topological sort using Kahn's algorithm (a breadth-first search approach based on in-degrees).

After processing, the function returns `True` if the graph contains a cycle (i.e., `count != n`), and `False` otherwise. Here, `count` represents the number of nodes processed during the algorithm.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the graph is empty (`graph` is an empty dictionary), the function should return `False` since no nodes can form a cycle.
2. If the graph has less than 2 nodes (i.e., `n < 2`), the function should return `False` as cycles require at least two nodes.
3. The current implementation assumes the graph is a directed graph without self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, which might not always be the case in practical scenarios. However, the function does not explicitly handle these cases, and the behavior for such graphs would need to be clarified.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
