Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided checks for cycles using topological sorting through the `has_cycle` function, but it does not correctly simulate the removal of edges. Specifically, the `func_1` function attempts to remove each edge temporarily to check if the graph becomes acyclic. However, the logic inside the loop where it removes an edge and rechecks the cycle is flawed. 

When the line `graph[u].remove(v)` is executed, it only removes the edge from the adjacency list of `u`, but the edge `(u, v)` still exists in the overall set of edges. This means that after removing the edge, the graph might still contain cycles due to other paths between the same nodes. 

To correctly implement the solution, we need to ensure that the temporary removal of the edge affects the entire graph's state accurately. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)

    # Check if the graph is already acyclic
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'

    # Try removing each edge and check if the graph becomes acyclic
    for (u, v) in edges:
        new_edges = [edge for edge in edges if edge != (u, v)]
        new_graph = defaultdict(list)
        for (u, v) in new_edges:
            new_graph[u].append(v)
        if not has_cycle(new_graph):
            return 'YES'
    
    return 'NO'

def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n
```

This corrected version ensures that each edge is removed temporarily and the graph is re-evaluated for cycles accurately.
