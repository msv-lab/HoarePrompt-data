The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since `v` is a key in the dictionary `in_degree` with an integer value, this operation will increase the count of edges directed into the vertex `v` by 1.

- The initial state includes that `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`.
- The value of `in_degree[v]` for any vertex `v` is the number of edges directed into `v`.
- The precondition ensures that `graph` must have at least one key remaining, and `graph[u]` must contain at least one element, but these conditions are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.

After executing the code, the only change is to the value of `in_degree[v]`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for any vertex `v`, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the number of edges directed into `v` plus 1.**
