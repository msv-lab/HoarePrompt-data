According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `queue` contains all nodes that originally had an in-degree of zero. For the loop to be executed one more time, `queue` must contain at least one node.

Since the loop body processes nodes from the `queue` and removes them, after one iteration, the `queue` may no longer be empty but could be updated. However, based on the given information, no adjustments are needed to the states of `in_degree` or `count`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the `queue`. It must contain at least one node for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **All nodes in `in_degree` have an in-degree of 0, `queue` contains at least one node, and `count` is the number of nodes processed.**
