`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The `neighbor` variable is a key in the `in_degree` dictionary, and its corresponding value (which represents the in-degree of that neighbor) is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `queue` does not contain the node that was removed, `count` is increased by 1, and `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor.**
