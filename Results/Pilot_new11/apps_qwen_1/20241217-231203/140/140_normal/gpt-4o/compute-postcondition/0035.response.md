Postcondition: ***`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 (possibly including the newly added `neighbor` after the decrease); `count` is `count + 2`; `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0 if the condition `in_degree[neighbor] == 0` was true, otherwise `queue` remains unchanged and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.***
