In the initial state, `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 (but one node has been removed); `count` is `count + 2`; `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`, and `node` must have at least one neighbor in the graph.

The line of code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decreases the in-degree of the `neighbor` by 1. Since `node` was removed from the queue and it had at least one neighbor, the in-degree of at least one of its neighbors has decreased by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 (but one more node has been removed); `count` is `count + 2`; `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.**
