`queue` appends the value of `neighbor`. The `append` method adds an element to the end of the list, so `queue` now contains the updated neighbors including the new `neighbor`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `in_degree[neighbor]` is updated to its previous value minus 1, `queue` contains the updated neighbors based on the condition plus the new `neighbor`, and `node` is the next node from `queue`.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is updated to its previous value minus 1, `queue` contains the updated neighbors based on the condition plus the new `neighbor`, and `node` is the next node from `queue`.**
