Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `in_degree[neighbor_y]` is decreased by 1.
   - `queue` contains `neighbor_y` if its `in_degree` was 0.
   - `count` is increased by 1.
   - `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `graph[node]`.
   - For each `neighbor` in `graph[node]`, the loop body is executed.

3. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `node`: The current node being processed.
   - `neighbor`: Each neighbor of the current node.
   - `in_degree`: Degree of each node.
   - `queue`: A queue that holds nodes with zero in-degree.
   - `count`: A counter that increments with each iteration of the loop.
   - `graph`: The graph structure where `graph[node]` contains neighbors of `node`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are neighbors in `graph[node]`.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - After processing a neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` might be checked and decremented, and `queue` might be updated if `in_degree[neighbor]` becomes 0.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
   - The key point is that the loop will continue as long as there are neighbors left in `graph[node]`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states for the next iteration such that the loop can execute again:

- `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor (since this condition is given as true).
- `in_degree[neighbor]` should be adjusted accordingly based on the loop body, but we don't have specific information on how it changes in the loop body.
- `count` will be increased by 1 for the next iteration.
- `queue` might or might not change based on the loop body, but we don't have specific details.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`in_degree[neighbor_y]` is decreased by 1, `queue` contains `neighbor_y` if its `in_degree` was 0, `count` is increased by 1, and `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor.**
