Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `visited` is a set including `node` and at least one unvisited neighbor, `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True` and `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `False`. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True`, the function returns `True`. Since there is no else part, the function always returns `True` if the condition is met.***
