According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `neighbor` and the conditions within the loop. The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `graph[node]`. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary.
- `graph[node]` is a non-empty list.
- `visited` is a set including `node` and at least one unvisited neighbor.
- `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition `for neighbor in graph[node]` must hold true. This means that there should be at least one more unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Ensure `neighbor` is valid**: Since `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, there must be at least one `neighbor` in this list. However, the loop condition does not change the value of `neighbor`; it simply checks if `neighbor` is in the list.
2. **Maintain the current state of `visited` and `rec_stack`**: These sets should remain unchanged unless the loop body changes them, but since the problem statement specifies that the function returns without changing the state, these sets remain as they were.

Given the above points, the state remains the same because the loop will only execute if there is another unvisited neighbor, but the specific value of `neighbor` is not specified. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that there is at least one more unvisited neighbor.

**State: **`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `visited` is a set including `node` and at least one unvisited neighbor, `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and there is at least one more unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`.**
