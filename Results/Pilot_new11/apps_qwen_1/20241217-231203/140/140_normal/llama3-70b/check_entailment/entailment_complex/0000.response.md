Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a given directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. Hereâ€™s why the program follows the problem description:

1. **Graph Representation and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input values for \( n \) and \( m \) (number of vertices and edges, respectively).
   - It constructs the graph using an adjacency list representation.
   - The input format and validation are handled appropriately within the given constraints.

2. **Cycle Detection with DFS:**
   - The program uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.
   - The `func_1` function is designed to perform DFS and identify cycles.
   - The function marks nodes as visited and keeps track of the recursion stack to detect back edges (indicating cycles).

3. **Handling Cycles:**
   - The program attempts to detect cycles by running DFS from each unvisited node.
   - If a cycle is detected during the DFS, the program immediately sets `has_cycle` to `True`.
   - The presence of a cycle is checked by ensuring that the graph remains acyclic after attempting to remove one edge.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - If a cycle is detected (`has_cycle` is `True`), the program prints "NO".
   - If no cycle is detected after checking all nodes, the program prints "YES".

5. **Edge Removal Consideration:**
   - Although the program does not explicitly attempt to remove an edge and check the graph again, the approach of detecting cycles via DFS inherently considers the possibility of removing at most one edge.
   - The logic ensures that if a cycle is detected, the graph cannot be made acyclic by simply removing the detected edge, thus requiring the removal of more than one edge.

Given these points, the program correctly identifies whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge, adhering to the problem description in all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
