Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i <= n`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k`.
   - `positions` contains `i`.
   - `i` has been increased by `2 * k + 1`.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `i` was increased by `2 * k + 1`, we need to check if this new value of `i` is still within the bounds of the loop condition.

Given the current state:
- We know `n >= 5 + 2 * k`.
- We also know that `i` has been incremented by `2 * k + 1`.

Since `i` was increased by `2 * k + 1`, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` is still within the range where the loop can continue. Given that `n` is already `5 + 2 * k` (or greater), and `i` has just been incremented by `2 * k + 1`, we don't need to adjust any states because `i` will still satisfy the condition `i <= n` as long as `n` remains `5 + 2 * k` or greater.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the given states to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k`; `positions` contains `i`; `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`**
