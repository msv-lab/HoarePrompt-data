`i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. Given that `k` is an integer between 0 and 1000, the value of `2 * k + 1` ranges from 1 to 2001. Since `i` was initially 2, the new value of `i` will be `2 + 2 * k + 1`, which simplifies to `3 + 2 * k`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `positions` is `[1]`; `i` is `3 + 2 * k`.**
