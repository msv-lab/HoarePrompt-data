The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000. 

Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns `n`.
Case_2: If `k` is not 0, the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` is 0, it returns `n`; otherwise, it returns `None`.
