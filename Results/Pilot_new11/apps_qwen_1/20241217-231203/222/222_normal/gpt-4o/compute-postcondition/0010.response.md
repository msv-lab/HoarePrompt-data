The value of `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`. Since `n` is initially greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k`, and `positions` contains `i` and `i + 2 * k + 1`, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k`
- `positions` contains `i` and `i + 2 * k + 1`
- `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k`; `positions` contains `i` and `i + 2 * k + 1`; `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`**
