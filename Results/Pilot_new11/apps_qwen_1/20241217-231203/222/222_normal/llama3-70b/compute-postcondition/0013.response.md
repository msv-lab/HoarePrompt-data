Functionality: **The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the standard input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). It calculates the largest integer \(l\) such that \(n > (k + 1) \cdot l\), and then generates a list of integers starting from 1 up to \(n\) in steps of \(k + 1\). Finally, it prints the value of \(l\) followed by the list of integers. If \(n \leq k + 1\), the list generated will be empty. If \(n\) is exactly divisible by \(k + 1\), the last number in the list will be equal to \(n\). If \(n\) is not exactly divisible, the last number in the list will be less than \(n\).**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function, including the edge case where \(n \leq k + 1\), which results in an empty list.
