Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `n > k + 2`; `res` is a list containing all integers of the form \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\) for \(0 \leq i < l\).**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\).
   - `l` is calculated as \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\).
   - `res` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `l - 1`.
   - Each iteration appends the value `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` to the list `res`.

3. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - After 1 iteration, `res` contains the value `0 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = 1`.
   - After 2 iterations, `res` contains `[1, 1 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1] = [1, k * 2 + 2]`.
   - After 3 iterations, `res` contains `[1, k * 2 + 2, 2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1] = [1, k * 2 + 2, 2 * k * 2 + 3]`.

4. **General Case**:
   - After `l` iterations, `res` will contain all values of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `0 <= i < l`.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `l > 0`.
   - Since `l` is defined as \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\), the loop will execute if and only if `n > k + 2`.

6. **Final Output State**:
   - If the loop executes at least once, `res` will contain all integers of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `0 <= i < l`.
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `l == 0`), `res` remains an empty list.
   - Given the condition `n > k + 2`, the loop will always execute at least once for valid `n` and `k`.

Thus, the final output state is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `n > k + 2`; `res` is a list containing all integers of the form \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\) for \(0 \leq i < l\).**
