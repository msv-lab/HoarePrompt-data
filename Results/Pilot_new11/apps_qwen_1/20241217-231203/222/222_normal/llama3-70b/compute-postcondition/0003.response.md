To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step-by-step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\).
- `l` is calculated as \(l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\).
- `res` is an empty list.
- The for loop is defined as: `for i in range(l):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(l)` will execute for all values of `i` from 0 to `l-1`. This means that the loop will execute if `l` is a positive integer.

2. **Value of `l`**:
   - `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`
   - For the division operation `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` to result in a positive integer, the numerator `(n + k - 1)` must be at least as large as the denominator `(k * 2 + 1)`.
   - Additionally, since both `n` and `k` are non-negative integers, the minimum value of `n` is 1 and the maximum value of `k` is 1000. Therefore, we need to check if the expression evaluates to a positive integer.

3. **Ensuring `l` is Positive**:
   - To ensure that `l` is a positive integer, we need to make sure that `(n + k - 1) > (k * 2 + 1)`.
   - Simplifying this inequality:
     \[
     n + k - 1 > 2k + 1 \implies n - k > 2 \implies n > k + 2
     \]
   - If `n > k + 2`, then `l` will be a positive integer, and the loop will execute.

4. **Initial Values**:
   - We are given that `n` and `k` are within their respective ranges, but we need to ensure that `l` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The state before the loop must be adjusted to ensure that `l` is a positive integer. This condition translates to ensuring that `n > k + 2`.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000, and `n > k + 2`**.
