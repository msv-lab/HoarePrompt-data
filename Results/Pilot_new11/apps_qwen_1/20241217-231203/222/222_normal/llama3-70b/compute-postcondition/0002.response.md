The code initializes an empty list `res`. This does not change the values of `n`, `k`, or `l`. The only change is that `res` now exists as an empty list. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `res` and retains the unchanged values of `n`, `k`, and `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000; `l` is (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1); `res` is an empty list**
