Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if Kefa can distribute all the balloons among his friends without any friend receiving two balloons of the same color. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each color and then checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends. This approach ensures that if any color appears more times than the number of friends, it would be impossible to distribute the balloons as required. The program handles all given examples and potential cases correctly, making it fully compliant with the problem description.
