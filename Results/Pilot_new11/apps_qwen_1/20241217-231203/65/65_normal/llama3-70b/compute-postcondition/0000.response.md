The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial conditions state that `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 100, and `s` is a string. After executing this line, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on user input.

Output State: **`s` is a string; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input**
