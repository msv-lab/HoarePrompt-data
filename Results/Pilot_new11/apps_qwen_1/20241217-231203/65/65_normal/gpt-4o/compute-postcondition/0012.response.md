Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least one character, `color` is the next character in the string `s`, `color_count` is a dictionary. If `color` is already a key in `color_count`, its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `color` is added as a new key in `color_count` with a count of 1.***
