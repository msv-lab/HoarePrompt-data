Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). It returns either 0 or the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the following conditions:
- \(l \leq a, b \leq r\)
- \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = x\)
- \(a \times b / \text{gcd}(a, b) = y\)

**Specifically, the function performs the following steps:
1. Checks if \(y\) is divisible by \(x\). If not, it returns 0.
2. Calculates \(z = y // x\).
3. Iterates through all possible divisors \(i\) of \(z\) up to \(\sqrt{z}\).
4. For each divisor \(i\), it calculates \(a = i \times x\) and \(b = z // i \times x\).
5. Checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are within the range \([l, r]\) and if their GCD is \(x\) and their product divided by their GCD equals \(y\).
6. If both conditions are met, it increments the count by 1 if \(a = b\) or by 2 if \(a \neq b\).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is determined by the return value:
- If no valid pairs \((a, b)\) are found, the function returns 0.
- Otherwise, it returns the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) found during the loop execution.**

This covers all potential cases and includes the missing logic of checking the GCD condition and the range condition for \(a\) and \(b\).
