The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq a, b \leq r\). The function also assumes that `func_1(a, b)` returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function returns the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, and return the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.**
