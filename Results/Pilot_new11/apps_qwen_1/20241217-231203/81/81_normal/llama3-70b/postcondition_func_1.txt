The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their least common multiple (LCM). It achieves this by first calling `func_1(a, b)` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Then, it calculates the LCM using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \). The function assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers within specified bounds and that `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the GCD. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned, but the function relies on the assumption that `a` and `b` are valid positive integers and that `func_1` returns the correct GCD value. After executing, the function will have computed the LCM of `a` and `b` and returned this value.
