Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implementations of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD and LCM, respectively. However, the main function to solve the problem is missing.

To solve the problem, you would need a function that takes the inputs `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, and calculates the number of good pairs `(a, b)` such that `GCD(a, b) = x` and `LCM(a, b) = y`. The current program does not include this functionality, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
