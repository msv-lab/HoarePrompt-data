You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) respectively. However, the main part of the solution to count the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, and l ≤ a, b ≤ r, is missing.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple case:
- Input: `l = 1`, `r = 6`, `x = 2`, `y = 8`
- Expected Output: `1` (the pair (2, 8) satisfies the conditions)

However, the provided program does not contain any logic to check for good pairs within the given range, compute the number of such pairs, or even utilize the GCD and LCM calculations effectively to solve the problem.

Since the program lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described, it cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their least common multiple (LCM). It achieves this by first calling `func_1(a, b)` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Then, it calculates the LCM using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \). The function assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers within specified bounds and that `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the GCD. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned, but the function relies on the assumption that `a` and `b` are valid positive integers and that `func_1` returns the correct GCD value. After executing, the function will have computed the LCM of `a` and `b` and returned this value.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
