`mex` is incremented by 1. Initially, `mex` is either 2 or 3. If `mex` is 2, after incrementing, `mex` becomes 3. If `mex` is 3, after incrementing, `mex` becomes 4. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 3 or 4**
