The code `print(mex)` simply prints the value of the variable `mex`. The values of `a` and `n` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `a`.**
