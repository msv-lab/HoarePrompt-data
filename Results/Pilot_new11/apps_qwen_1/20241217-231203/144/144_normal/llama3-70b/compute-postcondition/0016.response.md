Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, and `mex` is either 1 or 2. If `num` (which is `n`) equals `mex`, which can be either 2 or 3, then `mex` remains unchanged and is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged and is either 1 or 2.***
