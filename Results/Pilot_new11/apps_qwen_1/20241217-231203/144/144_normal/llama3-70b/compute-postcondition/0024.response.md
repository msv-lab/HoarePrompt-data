The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. The input values (n and the array a) are read from standard input as specified in the problem description. 

The function does not return anything directly based on the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read two inputs from standard input: `n` and an array `a`, but it does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function reads two inputs from standard input: `n` and an array `a`, but it does not return any value.**
