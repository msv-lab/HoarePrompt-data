The code `break` is used to exit a loop, but since there was no loop in the given code snippet, it does not affect any variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `mex` is 1, and `num` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `mex` is 1, and `num` is greater than 1.**
