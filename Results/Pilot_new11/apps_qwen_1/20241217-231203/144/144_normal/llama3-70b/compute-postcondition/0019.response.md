The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement affecting the variables `n`, `arr`, and `mex`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the current element from the list `arr`, `arr` is the list after removing one element, `mex` is either 1 or 2**
