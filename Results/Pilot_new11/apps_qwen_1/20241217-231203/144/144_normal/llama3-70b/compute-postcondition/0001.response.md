The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer. This affects the variable `arr`. The variable `n` remains unchanged because the input was used to create the new list `arr`.

Let's denote the user input as a sequence of space-separated integers. For example, if the input is `1 2 3`, then `arr` would be `[1, 2, 3]`. However, since the exact input is not specified, we will keep the description general.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string**.
