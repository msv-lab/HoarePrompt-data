Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `mex` remains 1 initially.
   - If `num` is equal to 1, then `mex` is updated to 2.
   - If `num` is greater than 1, `mex` and `num` remain unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for num in arr:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `arr`.
   - Depending on the value of `num`, `mex` is either updated to 2 if `num` is 1, or remains unchanged if `num` is greater than 1.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration based on the current state.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `num` was 1 in the previous iteration, `mex` would have been updated to 2.
   - If `num` was greater than 1 in the previous iteration, `mex` and `num` would remain unchanged.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `num` from the previous iteration, we consider both possibilities:
     - If `num` was 1, `mex` is now 2.
     - If `num` was greater than 1, `mex` remains 1.

7. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list `arr`.
   - If `num` is 1, `mex` will be updated to 2.
   - If `num` is greater than 1, `mex` will remain as it is (either 1 or 2, depending on the previous value).

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the value of `num` in the previous iteration. However, since we need to provide a general state without knowing the exact value of `num`, we consider the most general case where `mex` could be either 1 or 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, and `mex` is either 1 or 2.**
