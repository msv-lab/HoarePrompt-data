Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of the mex for the given array. The logic in the program fails to account for the fact that Alyona can decrease any element to any positive integer less than or equal to its original value. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 1
```
The program sorts the array to [1, 1, 2] and starts checking from 1. Since `num == mex`, it increments `mex` to 2. However, Alyona can decrease the second and third elements to 1, making the array [2, 1, 1]. In this case, the mex would be 3 because 1 and 2 are present, but 3 is the smallest positive integer not in the array. 

The program incorrectly outputs 2 instead of 3 because it does not consider all possible values that the elements can be reduced to. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
