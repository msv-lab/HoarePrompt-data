Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Palindromic Substrings:**
   - The program checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s)`. However, the problem requires finding the **longest** substring that is not a palindrome.
   - The current logic only prints the length of the entire string if it is not a palindrome, which is not sufficient to ensure the longest non-palindromic substring is found.

2. **Substring Checks:**
   - The program then checks substrings starting from index 1 (`s[1:]`) and from the end (`s[:-1]`). These checks do not cover all possible substrings of the original string `s`.
   - The program should check all possible substrings of `s` to find the longest one that is not a palindrome.

3. **Logic Flow:**
   - The logic flow in the `else` block is incorrect. It currently handles the cases where the entire string, excluding the first character, and the entire string, excluding the last character, are not palindromes, but this does not guarantee finding the longest non-palindromic substring.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to iterate over all possible substrings of the given string `s` and check if they are palindromes. If a substring is found that is not a palindrome, it should store its length and continue checking other substrings. Finally, it should print the length of the longest non-palindromic substring.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
s = input().strip()

max_length = 0
n = len(s)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n+1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if substring != substring[::-1]:
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The outer loop iterates over all possible starting indices of substrings.
- The inner loop iterates over all possible ending indices of substrings starting from the current start index.
- For each substring, it checks if the substring is not a palindrome.
- If the substring is not a palindrome, it updates the `max_length` if the current substring length is greater than the previously stored `max_length`.

This ensures that the program finds the longest non-palindromic substring and prints its length.
