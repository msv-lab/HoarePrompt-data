Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the longest substring that is not a palindrome. It iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s` and checks if they are palindromes. If a substring is not a palindrome, it updates the `max_len` variable to keep track of the maximum length of such a substring. Finally, it prints the maximum length found or 0 if no such substring exists. This approach ensures that the program works for all given test cases and potential cases, making it correct according to the problem description.
