The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` updates the value of `substr` to be the substring of `s` from index `i` (inclusive) to index `j` (exclusive). Given the initial state:

- `i` is 4
- `j` is 7
- `substr` is `s[4] + s[5]`

Since `substr` is defined as `s[4] + s[5]` initially, this means `substr` is the concatenation of the characters at indices 4 and 5 of `s`. After running the code, `substr` will be updated to the substring `s[4:j]`, which is `s[4:7]`.

So, the updated value of `substr` will be `s[4] + s[5] + s[6]`.

The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `substr` (new value), and `max_len`) are updated as follows:
- `total` remains 0
- `i` remains 4
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 5
- `j` remains 7
- `substr` is now the substring `s[4:7]`
- `max_len` remains 2

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 7, `substr` is `s[4] + s[5] + s[6]`, `max_len` is 2**
