The code `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between its current value and the length of `substr`. Given the initial state:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is 4
- `n` is greater than or equal to 5
- `j` is 6
- `substr` is `s[4] + s[5]`
- `substr` is not equal to its reverse
- `max_len` is at least 1

Since `substr` is `s[4] + s[5]`, its length is 2. Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to the maximum of its current value (at least 1) and 2. Since 2 is greater than any value that is at least 1, `max_len` will be set to 2.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 6, `substr` is `s[4] + s[5]`, `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is 2**
