The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between its current value and the length of `substr`. Given that `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4, the length of `substr` is 2. Since `max_len` is initially 2, it remains unchanged because `len(substr)` is also 2.

The states of the other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 5, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4, and `max_len` is 2**
