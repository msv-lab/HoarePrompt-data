Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` remains unchanged as it is either equal to the maximum of the original `max_len` and 2, `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is set to the maximum of the original `max_len` and 2.***
