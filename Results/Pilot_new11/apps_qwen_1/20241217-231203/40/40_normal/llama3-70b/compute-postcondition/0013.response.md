According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` should be within this range.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50,
- `n` must be greater than 0,
- `max_len` is either equal to the maximum of the original `max_len` and `j - i` (since `substr` is not equal to its reverse),
- `i` must be less than `n`,
- `j` is `i + 1`,
- `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1` (where `i <= j-1 <= len(s)`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented and must still be within the range `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

Given that `j` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be `i + 2`.

So, `i` remains the same, but `j` is incremented to `i + 2`. Since `j` is within the range `i + 1` to `n + 1`, `n` does not change. The substring `substr` will now be the substring starting at index `i` and ending at index `j - 1`, which is `i + 1`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is either equal to the maximum of the original `max_len` and `j - i` (since `substr` is not equal to its reverse), `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1` (where `i <= j-1 <= len(s)`).**
