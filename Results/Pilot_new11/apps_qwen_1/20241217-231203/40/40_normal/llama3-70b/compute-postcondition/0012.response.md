Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is either equal to the maximum of the original `max_len` and `j - i` (since `substr` is not equal to its reverse), `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1` (where `i <= j-1 <= len(s)`).***
