According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1` and `i + 1` is less than or equal to `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 4
- `n` is greater than or equal to 5
- `j` is 5
- `substr` is the character at index 4 in `s`
- `substr` is not equal to its reverse
- `max_len` is at least 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `6`. Additionally, since `i` is 4, the condition `i + 1 <= j` should still hold true. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the loop can continue if `j < n + 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is 6 and the other conditions remain valid.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 6, `substr` is the character at index 4 in `s`, `substr` is not equal to its reverse, and `max_len` is at least 1**
