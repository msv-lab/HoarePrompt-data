Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is either equal to the length of `substr` (if `substr` is not equal to its reverse) or remains 0 (if `substr` is equal to its reverse), `i` must be less than `n`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` (where `i <= j <= len(s)`).***
