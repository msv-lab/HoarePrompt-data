The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length at most 50. It then iterates through all possible substrings of the input string to find the longest substring that is not a palindrome. If no such substring exists, it returns 0. After executing the function, the output will be the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found, or 0 if no such substring exists.
