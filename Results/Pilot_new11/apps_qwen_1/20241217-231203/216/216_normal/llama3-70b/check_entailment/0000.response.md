Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected positions. For example, consider the input:

```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The program will output `2` because it only considers the positions of lowercase letters and does not check for uppercase letters between them. However, according to the problem description, the correct output should be `2`, but the positions selected should ensure there are no uppercase letters between them. In this case, positions 6 and 8 both contain 'a', but there is an 'B' between them, which violates the condition. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
