`current_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_count` was 0, so now it is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing at least one unique character plus `char`, `current_count` is 1.
