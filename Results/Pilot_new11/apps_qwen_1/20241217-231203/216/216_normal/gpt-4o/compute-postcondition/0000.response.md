`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input from the user and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and the condition `1 ≤ n ≤ 200` still holds.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`, `s` is a string consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters**
