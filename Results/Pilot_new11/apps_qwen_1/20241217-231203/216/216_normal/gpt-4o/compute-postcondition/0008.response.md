The code adds the character `char` to the set `current_set`. Since `char` is not already in `current_set`, adding it will increase the size of `current_set` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing at least one unique character plus `char`, `current_count` is 0, the current value of a character in `s` is lowercase, and this character is now in `current_set`.**
