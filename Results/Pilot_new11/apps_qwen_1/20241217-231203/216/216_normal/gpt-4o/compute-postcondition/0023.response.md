Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 1, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0. If `char` is a lowercase character, `current_set` contains all the characters it originally contained plus `char`, and `current_count` is 1. Otherwise, `max_count` remains 0, `current_set` contains all the characters it originally contained plus `char`, and `current_count` is 1.***
