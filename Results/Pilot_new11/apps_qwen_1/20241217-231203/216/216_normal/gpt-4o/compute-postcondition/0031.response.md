Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200 \), `s` has at least one character remaining, `current_set` includes the previous characters and the new `char`, and `current_count` is 2 if `char` is not already in `current_set`. If `char` is already in `current_set`, `current_count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `current_set` is empty, `max_count` is 1 (or remains unchanged if it was already 1 or greater), and `current_count` is 0.***
