Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to account for the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters in the pretty set. The code only checks for uppercase letters at the end of the loop and resets the current set and count, but it does not prevent adding multiple lowercase letters that are separated by uppercase letters into the current set.

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The correct output should be `2` because the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters without any uppercase letters between them is `2`, which can be achieved by selecting positions 6 and 8 (both containing 'a') or positions 7 and 8 (both containing 'b'). However, the provided code would incorrectly output `4` because it does not prevent adding both 'a' and 'b' to the current set despite the presence of an uppercase 'B' between them.

To fix this, the code needs to keep track of the last position of an uppercase letter and ensure that no lowercase letters are added to the set if they come after an uppercase letter has been encountered.
