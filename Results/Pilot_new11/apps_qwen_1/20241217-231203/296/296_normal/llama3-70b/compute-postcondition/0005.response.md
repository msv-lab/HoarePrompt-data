The code assigns the value 2 to the variable `k`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. The initial print statement of 'YES' to the console also remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **'YES' is printed to the console, `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), inclusive, and `n` is not equal to 2; `k` is 2.**
