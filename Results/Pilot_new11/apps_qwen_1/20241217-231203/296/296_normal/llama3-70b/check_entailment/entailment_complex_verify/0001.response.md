Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program fails to handle the case where \( n \) is a prime number correctly. According to the problem description, if \( n \) is a prime number, there is no valid sequence of fractions that can satisfy the given conditions. However, the annotated version confirms that the program outputs "YES" and a sequence of fractions even for prime numbers like \( n = 5 \). This violates the problem requirements, as no such sequence exists for prime numbers. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
