Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly handle the case where \( n \) is a prime number. For a prime number \( n \), there are no divisors \( b_i \) such that \( 1 < b_i < n \). However, the program outputs "YES" and provides a sequence of fractions even in these cases, which is incorrect according to the problem description. 

For example, if the input is `5`, the program will output:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 5
```

This output is invalid because there is no valid sequence of fractions that satisfies the conditions for \( n = 5 \) since 5 is a prime number. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description in its current form.
