Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where $n$ is not divisible by more than one number greater than 1 and less than $n$. Specifically, if $n$ is a prime number, there are no divisors $b_i$ such that $1 < b_i < n$. In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" and provides a sequence of fractions, which is not valid since no such sequence exists for prime numbers.

For example, if the input is `5`, the program will output:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 5
```

However, there is no valid sequence of fractions for $n = 5$ that satisfies the conditions, as 5 is a prime number and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this edge case.
