State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 < n <= 10^9, `divisors` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts with `i` set to 2.
2. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
3. Since `i` starts at 2 and increments, we need to ensure that `i` is within the range defined by the loop condition.
4. Therefore, `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1 for the loop to execute.
5. The initial state of `divisors` being an empty list is already given and doesn't need adjustment.

So, the necessary adjustments are to set `i` to 2 and ensure that `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1 for the loop to execute.
