The code `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state where `divisors` includes the value of `i` and `i` is `i + 1`, we know that `i` was previously assigned a value, let's call it `prev_i`, and now it has become `prev_i + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same.

So, the new value appended to `divisors` is `n // (prev_i + 1)`. The state of `n` and `divisors` (which now includes both its previous value and the new value) is updated.

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `divisors` includes `prev_i` and `n // (prev_i + 1)`, `i` is `prev_i + 1`**
