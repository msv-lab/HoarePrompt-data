The code `k = len(divisors)` assigns the length of the list `divisors` to the variable `k`. Since `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of `n`, the length of `divisors` is stored in `k`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 < n \leq 10^9\), `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `i` is the last divisor found (or `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` if no divisors were found), `k` is the length of the list `divisors`.**
