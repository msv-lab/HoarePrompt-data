Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not generate a sequence of fractions that sum up to \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\) as required by the problem description. Instead, it simply lists all divisors of \(n\) (excluding 1 and \(n\)) and pairs each with 1, which does not satisfy the condition \(\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}\).

For example, consider \(n = 6\):
- The divisors are 2 and 3.
- The code generates the fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\).
- However, \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}\), which is not equal to \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\).

To meet the problem requirements, the code needs to construct fractions such that their sum equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). One possible approach is to use the formula:
\[ \frac{1}{b_1} + \frac{1}{b_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{b_k} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \]

A correct implementation would involve finding a suitable set of divisors and constructing the fractions accordingly.
