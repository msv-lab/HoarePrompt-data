Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function iterates over the number of tasks that can be fully completed (`complete_tasks`), ensuring the time used for these tasks does not exceed `M`.
   - For each iteration, it calculates the points earned from completing these tasks (`complete_tasks * (k + 1)`).
   - It then calculates the remaining time and determines how many additional subtasks can be solved within this remaining time.
   - Finally, it updates the `max_points` if the current configuration yields more points.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - The total time required to complete a single task is calculated as `total_time_per_task = sum(t)`.
   - The loop ensures that the time spent on completing tasks and solving additional subtasks does not exceed `M`.

3. **Subtask Handling**:
   - The nested loop handles the scenario where additional subtasks are solved within the remaining time, ensuring that the maximum possible subtasks are considered.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the code correctly computes the maximum points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit. There are no obvious edge cases or logical flaws that would cause the code to fail according to the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
