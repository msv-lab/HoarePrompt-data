You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45. M is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9. t is a list of k positive integers where each element t_j satisfies 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000.
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        
        if time_used > M:
            break
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        subtasks_solved = 0
        
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and understand what happens during each iteration and after the loop completes.
    #
    #### Initial Analysis
    #
    #- **Variables and Their Constraints:**
    #  - `max_points` starts at 0.
    #  - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
    #  - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
    #  - `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
    #  - `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
    #  - `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.
    #
    #### Loop Execution
    #
    #1. **Outer Loop:**
    #   - The outer loop iterates over `complete_tasks` from 0 to `n`.
    #   - For each `complete_tasks`, it calculates `time_used` as `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
    #   - If `time_used` exceeds `M`, the loop breaks.
    #
    #2. **Inner Loop:**
    #   - The inner loop processes each subtask in the list `t`.
    #   - It calculates `subtasks_solved` and updates `remaining_time`.
    #
    #3. **Update `max_points`:**
    #   - After the inner loop, `subtasks_solved` is adjusted to be the minimum of its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) \cdot k\).
    #   - `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.
    #
    #### Final Values
    #
    #- **After the loop finishes:**
    #  - `max_points` will hold the highest possible value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
    #  - `n` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `k` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `M` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `t` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `total_time_per_task` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `complete_tasks` will be `n` (the last value it took in the loop).
    #  - `time_used` will be `n * total_time_per_task`.
    #  - `points` will be `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point).
    #  - `remaining_time` will be 0 (since the loop ensures `time_used` does not exceed `M`).
    #  - `subtasks_solved` will be the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop.
    #
    #### Output State
    #
    #The final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed will be:
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
    #- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
    #- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
    #- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
    #- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
    #- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.
    #- `complete_tasks` is `n`.
    #- `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`.
    #- `points` is `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point).
    #- `remaining_time` is 0.
    #- `subtasks_solved` is the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop.
    return max_points
    #`max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point), `remaining_time` is 0, and `subtasks_solved` is the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
