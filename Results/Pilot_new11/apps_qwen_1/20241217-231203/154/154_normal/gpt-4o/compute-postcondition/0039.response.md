`subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is defined as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, the value of `subtasks_solved` is updated accordingly. The other variables (`t`, `remaining_time`, and `subtask_time`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must have at least one element, `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**
