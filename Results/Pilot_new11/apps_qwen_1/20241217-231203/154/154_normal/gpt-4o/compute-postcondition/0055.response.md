According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `complete_tasks` and the value of `n`. If `complete_tasks` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `remaining_time` is either 0 or less than the smallest element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, and `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points`.

To determine the new state for the next iteration:

1. `t` remains unchanged as no information suggests it should be modified.
2. `subtasks_solved` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, so it will increment by 1 in the next iteration.
3. `remaining_time` is either 0 or less than the smallest element in `t`. For the loop to execute again, `remaining_time` must be non-zero, meaning it must be updated to be non-zero for the next iteration.
4. `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remains unchanged.
5. `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points`. Therefore, it will be checked if the `points` from the next iteration are higher than the current `max_points` and updated accordingly.

State: **`t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `subtasks_solved` is 1, `remaining_time` must be non-zero (greater than or equal to the smallest element in `t`), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points`**
