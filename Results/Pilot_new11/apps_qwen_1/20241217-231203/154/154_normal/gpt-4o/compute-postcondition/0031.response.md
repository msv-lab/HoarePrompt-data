The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block that is a loop or a conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but indicates that we are breaking out of the loop or the conditional block we are inside. The values of the other variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`max_points` is `max(0, (i + 1) * (k + 1) + min(subtasks_solved, (n - (i + 1)) * k))`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is now equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `(i + 1) * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is unchanged, `subtasks_solved` is unchanged, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
