The code updates the `max_points` variable with the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `points` (which is not defined in the initial state) and `subtasks_solved`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `points`, and `subtasks_solved` is 0. Therefore, `points + subtasks_solved` simplifies to just `points`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `points`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_points`. But we know that `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points`.

The remaining variables (`t`, `subtasks_solved`, `remaining_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `remaining_time` is either 0 or less than the smallest element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points`.**
