Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is increased by the next `max_subtasks_for_this_task` based on the next `subtask_time`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is decreased by `subtask_time` and `subtasks_solved` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `remaining_time` remains unchanged and `subtasks_solved` remains unchanged.***
