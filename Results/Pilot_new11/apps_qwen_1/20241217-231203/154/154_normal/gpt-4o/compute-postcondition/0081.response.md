To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and understand what happens during each iteration and after the loop completes.

### Initial Analysis

- **Variables and Their Constraints:**
  - `max_points` starts at 0.
  - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
  - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
  - `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
  - `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
  - `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.

### Loop Execution

1. **Outer Loop:**
   - The outer loop iterates over `complete_tasks` from 0 to `n`.
   - For each `complete_tasks`, it calculates `time_used` as `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
   - If `time_used` exceeds `M`, the loop breaks.

2. **Inner Loop:**
   - The inner loop processes each subtask in the list `t`.
   - It calculates `subtasks_solved` and updates `remaining_time`.

3. **Update `max_points`:**
   - After the inner loop, `subtasks_solved` is adjusted to be the minimum of its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) \cdot k\).
   - `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

### Final Values

- **After the loop finishes:**
  - `max_points` will hold the highest possible value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
  - `n` remains as it was initially.
  - `k` remains as it was initially.
  - `M` remains as it was initially.
  - `t` remains as it was initially.
  - `total_time_per_task` remains as it was initially.
  - `complete_tasks` will be `n` (the last value it took in the loop).
  - `time_used` will be `n * total_time_per_task`.
  - `points` will be `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point).
  - `remaining_time` will be 0 (since the loop ensures `time_used` does not exceed `M`).
  - `subtasks_solved` will be the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop.

### Output State

The final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed will be:

**Output State:**
- `max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.
- `complete_tasks` is `n`.
- `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`.
- `points` is `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point).
- `remaining_time` is 0.
- `subtasks_solved` is the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop.
