`remaining_time` is divided by `subtask_time` to determine `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. Given that `remaining_time` is 0, dividing 0 by any positive value (including `subtask_time`) results in 0. Therefore, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is increased by the next `max_subtasks_for_this_task` based on the next `subtask_time` in the sequence `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0**
