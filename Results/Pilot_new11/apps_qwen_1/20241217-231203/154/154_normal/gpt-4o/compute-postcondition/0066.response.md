`remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Given that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the quotient of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, the new value of `remaining_time` will be `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`. This simplifies to `remaining_time % subtask_time`, which means `remaining_time` will now be the remainder when `remaining_time` is divided by `subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is the remainder when `remaining_time` is divided by `subtask_time`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the quotient of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**
