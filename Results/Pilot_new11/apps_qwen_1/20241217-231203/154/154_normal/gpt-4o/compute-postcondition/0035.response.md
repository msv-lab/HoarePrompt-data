`subtasks_solved` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`max_points` is `max(0, (i + 1) * (k + 1) + min(subtasks_solved, (n - (i + 1)) * k))`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is now equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged.**
