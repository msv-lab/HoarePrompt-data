To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the relevant parts of the program state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a list of `k` positive integers.
   - `subtasks_solved` is 0.
   - `remaining_time` is \( M - complete\_tasks \times total\_time\_per\_task \).
   - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged.
   - `max_points` is the maximum of its current value and \( complete\_tasks \times (k + 1) \).
   - `time_used` is \( complete\_tasks \times total\_time\_per\_task \).

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for subtask_time in t:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- The list `t` must contain at least one element, because the loop iterates over each element in the list `t`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `t`, and `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `t` must contain at least one element for the loop to start executing.
   - `subtasks_solved` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution directly; it will increment inside the loop.
   - The values of `remaining_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `max_points`, and `time_used` do not directly influence the loop's ability to start but may affect its behavior once the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the list `t` contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`t` is a list of `k` positive integers that must contain at least one element.**
