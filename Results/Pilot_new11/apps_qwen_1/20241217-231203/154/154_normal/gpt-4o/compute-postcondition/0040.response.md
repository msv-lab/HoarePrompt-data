`remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Given that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, we can express the updated `remaining_time` as `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` must have at least one element, `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**.
