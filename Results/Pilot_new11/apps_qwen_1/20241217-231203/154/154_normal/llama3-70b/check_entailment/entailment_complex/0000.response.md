Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `k`, `M`, and the list `t` from the standard input. The constraints and types of these variables match the problem description.

2. **Sorting the List `t`**: The list `t` is sorted, which is necessary for the dynamic programming approach to work optimally. Sorting ensures that the algorithm considers the smallest subtask times first, leading to an efficient way of filling the dynamic programming table.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The 2D list `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(k+1) x (M+1)`. This is appropriate because `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn using the first `i` subtasks in `j` minutes.

4. **Filling the DP Table**: The nested loops correctly fill the `dp` table according to the dynamic programming formula:
   - `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`: This line ensures that the current state is at least as good as the previous state.
   - `if j >= t[i - 1]: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`: This condition checks if the current subtask can be included in the current time segment. If so, it updates the `dp` table to reflect the maximum points earned by including this subtask.

5. **Calculating the Result**: The final step calculates the total points by summing up the values in the last row of the `dp` table (`sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))`) and counting the number of tasks fully completed (`sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)`).

6. **Output**: The program prints the total number of points, which matches the requirement of the problem statement.

Since the program handles all aspects of the problem correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement without any omissions or discrepancies, it meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
