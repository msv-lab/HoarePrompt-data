The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `M`. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45. `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9. Additionally, the function takes a list `t` as an implicit parameter, which is a list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for each j in range(k).

Given the output cases are not specified directly in the problem statement, the function's behavior based on the provided constraints would need to be inferred. However, following the structure of the previous example:

The functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `M` (where `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list `t` of `k` integers (each integer in `t` is such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `M` (where `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list `t` of `k` integers (each integer in `t` is such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000).**
