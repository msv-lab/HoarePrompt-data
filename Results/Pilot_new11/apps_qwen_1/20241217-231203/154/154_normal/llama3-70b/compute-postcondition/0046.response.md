`dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`. Given the initial state where `j` is 2 and `dp[i][2]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`, the value of `dp[i][2]` is updated based on the maximum between its current value and the new value calculated from `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.

Since `j` is 2, the term `j - t[i - 1]` simplifies to `2 - t[i - 1]`. Therefore, the updated value of `dp[i][2]` is `max(dp[i][2], dp[i - 1][2 - t[i - 1]] + 1)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2; `dp[i][2]` is updated to `max(dp[i][2], dp[i - 1][2 - t[i - 1]] + 1); `dp[i][1]` remains equal to `dp[i][2]`.
Output State: **`j` is 2; `dp[i][2]` is updated to `max(dp[i][2], dp[i - 1][2 - t[i - 1]] + 1); `dp[i][1]` remains equal to `dp[i][2]`**.
