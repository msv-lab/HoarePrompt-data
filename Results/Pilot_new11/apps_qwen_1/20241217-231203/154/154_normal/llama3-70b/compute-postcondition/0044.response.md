Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `1`.
   - The condition for updating `dp[i][j]` is if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, M + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = M`.
   - In each iteration, it checks if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.
   - If the condition is met, `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the given formula.

4. **Current Iteration Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `1`.
   - We need to check if `j` can increase within the loop and still meet the condition for updating `dp[i][j]`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by `1` in each iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.

6. **Condition Check for Next Iteration:**
   - The condition for updating `dp[i][j]` is `j >= t[i - 1]`.
   - Since `j` is currently `1` and will become `2` in the next iteration, we need to check if `2` (or any subsequent value) is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`.

7. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `j` will be incremented to `2` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is `2` at the start of the next iteration.

8. **Final State:**
   - `j` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - No other state changes are necessary since the problem does not mention any additional changes to `t[i - 1]` or `dp[i][j]`.

**Answer:**
State: **`j` is `2`**
