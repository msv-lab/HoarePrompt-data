#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and M are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9. The list t is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for each j in range(k).
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 46, `k` is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (k+1) × (M+1) where `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals of length `t[i-1]` that can fit into a segment of length `j`, for all pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ i ≤ k+1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ M+1.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `M` (where `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9), and a list `t` of `k` integers (each integer in `t` is such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000). The function first reads these inputs and sorts the list `t`. It then uses dynamic programming to calculate a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals of length `t[i-1]` that can fit into a segment of length `j`. After the dynamic programming process, the function calculates the total number of non-overlapping intervals across all segments of length `M` and counts how many of those intervals have the same index as their value in `dp`. Finally, the function prints the sum of these two values.
