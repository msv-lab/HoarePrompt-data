The code prints the last two elements of the `unique_numbers` list. Since `unique_numbers` is sorted based on their counts in ascending order, and the counts of the last two elements are both `n // 2`, these two elements must be the same because `n` is an even integer and the counts of the two most frequent elements are equal. Therefore, only the first occurrence of this number will remain in `unique_numbers`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `cards`, `count`, and `unique_numbers`) do not change.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `count` is a dictionary-like object counting the occurrences of each element in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers from `cards`, sorted based on their counts in ascending order, the last two elements of `unique_numbers` are the same and their count is `n // 2`, and the value printed is the last two elements of `unique_numbers`.**
