Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program checks if the last two elements in the sorted unique numbers have a count of `n // 2`, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if the game is fair.

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks if the last two elements of `unique_numbers` (sorted based on their counts) have a count of `n // 2`. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to ensure that the game is fair. For the game to be fair, both chosen numbers must appear in such a way that each player can take exactly half of the cards.

2. **Missing Fairness Check**: The program needs to check if there are at least two different numbers in `cards` that each appear exactly `n // 2` times. If such numbers exist, the game can be fair. Otherwise, it cannot be fair.

To illustrate, consider the following examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    11
    27
    27
    11
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    YES
    11 27
    ```
  - Correct Logic: There are two different numbers (11 and 27) each appearing twice (`n // 2` times), so the game is fair.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input:
    ```
    2
    6
    6
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    NO
    ```
  - Correct Logic: There is only one number (6) and it appears twice, but Petya and Vasya need to choose two different numbers to play the game fairly.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input:
    ```
    6
    10
    20
    30
    20
    10
    20
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    NO
    ```
  - Correct Logic: There are three different numbers (10, 20, 30) with counts 2, 3, and 1 respectively. No two numbers have a count of `n // 2` (which is 3), so the game cannot be fair.

- **Example 4**:
  - Input:
    ```
    6
    1
    1
    2
    2
    3
    3
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    NO
    ```
  - Correct Logic: There are three different numbers (1, 2, 3) with counts 2, 2, and 2 respectively. Although each number appears twice, they are not distinct choices for Petya and Vasya to make the game fair.

To fix the program, you need to check if there are at least two different numbers in `cards` that each appear exactly `n // 2` times. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    
    unique_numbers = sorted(count.keys(), key=lambda x: count[x])
    
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        petya_choice = unique_numbers[-1]
        vasya_choice = unique_numbers[-2]
        
        if count[petya_choice] == n // 2 and count[vasya_choice] == n // 2:
            print('YES')
            print(petya_choice, vasya_choice)
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly checks if there are two different numbers that each appear exactly `n // 2` times, ensuring the game can be fair.
