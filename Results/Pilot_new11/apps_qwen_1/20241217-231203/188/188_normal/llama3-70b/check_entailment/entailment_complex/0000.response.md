Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of cards `n` and then reads `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards. This matches the problem description.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each number in the list `a`. This ensures that each number and its count are accurately tracked. This step is crucial for determining if there are two distinct numbers that appear exactly `n/2` times.

3. **Finding Valid Numbers:**
   - The program iterates through the dictionary `d` to find two distinct numbers that appear exactly `n//2` times. If such numbers are found, it sets `a1` and `a2` accordingly. This is the key logic to check if the game can be made fair.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - If two valid numbers (`a1` and `a2`) are found, the program prints "YES" followed by these two numbers. If no such numbers are found, it prints "NO". This covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases as specified:
     - If the numbers on the cards are not distinct enough to allow two different numbers appearing exactly `n/2` times, it correctly identifies this scenario and prints "NO".
     - If the total number of cards `n` is even but the distribution of numbers does not allow for a fair split, the program also prints "NO".

Given that the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem description, including input validation, counting frequencies, identifying valid pairs, and outputting the result, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
