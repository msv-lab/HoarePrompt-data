Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the cards cannot be fairly divided between Petya and Vasya. Specifically, the code assumes that there will always be two distinct integers that appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times, which is not necessarily true for every potential case.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, the integers 1, 2, and 3 each appear twice, but there are no two distinct integers that appear exactly half the total number of cards (which is 3). Therefore, it is impossible to divide the cards equally between Petya and Vasya.

The code would output "YES" and print two distinct integers, which is incorrect. However, the correct output should be "NO" because it is impossible to divide the cards equally.

Thus, the program fails to handle this case correctly, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
