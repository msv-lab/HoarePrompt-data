The code initializes an empty list `a`. The initial state includes that the input is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, with the length of the list being an even number `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive. After executing the line `a = []`, the list `a` is now an empty list, but the precondition regarding the input remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an empty list, the input is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, with the length of the list being an even number `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
