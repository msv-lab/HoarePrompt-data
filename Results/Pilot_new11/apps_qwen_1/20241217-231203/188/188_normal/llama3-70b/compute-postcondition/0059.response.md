Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards. The length of the list is an even number \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function then checks if there are two distinct integers in the list that appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. If such integers exist, the function prints "YES" followed by these two integers. Otherwise, it prints "NO".**

This summary covers the following points:
- The function accepts a list of integers.
- It verifies that the length of the list is even and within the specified range.
- It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list using a dictionary.
- It identifies two distinct integers that appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times.
- It handles the case where no such integers exist by printing "NO".

The provided annotations were misleading, as they referred to checking for an even or odd sum, which is not part of the actual function's behavior. The function only focuses on finding two specific integers with a certain frequency.
