The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Since the initial state of `d` is an empty dictionary, this means that `d[i]` does not exist initially and therefore, `d[i] += 1` is equivalent to setting `d[i] = 1`.

The other variables (`a` and `n`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{i: 1}`, `i` is in `d`.**
