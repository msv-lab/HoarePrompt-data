The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. The value of `a` and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `c` and the unchanged values of `a` and `d`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 0**
