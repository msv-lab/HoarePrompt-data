According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `d`. The loop will continue as long as there are keys left in the dictionary `d`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements.
- `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`.
- `c` is 2.
- `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, and `a2` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains -1.
- `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the dictionary `d` must still have keys. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, and `a2` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains -1, `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`.**
