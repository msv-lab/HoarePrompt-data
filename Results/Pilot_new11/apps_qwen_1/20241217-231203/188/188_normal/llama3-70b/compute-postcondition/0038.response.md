The code `a1 = i` assigns the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` to the variable `a1`. Since `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`, the value of `a1` will be this next key. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d`, `a2` is either the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains -1, and `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d` after the assignment.**
