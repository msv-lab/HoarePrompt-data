Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, and `a2` is the value of the next key from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each key `i` in the dictionary `d`.
- It checks if the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a` is equal to `n // 2`.
- If `c` is 0, it sets `a1` to the value of `i` and increments `c` by 1.
- If `c` is 1, it sets `a2` to the value of `i` and breaks out of the loop.

Since `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, there must be at least one element in `a` that appears `n // 2` times. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once and set `a1`. After setting `a1`, the loop will continue and check the next elements. If there is another element in `a` that also appears `n // 2` times, `c` will be incremented to 2, and `a2` will be set to the value of `i` from the dictionary `d`. If no other such element exists, `a2` will remain `-1`.

After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `c`, `a1`, and `a2` will be determined as described above.
