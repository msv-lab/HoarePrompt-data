You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, with the length of the list being an even number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer input from the list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, and `a2` is the value of the next key from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2. If both `a1` and `a2` are valid (i.e., `a1 != -1` and `a2 != -1`), the program prints `a1 a2`. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards. The length of the list is an even number \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive. 
#
#Case_1: The sum of all integers in the list is even; the function returns the string "Even Sum".
#Case_2: The sum of all integers in the list is odd; the function returns the string "Odd Sum".
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers and return whether the sum of these integers is "Even Sum" or "Odd Sum".

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
