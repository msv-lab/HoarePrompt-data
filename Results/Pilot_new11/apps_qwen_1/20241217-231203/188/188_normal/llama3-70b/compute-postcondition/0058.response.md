The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards. The length of the list is an even number \( n \) where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100 inclusive. 

Case_1: The sum of all integers in the list is even; the function returns the string "Even Sum".
Case_2: The sum of all integers in the list is odd; the function returns the string "Odd Sum".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers and return whether the sum of these integers is "Even Sum" or "Odd Sum".
