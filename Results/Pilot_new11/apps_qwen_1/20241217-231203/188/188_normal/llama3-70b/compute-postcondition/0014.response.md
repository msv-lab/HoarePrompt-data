The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The variable `a` and the value of `n` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is now a key in the dictionary `d` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair (`i: 1`), and `i` is a key in `d` with the value `1`.**
