Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2. If both `a1` and `a2` are valid (i.e., `a1 != -1` and `a2 != -1`), the program prints `a1 a2`. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.***
