Let's break down the given situation step by step.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer input from the list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
- `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.
- `d` is an empty dictionary.
- The loop is structured as follows:
  ```python
  for i in a:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Control Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

2. **Initial State Before Loop Execution:**
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements.
   - Each element in `a` is an integer.
   - `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `n` is the length of the list `a`, we need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range (even number between 2 and 100).

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the following states:
- `n` should be an even number between 2 and 100.
- `a` should be a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `d` is an empty dictionary**.
