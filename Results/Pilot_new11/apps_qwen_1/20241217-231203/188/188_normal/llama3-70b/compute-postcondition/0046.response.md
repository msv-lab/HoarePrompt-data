The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `c` and retains the original values of `a`, `d`, `a1`, `a2`, and `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 3, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` (the next key from `d`), `a2` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`, or remains `-1`, `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`.**
