The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The states of `a`, `d`, `c`, `a1`, and `a2` are still as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is -1, `a2` is the value of `i` (an element from the list `a`), where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is not equal to `n // 2`.**
