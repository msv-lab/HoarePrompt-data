You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to move the robot from \((0, 0)\) to \((x, y)\). Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5
RUDDL
-1 -1
```

According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum length of the subsegment that can be changed to make the robot move from \((0, 0)\) to \((-1, -1)\).

However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. It attempts to adjust the direction of each operation based on whether it helps reduce the difference between the current position and the target position. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee finding the minimum length subsegment to change.

To fix this, we need to consider all possible subsegments and calculate their effects on the final position. A more appropriate approach would involve dynamic programming or a similar method to explore all possible subsegments efficiently.

Since the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem in all cases, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the sequence is a string of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and x, y are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ux, uy, lx, ly = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string of characters, `ux` is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements), `uy` is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements). If the loop executes, `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the operations in `ops`. If the loop does not execute (`ops` is an empty string), `ux` and `uy` remain 0.
    dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy
    if (dx < 0 or dy < 0) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the last operation in the string, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is the count of invalid operations. `ux` is the sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements, `uy` is the sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `sequence`, `x`, `y`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy` remain unchanged. If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is the count of invalid operations in `ops`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sequence of moves ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and determines the number of invalid operations that would cause the resulting position to be outside the allowed bounds. It starts by reading an integer `n`, a sequence of `n` moves, and two integer coordinates `x` and `y`. It calculates the net horizontal (`ux`) and vertical (`uy`) movements based on the sequence of moves. Then, it checks if the final position `(x - ux, y - uy)` is within the allowed bounds. If not, it prints `-1`. If the position is valid, it iterates through the sequence again, decrementing the remaining coordinates for each move if possible, and counts the number of moves that cannot be applied due to insufficient coordinates, printing this count as the result. The function handles the case where the sequence might be empty, in which case `ux` and `uy` remain 0.
