If the loop executes, `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the operations in `ops`. If the loop does not execute (`ops` is an empty string), `ux` and `uy` remain 0.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `sequence`, `x`, `y`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy` remain unchanged. If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is the count of invalid operations in `ops`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sequence of moves ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and determines the number of invalid operations that would cause the resulting position to be outside the allowed bounds. It starts by reading an integer `n`, a sequence of `n` moves, and two integer coordinates `x` and `y`. It calculates the net horizontal (`ux`) and vertical (`uy`) movements based on the sequence of moves. Then, it checks if the final position `(x - ux, y - uy)` is within the allowed bounds. If not, it prints `-1`. If the position is valid, it iterates through the sequence again, decrementing the remaining coordinates for each move if possible, and counts the number of moves that cannot be applied due to insufficient coordinates, printing this count as the result. The function handles the case where the sequence might be empty, in which case `ux` and `uy` remain 0.
