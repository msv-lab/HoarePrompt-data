Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least two characters. If `op == 'D'`, `uy` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ux` is increased by 1 if `op == 'R'`, and decreased by 1 if `op == 'L'`, while `uy` remains unchanged.***
