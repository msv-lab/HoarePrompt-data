Let's break down the problem step by step to understand how the states should be modified at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- \( n \) is an integer input from the user.
- \( sequence \) is a string of \( n \) characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.
- \( x \) and \( y \) are integers input from the user.
- \( ops \) must be a non-empty string.
- \( ux \) is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements).
- \( uy \) is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements).
- \( dx \) is \( x - ux \).
- \( dy \) is \( y - uy \).
- \( res \) is 0.

### Loop Logic:
The loop iterates over each operation `op` in the string `ops`.

### Conditions within the Loop:
1. If the current operation `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is updated to \((y - uy) - 1\).
2. Otherwise, if the current operation `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is updated to 0.
3. If the current operation `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is updated to \(x - ux - 1\).
4. For any other case, `res` is set to 1, `dx` remains unchanged, and `dy` remains unchanged.
5. If the current operation `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to \(x - ux + 1\).

### State Adjustments for Next Iteration:
- The loop continues as long as there are operations left in `ops` to process.
- At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state before the next operation `op` is processed.

Since the loop iterates through each character in `ops`, at the end of the previous iteration, the next operation `op` is the one being processed.

### Updated States:
- \( ops \): The string `ops` now contains all operations except the one just processed.
- \( op \): The variable `op` holds the current operation being processed.
- \( dx \): The value of \( dx \) may have been updated based on the current operation `op`.
- \( dy \): The value of \( dy \) may have been updated based on the current operation `op`.
- \( res \): If the condition for setting `res` to 1 was met, `res` would be 1; otherwise, it remains 0.

### Final State for Next Iteration:
Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- \( ops \) must be a non-empty string (since we are processing one operation per iteration).
- \( op \) is the current operation being processed.
- \( dx \) is the updated value of horizontal movement.
- \( dy \) is the updated value of vertical movement.
- \( res \) is 0 unless the conditions for setting it to 1 were met.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration is:
State: **`ops` must be a non-empty string, `op` is the current operation being processed, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement, `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement, and `res` is 0**.
