Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string of characters, `ux` is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements), `uy` is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements). If the loop executes, `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the operations in `ops`. If the loop does not execute (`ops` is an empty string), `ux` and `uy` remain 0.**
