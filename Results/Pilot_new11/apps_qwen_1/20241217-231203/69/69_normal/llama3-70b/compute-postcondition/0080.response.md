Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next operation in the string. `dx` and `dy` are updated according to the following rules: if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is already less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `dx` is incremented by 1 if `op` is not 'L' or `dx` is not less than 0, and remains unchanged otherwise. `res` is 0 if `dx` is unchanged or incremented, and 1 if `dx` is decremented.***
