Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least one character, `ux` and `uy` are integers. If the character `op` is 'D', then `uy` is set to -1. Otherwise, `ux` is set to 1 if `op` is 'R' and 0 if `op` is 'L'. The values of `ux` and `uy` remain unchanged if `op` is neither 'D', 'R', nor 'L'.***
