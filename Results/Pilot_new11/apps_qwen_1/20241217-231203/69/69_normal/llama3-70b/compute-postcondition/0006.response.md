`uy` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is an integer input from the user, the string `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', the values of `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least one character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 1 (since it was incremented by 1), `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, and the current value of `op` is 'U'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least one character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, the current value of `op` is 'U'**
