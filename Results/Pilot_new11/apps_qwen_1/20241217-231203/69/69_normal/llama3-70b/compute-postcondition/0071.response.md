Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the current operation being processed, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement, `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement, and `res` is 0. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1. If none of the above conditions are met, then `res` is set to 1.***
