`dx` is decremented by 1. The value of `dx` was previously updated based on the operation `op`, but since the exact value of `op` is not provided, we only know that `dx` is now `dx - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dx` is `dx - 1`, `dy` is unchanged, and `res` is 0.**
