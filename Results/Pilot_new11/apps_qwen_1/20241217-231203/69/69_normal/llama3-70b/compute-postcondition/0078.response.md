Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next operation in the string, `res` is either 0 or 1. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is already less than 0, then `dx` remains unchanged, `dy` remains unchanged, and `res` remains 0. Otherwise, if `op` is not 'L' or `dx` is not less than 0, `dx` is incremented by 1, `dy` remains unchanged, and `res` is set to 1.***
