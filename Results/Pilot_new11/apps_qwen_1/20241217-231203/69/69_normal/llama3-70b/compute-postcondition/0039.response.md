The code `dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy` calculates the new values for `dx` and `dy` based on the current values of `x`, `ux`, `y`, and `uy`. The values of `x`, `ux`, `y`, and `uy` are used to compute `dx` and `dy`. Since the values of `ux` and `uy` are determined by the operations in `ops` (if the loop executes) or are 0 (if the loop does not execute), `dx` and `dy` will be the differences between the original values of `x` and `ux`, and `y` and `uy` respectively.

Given this, the output state will reflect the updated values of `dx` and `dy` based on the given formula, while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string of characters, `ux` is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements), `uy` is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements), `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`.**
