The code prints `-1`, which does not affect any variable's value but changes the output. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: *`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string of characters, `ux` is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements), `uy` is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements), `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`. The condition `(dx < 0 or dy < 0)` is satisfied; print statement outputs `-1`.
