`ux` is decremented by 1. The value of `ux` was previously based on the last processed character in the sequence, but now it is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least two characters, `ux` is the previous value of `ux` minus 1, `uy` is unchanged.**
