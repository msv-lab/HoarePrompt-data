`final_y` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `final_y` depends on the next operation character `op`. If `op` is 'U', `final_y` is initially 1, and after decrementing by 1, it becomes 0. If `op` is 'D', `final_y` is initially -1, and after decrementing by 1, it becomes -2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `final_x` is 1 if the next operation character `op` is 'R', otherwise `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0 if the next operation character `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_y` is -2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `final_x` is 1 if the next operation character `op` is 'R', otherwise `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0 if the next operation character `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_y` is -2.**
