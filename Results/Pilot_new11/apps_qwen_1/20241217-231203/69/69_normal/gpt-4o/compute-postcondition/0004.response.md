The code snippet increments `final_y` by 1. Given the initial state, `final_y` was initially 0. Therefore, after executing the line `final_y += 1`, `final_y` will be 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `final_x` is 0; `final_y` is 1; `x` and `y` are initialized to 0; `op` is the current operation character in the loop, and the current operation character `op` is 'U'.**
