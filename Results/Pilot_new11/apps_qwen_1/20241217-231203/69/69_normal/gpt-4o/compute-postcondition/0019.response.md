`final_y` is incremented by 1. The value of `final_y` was 1 if the next operation character `op` is 'U', otherwise it is -1 if the next operation character `op` is 'D'. After incrementing by 1, if `op` is 'U', `final_y` will be 2, and if `op` is 'D', `final_y` will be 0. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, `final_x`, and `op` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `final_x` is 1 if the next operation character `op` is 'R', otherwise `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 2 if the next operation character `op` is 'U', otherwise `final_y` is 0 if the next operation character `op` is 'D'**
