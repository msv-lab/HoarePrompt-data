The code updates `final_y` by subtracting 1 from its current value. Since the initial state indicates that `final_y` is 0, after executing `final_y -= 1`, the value of `final_y` becomes -1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, `op` is the current operation character in the loop, the operation `op` is not 'U', the current operation `op` is 'D'.**
