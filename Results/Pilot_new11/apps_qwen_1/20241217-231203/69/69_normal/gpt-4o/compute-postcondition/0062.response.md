The code `target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy` assigns `target_pos` a tuple containing the sum of `current_x` and `dx`, and the sum of `current_y` and `dy`. However, the values of `dx` and `dy` are not specified in the initial state, so they are left as variables. The values of `current_x` and `current_y` are updated based on the operations stored in `operations[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `current_x` and `current_y` are updated based on `operations[i]`

After executing the code, the values of `current_x` and `current_y` are already determined based on the operation in `operations[0]`, and `target_pos` is calculated as a tuple.

Since `dx` and `dy` are not specified, they remain as variables. The values of `current_x` and `current_y` are updated accordingly from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is determined based on `operations[0]`, `current_y` is determined based on `operations[0]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`)**
