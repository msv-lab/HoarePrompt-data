The code subtracts 1 from `current_y`, but there is no variable named `current_y` in the initial state. Instead, the code references `current_y`, which implies this variable needs to be initialized before the operation. Given the context, let's assume `current_y` is meant to be another variable that is part of the initial state or should be derived from the given variables.

Since `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, and there is no explicit mention of `current_y` in the initial state, we can infer that `current_y` might be a variable that should have been initialized. However, since the problem does not provide an initial value for `current_y`, we cannot determine its exact value post-execution without making assumptions.

Given the lack of initial value for `current_y`, the best we can say is that `current_y` is decreased by 1, but its original value is unknown. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `current_y` is decreased by 1**
