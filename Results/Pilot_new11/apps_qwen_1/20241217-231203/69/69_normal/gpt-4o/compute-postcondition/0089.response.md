Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `current_x` and `current_y` are updated based on the condition of `operations[i]`; `target_pos` is `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`; `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`; `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`**
