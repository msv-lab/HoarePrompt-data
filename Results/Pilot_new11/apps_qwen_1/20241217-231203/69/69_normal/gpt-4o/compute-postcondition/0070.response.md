`current_x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `current_x` was determined based on `operations[1]`. Since no specific value for `operations[1]` was given, we can only say that `current_x` is now one less than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` is one less than its previous value, `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is unchanged, `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`**
