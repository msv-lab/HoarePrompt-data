`current_x` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`. After executing `current_x -= 1`, the value of `current_x` is `current_x - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x - 1` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x - 1, current_y), 1).**
