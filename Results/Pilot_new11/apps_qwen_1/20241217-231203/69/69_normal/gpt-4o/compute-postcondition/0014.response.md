Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `final_x` is 1; `final_y` is 0; `x` and `y` are initialized to 0; `op` is the current operation character in the loop; `op` is 'R'.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and the if condition ensures that `op` is 'R', the postcondition directly reflects the state where `op` is 'R' and `final_x` is updated to 1 while `final_y` remains unchanged.
