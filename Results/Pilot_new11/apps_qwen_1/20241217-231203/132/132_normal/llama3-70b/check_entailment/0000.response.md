Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where stones can be moved from one pile to another. Specifically, the program only checks if the total number of stones is the same and if the sorted lists of stone counts are the same. However, this does not account for the possibility of moving stones between piles, which is allowed according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```

In this case, the total number of stones is the same (14), and sorting both lists gives us `2 3 9` and `1 7 9`, which are not equal. However, it is possible for a jury member to move 1 stone from the first pile to the second pile, resulting in the second configuration. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs "No" in this case.
