The code `y.sort()` sorts the list `y` in ascending order. Since `x` is already sorted in ascending order and the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`, sorting `y` will make its elements also in ascending order, potentially different from the original order of `y`. However, the sum of elements in `y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `y` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order (potentially different from the original order)**
