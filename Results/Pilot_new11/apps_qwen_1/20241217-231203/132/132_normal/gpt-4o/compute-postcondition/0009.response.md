Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`, and `total_y` is the sum of all elements in the list `y`. If the total value of `total_y` is greater than the total value of `total_x`, the function does not change the state. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed to the console.***
