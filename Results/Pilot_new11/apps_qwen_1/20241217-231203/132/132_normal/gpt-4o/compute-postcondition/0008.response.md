The code `print('Yes')` simply prints the string 'Yes' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`, and `total_y` is the sum of all elements in the list `y`. Total y is less than or equal to total x. After this, 'Yes' is printed to the console.**
