The code `y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string into an integer. The resulting list is assigned to `y`. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `n`. The initial values of `x` remain the same since the code does not modify `x`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `y` and retain the unchanged states of `n` and `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, and `y` is now a list of integers obtained from the input string.**
