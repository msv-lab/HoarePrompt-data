Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program checks if the total number of stones in the second configuration (`total_y`) is greater than the total number of stones in the first configuration (`total_x`). If `total_y` is greater, it prints "No", indicating that the configurations cannot be consistent. However, this check is incomplete because it does not account for the fact that stones can be added to the piles as well as removed. The program should consider the possibility of adding stones, which means `total_y` can be less than or equal to `total_x` for the configurations to still be consistent.

A correct solution would need to verify that for each pile, the difference between the number of stones in the second configuration and the first configuration is within the range of possible moves (i.e., the absolute difference should not exceed the number of stones moved between piles). The current implementation fails to handle this more complex validation.
