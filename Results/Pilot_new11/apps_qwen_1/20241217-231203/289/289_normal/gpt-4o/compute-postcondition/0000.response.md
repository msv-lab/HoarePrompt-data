`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\). Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\)**
