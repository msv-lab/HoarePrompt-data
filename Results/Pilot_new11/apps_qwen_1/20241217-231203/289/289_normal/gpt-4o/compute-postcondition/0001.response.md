The code `max_games = n.bit_length() - 1` calculates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary form (excluding the leading bit) and assigns this value to `max_games`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\), the bit length of `n` ranges from 2 to 60. Subtracting 1 from this bit length gives the value of `max_games`.

For example, if `n` is 10, its binary representation is `1010`, which requires 4 bits. Thus, `n.bit_length()` returns 4, and `max_games = 4 - 1 = 3`. In general, the value of `max_games` will be one less than the bit length of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\); `max_games` is one less than the bit length of `n`.**
