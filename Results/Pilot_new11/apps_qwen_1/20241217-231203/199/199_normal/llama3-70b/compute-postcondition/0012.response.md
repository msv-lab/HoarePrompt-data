Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `ways` is 0.
- `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we will consider its role within the loop.

### Loop Code:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
        ways += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - For each `b`, it checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if `2 * (a + b) == n`.

2. **Effect on `ways`:**
   - `ways` is incremented only if the condition `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` is met.

### Observations:
- If no valid `b` is found that satisfies the condition, `ways` remains 0.
- If there is exactly one valid `b` (i.e., `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`), `ways` is set to 1.
- If there are multiple valid `b`s, `ways` is incremented for each valid `b`.

### Key Points:
- The loop depends on the value of `a` and `n`.
- The loop will run for different values of `a` until it exhausts the possible range for `b`.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop completes, `ways` will be the count of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` satisfy the condition `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`.
- If no such pairs exist, `ways` will remain 0.
- `a` will be the last value used in the loop, and it can vary based on the initial value of `a` and the structure of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The loop will check all possible values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1` and update `ways` accordingly. Therefore, the final value of `ways` will be the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

### Output State:
**Output State: `n` must be at least 2, `ways` is the count of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, `a` is the last value used in the loop.**
