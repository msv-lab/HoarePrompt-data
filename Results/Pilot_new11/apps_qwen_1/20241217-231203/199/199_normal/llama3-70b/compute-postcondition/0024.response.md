Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is the last value used in the loop incremented by 1, `b` is the last value used in the loop within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\), and `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).**
