The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. Since `ways` was initially defined as the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) plus 1 if these conditions hold, and otherwise it remains unchanged, incrementing `ways` by 1 means `ways` now includes this additional count.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them. The precondition that `a` is less than or equal to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\) and `b` is the next value in the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\) also remains valid. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is the next value in the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\), `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) plus 1 if `a != b` and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) holds plus 1.**
