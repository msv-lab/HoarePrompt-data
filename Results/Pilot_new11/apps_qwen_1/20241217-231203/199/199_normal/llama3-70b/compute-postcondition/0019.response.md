`ways` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `n` and `a` are unchanged, and the value of `b` is also unchanged because the code snippet only affects `ways`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is the next value, which is `b_current + 1` and must be within the range \([1, (n - 1) // 2 + 1)\), and `ways` is increased by 1.
