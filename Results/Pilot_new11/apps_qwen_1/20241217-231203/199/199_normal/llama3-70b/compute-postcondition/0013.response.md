Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).
   - `a` is the last value used in the loop.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the last value used in the loop.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `a` should be used, which would be `a + 1`.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - `a` must be less than `n // 2 + 1` for the loop to continue.
   - The new value of `a` will be `a + 1`.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `ways` remains unchanged as it is only updated within the loop body.

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `ways` remains the same.
   - `a` is updated to `a + 1`.

Given that `a` is the last value used in the loop and the loop increments `a` by 1 for each iteration, the next value of `a` will be `a + 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), `a` is the last value used in the loop incremented by 1.**
