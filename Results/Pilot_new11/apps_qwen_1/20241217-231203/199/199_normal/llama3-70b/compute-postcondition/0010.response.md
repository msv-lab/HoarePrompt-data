The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. Since `ways` was either 0 or 1 before this line of code, after incrementing, its value will be 1 or 2, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is 1, `ways` is 1 or 2, `b` will be 1 (if it hasn't already been incremented)**
