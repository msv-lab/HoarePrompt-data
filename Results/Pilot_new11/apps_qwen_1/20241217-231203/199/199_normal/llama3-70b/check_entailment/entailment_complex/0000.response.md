Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input and passes it to the function `func_1`. The input handling ensures that `n` is a positive integer, which aligns with the problem constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9`).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that a rectangle can be formed but not a square.
   - The logic iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` where:
     - `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 2`.
     - `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of two pairs of lengths is equal to `n`, allowing the formation of a rectangle.
   - The additional condition `a != b` ensures that the sides of the rectangle are not equal, preventing the formation of a square.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no valid pairs exist by initializing `ways` to 0 and returning it if no valid pairs are found.

Given these points, the program accurately counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that a rectangle can be formed but not a square, adhering to the problem description in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
