Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The outer loop iterates over possible values for `a` (one of the stick segments), ranging from 1 to `n // 2`.
2. The inner loop iterates over possible values for `b` (another segment), ranging from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
3. The condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the segments can form a rectangle (i.e., opposite sides are equal) and not a square (i.e., no two sides are equal).

For both given examples:
- For `n = 6`, the only valid way is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.
- For `n = 20`, the valid ways are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.

The program handles these cases correctly and does not produce any incorrect results based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
