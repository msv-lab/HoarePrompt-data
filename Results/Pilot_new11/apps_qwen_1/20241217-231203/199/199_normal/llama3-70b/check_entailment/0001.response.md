Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to account for cases where the lengths of the four parts include a length that is not strictly less than the others, which is necessary to ensure that a rectangle can be formed but not a square.

For example, consider the input `20`. The program outputs `4`, but the correct answer should be `5` because the valid ways to split the stick are:
- {1, 1, 9, 9}
- {2, 2, 8, 8}
- {3, 3, 7, 7}
- {4, 4, 6, 6}
- {5, 5, 5, 5} (This is not allowed since it forms a square)

However, the condition `a != b` in the loop ensures that {5, 5, 5, 5} is not counted, but it also excludes other valid configurations like {1, 2, 9, 8} and {2, 3, 7, 8} that should be included. Thus, the program misses some valid configurations and does not cover all cases correctly.
