Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code does not consider all valid ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. The code only considers the case where `b` is equal to `a`, which is incorrect because the problem requires that the four parts can form a rectangle but not a square, meaning all four parts cannot be equal.

For example, in the second test case where `n = 20`, the valid ways to split the stick are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. However, the code will miss these cases because it only checks for the condition where `a = b`. Therefore, the code does not handle all possible cases correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
