Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to consider all possible ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square. The condition `if a != rem // 2:` ensures that the parts are not equal, but it does not guarantee that the parts can form a rectangle. For instance, the case `{1, 1, 9, 9}` is not considered because `rem // 2` equals `1`, but this combination can indeed form a rectangle (1x9, 1x9).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the four parts can form a rectangle but not a square. This means that two pairs of parts must have the same length, but these lengths must be different from each other. The current implementation only checks if `rem // 2` is not equal to `a`, which is not sufficient.

Here is an example where the code does not work correctly:

- For `n = 20`, the valid splits are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. The code correctly handles `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}` but fails to handle `{1, 1, 9, 9}` because `rem // 2` equals `1`, which is equal to `a`.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
