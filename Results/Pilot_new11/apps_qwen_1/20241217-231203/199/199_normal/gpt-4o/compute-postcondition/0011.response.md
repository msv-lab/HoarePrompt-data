Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9 and n is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is `n - 4`. If `rem` is greater than 0 and even, the count is incremented by 1 if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
