Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the requirement to split the array into multiple parts where the sum of each part is non-zero. Specifically, the code fails to check if it's possible to split the array into more than two parts, which is necessary according to the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 -5
```

The correct output should be:
```
YES
4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```

However, the provided code only checks for the possibility of splitting into two parts or determines the entire array has a zero sum without considering the possibility of multiple valid splits. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
