Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the key points:

1. **Handling of Non-Zero Sum Array**:
   - If the sum of the array elements is not zero, the program correctly outputs "YES" and splits the array into a single segment from index 1 to index `n`.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Handling of Zero Sum Array**:
   - When the sum of the array elements is zero, the program aims to find the first non-zero element to split the array.
   - However, the program logic to handle the zero-sum array is flawed:
     - The program prints "YES", "2", and splits the array at the first non-zero element.
     - This means the array is split into two parts: from index 1 to the first non-zero element and from the next element to the end.
     - This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that each subarray has a non-zero sum.
     - For example, consider the array `[0, 1, -1]`. The sum is zero, and the first non-zero element is `1` at index `1`. The program would output:
       ```
       YES
       2
       1 1
       2 3
       ```
       But the subarray `[2]` is invalid because its sum is zero.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the array `A = [0, 1, -1]`:
- The sum of the array is zero.
- The first non-zero element is at index `1` (value `1`).
- According to the program, the output would be:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 1
  2 3
  ```
- This is incorrect because the subarray `[2]` (index `2` to `3`) has a sum of zero.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. If the sum of the array is not zero, simply output "YES" and the entire array as one segment.
2. If the sum is zero, find the smallest segment starting from the first non-zero element such that both segments have non-zero sums.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        left = 0
        while left < n and A[left] == 0:
            left += 1
        
        if left == n:
            print('NO')
        else:
            right = left + 1
            while right < n and A[right] == 0:
                right += 1
            
            if right == n:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', left + 1)
                print(left + 2, n)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that both subarrays have non-zero sums when splitting a zero-sum array.
