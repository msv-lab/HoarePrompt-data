The code `print('2')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the string '2' to the console. Therefore, the only change is in the output, but the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, A is a list of n integers, total_sum is 0, i is 0, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, the output is '2'**
