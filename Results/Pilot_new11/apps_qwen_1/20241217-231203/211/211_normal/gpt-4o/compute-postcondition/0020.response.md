The code `print(i + 2, n)` increments the value of `i` by 2 and prints the sum along with the value of `n`. The value of `i` changes to 4, and the value of `n` is printed as it was in the initial state. The states of the other variables (`total_sum`, `A`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 4; the string '2' is printed to the console.**
