The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but in this case, there is no loop present. Therefore, the variables remain unchanged, and the program exits the hypothetical loop or block of code it was in.

The output state includes the following:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `A` is a list of `n` integers.
- `total_sum` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `A[i]` is not 0.
- The output is '2 2'.
- We have printed '1 1 2 2'.

Since there are no changes made to the variables by the `break` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 0; the current value of `A[i]` is not 0; the output is '2 2'; and we have printed '1 1 2 2'.**
