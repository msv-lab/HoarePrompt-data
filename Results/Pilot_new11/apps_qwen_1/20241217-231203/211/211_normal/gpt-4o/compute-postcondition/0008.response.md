State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, A is a list of n integers, total_sum is 0, i is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(n):` will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must start at 0 and `n` must be a positive integer.
3. The initial value of `total_sum` is given as 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop but is a part of the initial state.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can start executing, we need to set `i` to 0 and confirm that `n` is a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Thus, the required adjustments are to set `i` to 0 and ensure `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is specified to be between 1 and 100, we don't need to explicitly state this range for `n`, but it's implied.
