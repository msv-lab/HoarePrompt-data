The code `print(i + 2, n)` prints the value of `i + 2` followed by the value of `n`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `A` is a list of `n` integers
- `total_sum` is 0
- `i` is 0
- The current value of `A[i]` is not 0
- The output is '2'
- We have printed '1 1'

Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 2` will be `0 + 2 = 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the print statement outputs `2` and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, A is a list of n integers, total_sum is 0, i is 0, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, the output is '2 2', and we have printed '1 1 2 2'**
