The code prints '1' and then the value of `n`. After printing, the values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged. The `total_sum` variable is also not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`; printed output is '1' and `n`.**
