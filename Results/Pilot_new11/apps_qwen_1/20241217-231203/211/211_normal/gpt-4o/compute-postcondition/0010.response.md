The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, A is a list of n integers, total_sum is 0, i is 0, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0**
