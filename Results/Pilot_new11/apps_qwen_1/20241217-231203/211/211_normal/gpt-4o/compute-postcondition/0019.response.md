The code `print('1', i + 1)` prints the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. So, the print statement will output '1 2' to the console. This does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 2; the string '2' is printed to the console.**
