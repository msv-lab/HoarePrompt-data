The code `k = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `k`. This is the only change made to the variables in the given code snippet. The initial state of `prefix_sum` and the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `1`**
