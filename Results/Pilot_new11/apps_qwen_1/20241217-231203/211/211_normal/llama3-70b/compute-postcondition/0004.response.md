The code updates `prefix_sum[i + 1]` based on the current value of `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]`. Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0, the code will affect the `prefix_sum` array. Specifically, `prefix_sum[1]` (since `i + 1` equals 1) will be updated to `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `prefix_sum[0]` or `a[0]`, let's denote `prefix_sum[0]` as `p0` and `a[0]` as `a0`. Therefore, `prefix_sum[1]` will be `p0 + a0`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `prefix_sum[0]` is `p0`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `p0 + a0`**
