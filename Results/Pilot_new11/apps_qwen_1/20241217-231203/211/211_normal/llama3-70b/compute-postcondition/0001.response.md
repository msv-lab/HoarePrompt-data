The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each integer into a list. Since the initial state includes that `n` is an integer input by the user and the array `A` is undefined, after executing the code, `n` remains unchanged, and the array `A` (renamed to `a` in the code) is now a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user; `a` is a list of integers input by the user**
