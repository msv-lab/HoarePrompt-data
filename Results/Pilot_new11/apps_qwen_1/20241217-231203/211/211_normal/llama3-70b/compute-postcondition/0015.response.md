The variable `l` is assigned the value `1`. The initial values of `prefix_sum[0]` and `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` remain unchanged. The value of `k` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `1`, `l` is `1`**
