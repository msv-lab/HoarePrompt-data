`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. Given that `i` is now 2, `prefix_sum[3]` (since `i + 1` equals 3) is calculated as `prefix_sum[2] + a[2]`. Since `prefix_sum[2]` is `p0 + a0` and `a[2]` is not specified, we denote it as `a2`.

Therefore, the updated `prefix_sum[3]` is `(p0 + a0) + a2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `prefix_sum[0]` is `p0`, `prefix_sum[1]` is `p0 + a0`, `prefix_sum[3]` is `(p0 + a0) + a2`**
