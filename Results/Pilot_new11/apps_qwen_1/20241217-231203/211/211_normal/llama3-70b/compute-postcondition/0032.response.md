To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`.
- For `i` from `1` to `n`, `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`.
- The sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`.
- `k` is `1`.
- `l` is `1`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `r` from `1` to `n`. The condition inside the loop is:
```python
if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
    print(k, l, r)
    k += 1
    l = r
```

This condition checks if `prefix_sum[r]` is neither zero nor equal to the sum of the entire array (`prefix_sum[n]`). If the condition is true, it prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`, increments `k`, and sets `l` to `r`.

### Observations from Provided Output States:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `k` is `2`, `l` is `1`, and `r` is `1`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `k` is `3`, `l` is `2`, and `r` is `2`.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `k` is `4`, `l` is `3`, and `r` is `3`.

From these observations, we can infer that:
- `k` will be incremented each time the condition inside the loop is met.
- `l` will be set to the current value of `r` when the condition is met.
- `r` will increment from `1` to `n` during each iteration.

### Final Iteration Consideration:
Since the loop continues until `r` reaches `n`, the last value of `r` will be `n`. At this point, the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` might no longer hold because `r` will be `n`, and `prefix_sum[r]` will be `prefix_sum[n]`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop increments `k` each time the condition is met and `r` will eventually reach `n`, `k` will be incremented to `n+1` (since it starts from `1` and increments `n` times). However, `k` will not exceed `n+1` because the loop will stop when `r` is `n`.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, the final state of the variables will be:
- `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`.
- `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`.
- The sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`.
- `k` is `n+1`.
- `l` is the largest index `r` that satisfied the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]`, which could be any value from `1` to `n-1` (if such an `r` exists), otherwise `l` will be `n`.
- `r` will be `n`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `n+1`, `l` is the largest index `r` such that `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]`, and `r` is `n`**.
