Postcondition: ***`prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. If `prefix_sum[n]` equals 0, then no changes are made. Otherwise, `k` is set to `n+1`, `l` is the largest index `r` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is neither 0 nor equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, and `n` remains unchanged.***
