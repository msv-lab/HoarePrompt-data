The code initializes a list `prefix_sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The length of this list is `n + 1`. The initial values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user; `a` is a list of integers input by the user; `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
