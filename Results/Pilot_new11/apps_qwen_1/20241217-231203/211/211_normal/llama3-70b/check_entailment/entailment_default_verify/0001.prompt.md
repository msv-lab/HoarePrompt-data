You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that each subarray has a non-zero sum and that the subarrays, when concatenated, form the original array. Here’s a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
-1 1 -1
```

The program outputs:
```
YES
1
1 3
```

However, this is incorrect because the entire array `[-1, 1, -1]` does not meet the requirement that each subarray's sum should be non-zero. The correct output should either be `NO` or split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that each subarray has a non-zero sum. The current implementation does not check for this condition properly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and an array `A` of `n` integers from the standard input. It calculates the prefix sums of the array `A` and stores them in the list `prefix_sum`. After calculating the prefix sums, the function checks if the sum of the entire array `A` is zero. If it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the largest index `r` such that the prefix sum up to `r` is neither zero nor equal to the total sum of the array `A`. It then prints the starting and ending indices `k` and `l` for each subarray whose sum is non-zero and not equal to the total sum. The function finally prints `k` and `l` again for the entire array `A`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the input array `A` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the function does not handle this case. In practice, the function would need to check for this condition and possibly handle it appropriately.
2. The function assumes that the input values for `n` and the elements of `A` are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3). However, it does not validate these inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the inputs are out of range.
3. The function correctly handles the case where the sum of the entire array `A` is zero, printing 'NO' and not finding any subarrays. This is correctly reflected in the postcondition.
4. The function correctly identifies the largest index `r` such that the prefix sum up to `r` is neither zero nor equal to the total sum of the array `A`. This ensures that the printed subarrays cover all valid segments.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
