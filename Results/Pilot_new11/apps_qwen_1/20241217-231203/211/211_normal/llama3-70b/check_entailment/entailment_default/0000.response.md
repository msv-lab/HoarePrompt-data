Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly splitting the array \(A\) into subarrays where the sum of each subarray is non-zero and forms the original array \(A\).

1. **Handling of Empty Array**: The code does not handle the case where \(n = 0\) (i.e., the input array is empty). According to the problem description, if the array is empty, the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation does not check for this case, leading to undefined behavior.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Subarrays**: The logic used to find subarrays where the sum is non-zero is flawed. Specifically, the loop iterates through the prefix sums to find indices where the prefix sum is neither zero nor equal to the total sum. However, this does not guarantee that the subarrays formed will satisfy the condition that their sum is non-zero. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   4
   1 2 3 -6
   ```
   The prefix sums are:
   ```
   [0, 1, 3, 6, 0]
   ```
   The function will incorrectly identify subarrays without ensuring that each subarray sum is non-zero.

3. **Output Format**: The output format specified in the problem description requires printing "YES" followed by the number of subarrays and the indices of the subarrays. The current implementation does not correctly format the output for all cases.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
