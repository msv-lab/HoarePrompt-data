Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all cases where the array cannot be split into subarrays with non-zero sums. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that each subarray has a non-zero sum, which is a critical requirement. For example, consider the input:

```
3
-1 1 -1
```

The program incorrectly outputs:
```
YES
1
1 3
```

However, the subarray `[-1, 1, -1]` does not meet the requirement that each subarray's sum should be non-zero. The correct output should be `NO`.

The program only checks if `prefix_sum[n]` is zero and prints `NO` in that case, but it does not correctly identify and split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program needs further refinement to handle such edge cases properly.
