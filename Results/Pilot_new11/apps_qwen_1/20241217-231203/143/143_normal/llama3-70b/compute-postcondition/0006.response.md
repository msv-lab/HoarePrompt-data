Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is an integer between 1 and 30; `L` must be at least 1; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\); `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements with the first element set to 0 and the rest set to `float('inf')`; `vol` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` calculates the value of `vol` based on the current value of `j`. Since `j` is initially 0, `vol` becomes \(2^0 - 1 = 1\). All other variables remain unchanged.
