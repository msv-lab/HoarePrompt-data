Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop statement step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `L` must be at least 1
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\)
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input
- `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` using the given items
- `j` is 0
- `i` is 4
- `vol` is 0
- If `vol` is less than or equal to 4, `dp[4]` remains unchanged

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range `range(n)`.
2. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
3. **Loop Condition**: Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1 and become 1.

### Adjusted States for Next Iteration:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- All other states remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop condition directly.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `L` must be at least 1; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\); `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` using the given items; `j` is 1; `i` is 4; `vol` is 0**

The state adjustment focuses only on updating the value of `j` to 1 while keeping all other variables and conditions intact.
