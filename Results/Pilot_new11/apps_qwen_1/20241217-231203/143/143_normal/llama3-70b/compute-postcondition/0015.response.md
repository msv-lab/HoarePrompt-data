The initial state is:
- `j` is 2
- `vol` is 1
- `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[1])`
- `n` remains the same
- `L` remains the same
- `c` remains the same
- `costs` remains the same

The code snippet is:
```python
vol = 2 ** j - 1
```

This line calculates `vol` as `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 2, the calculation is:
\[ vol = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \]

The other variables (`dp[i]`, `n`, `L`, `c`, `costs`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `vol` is 3, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[1])`, `n` remains the same, `L` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `costs` remains the same**
