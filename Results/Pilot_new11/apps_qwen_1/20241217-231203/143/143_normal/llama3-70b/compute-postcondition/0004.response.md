To ensure the for loop executes correctly, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start and iterate properly. Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and increments `i` by 1 until `i` is less than or equal to `L`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will run as long as `i` is within the range `[1, L+1)`.
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `L`, inclusive.

Given these points, we need to ensure that:
- `i` is at least 1.
- `i` is less than or equal to `L`.

Since `i` starts from 1, the primary condition to ensure the loop executes is that `L` must be at least 1. This ensures there are iterations to perform within the loop.

Let's summarize the required states to be adjusted:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
- `L` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) (inclusive).
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) (inclusive).
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input.
- `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements with the first element set to 0 and the rest set to `float('inf')`.

The key adjustment needed is to ensure that `L` is at least 1 so that the loop can start and iterate.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` must be at least 1, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements with the first element set to 0 and the rest set to `float('inf')`**.
