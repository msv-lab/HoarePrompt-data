The code snippet updates the `dp` list based on the current values of `i`, `vol`, and `j`. Specifically, it calculates `dp[i]` using the formula `min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])`. Since `vol` is 1, this simplifies to updating `dp[i]` to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[j])`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `vol` is 1
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30
- `L` is at least 1
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\)
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input
- `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements with the first element set to 0 and the rest set to `float('inf')`
- `vol` is 1

After executing the line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])`, we get:
- `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[j])`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `vol`, and `costs` are not specified, we represent them in their general form. However, `j` is explicitly given as 1 and `vol` is 1.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `vol` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[1])`, `n` remains the same, `L` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `costs` remains the same.**
