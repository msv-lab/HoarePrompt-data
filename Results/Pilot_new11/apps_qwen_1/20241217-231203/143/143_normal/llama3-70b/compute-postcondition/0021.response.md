Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `L` must be at least 1, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` using the given items, `j` is `n - 1`, and `i` is 3, `vol` is \(2^{(n-1)} - 1\)**
