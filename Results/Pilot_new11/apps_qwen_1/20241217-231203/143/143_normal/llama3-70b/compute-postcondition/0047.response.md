Postcondition: ***`dp[4]` is updated to `min(dp[4], dp[1] + costs[2])` and remains unchanged if `vol > i`. `n` must be greater than 0; `L` must be at least 1; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\); `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements; `j` is 2; `i` is 4; `vol` is 3.***
