The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 30), `L` (a positive integer up to \(10^9\)), and `costs` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the cost of bottles). It computes the minimum cost to buy a certain number of bottles such that the total quantity is exactly `L`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and updates it based on the given costs and a modified version of `costs`. It then iterates backward through `dp` to determine the minimum cost by considering the maximum possible quantities that can be bought without exceeding `L`. The function returns the minimum cost found.
