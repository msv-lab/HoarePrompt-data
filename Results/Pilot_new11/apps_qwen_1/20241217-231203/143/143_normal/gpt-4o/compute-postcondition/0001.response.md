The code initializes a list `dp` with the value `max_cost` (which is 10) repeated 31 times. This means that each element in the `dp` list is set to 10.

The variables `n`, `L`, `costs`, and `max_cost` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as they were initially.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of a specific type (1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9), `max_cost` is 10, `dp` is a list of 31 elements, each initialized to 10**.
