The code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])` is executed with the given initial state. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `i` is initially set to 2.
2. `dp[0]` is `c[0]`.
3. `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`.
4. `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`.

The code updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `c[i]`. Since `i` is 2, the line of code specifically updates `dp[2]` to be the minimum of `dp[2]` and `c[2]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2; `dp[0]` is `c[0]`; `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`; `dp[2]` is the minimum of `dp[2]` and `c[2]`; `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`**.
