The code assigns the value `10 ** 18` to the variable `max_cost`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `L`, or the `costs` list. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of a specific type (1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9), and `max_cost` is 10 ** 18.**
