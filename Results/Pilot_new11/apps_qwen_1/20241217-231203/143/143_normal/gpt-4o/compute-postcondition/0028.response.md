Postcondition: ***`i` is 29, `dp[29]` is the minimum of the original `dp[29]` and `c[29]`, `current_cost` is either `2 * dp[29]` or `dp[29]` depending on the condition in the if part, `L` is `L_initial - 2^29` if `L_initial >= 2^29` or 0 otherwise, and `answer` is updated based on the condition in the code.***
