The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `cakes`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively, with the constraints 1 <= radius_i, height_i <= 10 000. Additionally, there is an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 100 000. However, since `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the function signature, it is assumed to be a global variable or passed as a separate parameter not shown here.

Based on the provided output cases, it is not explicitly clear what the function returns without more detailed information about the logic. But from the constraints and relationships given, we can infer that the function likely processes the list of cakes in some way related to the integer `n`.

Given the lack of explicit return statements in the provided output, we can only state the input parameters and the nature of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `cakes`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively.
