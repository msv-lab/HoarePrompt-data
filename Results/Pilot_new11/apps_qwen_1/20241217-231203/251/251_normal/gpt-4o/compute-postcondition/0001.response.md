`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`. This means `n` is converted from the first element in the `data` list to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
