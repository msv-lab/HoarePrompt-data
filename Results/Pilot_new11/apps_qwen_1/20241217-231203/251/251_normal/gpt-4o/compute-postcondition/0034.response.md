According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates from `j = i-1` down to `j = 0`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` remains the same
- `j` is `n-2`
- `dp[n]` is `max(dp[n], dp[n-2] + volumes[n])`
- `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`
- `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]` in the if part

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` becomes `n-3`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains the same, `j` is `n-3`, `dp[n]` is `max(dp[n], dp[n-2] + volumes[n])`, and `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`.**
