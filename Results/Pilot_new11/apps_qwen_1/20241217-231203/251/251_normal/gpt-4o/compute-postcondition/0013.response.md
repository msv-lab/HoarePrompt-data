Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `dp[0]` is equal to `max(volumes[0], dp[1] + volumes[0])`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), and `j` is 1. If `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, then the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the if part.**
