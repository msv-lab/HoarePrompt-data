The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `cakes` is not affected. Therefore, `n` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), and `cakes` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
