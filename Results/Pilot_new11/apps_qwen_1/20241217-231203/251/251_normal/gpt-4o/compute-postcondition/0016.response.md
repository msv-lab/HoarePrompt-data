The code `dp[i] = volumes[i]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be equal to `volumes[i]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `i` remains the same.
- `dp[i]` is now equal to `volumes[i]`.
- `n` remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `dp[i]` is `volumes[i]`, `n` remains the same**
