Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input values for radius and height exceed the specified limits (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000). Although the code reads the input and processes it, it does not check if the values are within the valid range. If a cake has a radius or height greater than 10,000, the volume calculation will produce incorrect results, leading to an incorrect final volume. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
