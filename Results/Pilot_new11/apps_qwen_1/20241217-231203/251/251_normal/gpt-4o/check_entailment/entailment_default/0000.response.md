Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Volume Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi \times r_i \times r_i \times h_i \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses dynamic programming to find the maximum possible volume of the special cake that can be built by stacking the cakes in a way that each subsequent cake has a strictly greater volume than the previous one. This is achieved through the `dp` array, where `dp[i]` stores the maximum volume that can be achieved by including the `i`-th cake.

3. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, processes it, and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments. It then prints the result formatted to six decimal places.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code seems to correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically:
- It calculates volumes correctly.
- It uses dynamic programming to find the maximum possible volume.
- It handles the input processing correctly.

Since the code follows the problem description and the hints agree with the implementation, there are no cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
