Postcondition: ***`dp[i]` is an integer. If there exists a `j` such that `j < i` and `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged. Additionally, `cakes[i][1] < cakes[i-1][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[i-1][2]` hold true.***
