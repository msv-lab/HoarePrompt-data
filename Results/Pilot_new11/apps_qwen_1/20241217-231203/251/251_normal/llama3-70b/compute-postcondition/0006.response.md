`r` and `h` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 as per the precondition. The list `cakes` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `cakes` is now ['(\(\pi\) * \(r^2\) * \(h\), \(r\), \(h\))'], `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer**
