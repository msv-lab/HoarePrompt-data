Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is at least 1.
   - `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by volume.
   - `dp` is a list of `n` elements each initialized to `0.0`.
   - `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`.
   - `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`.
   - `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` holds true.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
   - For each `j`, it updates `dp[i]` if the condition `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` holds true.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was at least 1. Now, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i = i + 1`).
   - The loop will now iterate over `j` from 0 to `i-1` (which is now `i-1`).

4. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`, making it at least 2 (since `i` was at least 1 initially).
   - `dp` remains the same as it was updated based on the previous `i` and the loop will continue updating it for the new `i`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `i` will be `i + 1`, which means `i` is at least 2.
- The list `cakes` remains the same.
- The list `dp` remains the same as it was updated for the previous `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is at least 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of `n` elements each initialized to `0.0`, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is `cakes[1][0]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` holds true.**
