Output State: **`dp[i]` is the maximum value among all `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `j < i` and `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains `cakes[i][0]`.**

Explanation:
- After each iteration of the loop, `dp[i]` is updated if there exists a `j < i` such that `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. This ensures that `dp[i]` contains the maximum possible value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` under the given conditions.
- If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains unchanged and retains its initial value `cakes[i][0]`.
- This process continues until the loop completes all iterations, ensuring that `dp[i]` reflects the correct maximum value based on the specified conditions.
