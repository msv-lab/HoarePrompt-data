Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` holds true for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, and the rest of the elements in `dp` follow the updated rule.**
