#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, and the length of this list is a positive integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100 000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the volume of a cake calculated as \(\pi * r^2 * h\), the radius \(r\) of the cake, and the height \(h\) of the cake, and `r` and `h` are integers input by the user.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each `dp[i]` is the maximum volume of a cake that can be added to the previous cake without violating the height and radius constraints, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake. It processes this list to calculate the maximum volume of a subset of cakes that can be stacked together without violating the height and radius constraints. Specifically, it ensures that no two adjacent cakes in the stack have the same or larger radius and height. The function sorts the cakes by their volume in descending order and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum volume that can be achieved under these constraints. Finally, it prints the maximum volume that can be obtained. If the input list is empty or any tuple does not contain exactly two positive integers, the function raises an error.
