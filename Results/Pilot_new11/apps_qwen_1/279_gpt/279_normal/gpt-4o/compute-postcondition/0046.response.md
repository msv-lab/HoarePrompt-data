The code assigns the value of `i` to `x`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `x` will also be 2. The values of `n`, `not visited[2]`, and `cycle` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `not visited[2]` is true, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 2**
