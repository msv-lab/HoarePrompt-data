`cycle` is assigned the value of `x`. Given that `x` is 2, `cycle` will be a list containing the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `not visited[2]` must be false, `cycle` is `[2]`, `x` is 2, `visited[2]` is True.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `not visited[2]` must be false, `cycle` is `[2]`, `x` is 2, `visited[2]` is True**
