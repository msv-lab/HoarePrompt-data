The code `x = p[x] - 1` updates the value of `x` by subtracting 1 from the value of `p[x]`. Given the initial state where `cycle` is `[1, 0, x]` and `x` must be a value such that `visited[x]` is `True` and `visited[0]` is `True`, we know that `x` is part of the cycle and `visited[x]` is `True`.

Since `x` is part of the cycle and `visited[x]` is `True`, we do not have the exact value of `p[x]` initially, but we know that `p[x]` must be one of the elements in the cycle `[1, 0, x]`. However, the exact value of `p[x]` does not affect the final output since we only care about the updated value of `x`.

Let's assume the simplest case where `p[x]` is 1 (since 1 is part of the cycle and `x` cannot be 0 or 1 because `x` must be such that `visited[x]` is `True` and `x` cannot be 0 as it would create a contradiction with the cycle definition). In this case:

- If `p[x]` is 1, then `x` becomes `1 - 1 = 0`. However, since `x` must be a value such that `visited[x]` is `True` and `x` cannot be 0, this assumption might not hold.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, let's assume `p[x]` is 0 (which is also part of the cycle):

- If `p[x]` is 0, then `x` becomes `0 - 1 = -1`. But since the value of `x` must be within the range defined by the problem and considering the nature of cycles and visited elements, we can conclude that `x` remains within the context of the cycle.

Therefore, the updated value of `x` is the result of the operation, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `cycle` is [1, 0, x], `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
