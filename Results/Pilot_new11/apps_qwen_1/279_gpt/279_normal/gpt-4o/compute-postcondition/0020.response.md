The code sets `visited[x]` to `True`. From the initial state, we know that `visited[0]` is `True`, `cycle` is `[0, p[0] - 1]`, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `visited[x]` is `False`. Since `x` is set to `True`, the new state of `visited[x]` will be `True`.

Output State: **`visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is [0, p[0] - 1], `x` is p[p[0] - 1] - 1, and `visited[x]` is True**
