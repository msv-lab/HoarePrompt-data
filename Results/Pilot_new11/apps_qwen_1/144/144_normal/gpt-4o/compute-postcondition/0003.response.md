The code initializes the variable `mex` to 1. The variable `a` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it. The initial value of `n` is preserved. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `mex` to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `mex` is 1**
