The code calculates `full_cycle_length` based on the values of `n` and `m`. If `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` is assigned the value `(2 * n - 2) * m`, otherwise, it is assigned the value `m`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

So, `n` is still a positive integer input, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, `x` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1.

The value of `full_cycle_length` depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`. If `n` is 1, `full_cycle_length` is `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, `x` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` > 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`.**
