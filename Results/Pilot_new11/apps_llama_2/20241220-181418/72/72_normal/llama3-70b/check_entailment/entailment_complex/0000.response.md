Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum and minimum number of questions that can be asked, and the number of questions Sergei is asked.

The problem description states that the teacher asks pupils in a specific order, first from the first row to the last row, and then from the last row to the first row, repeating this cycle. This means that the number of questions asked to each pupil depends on the position of the pupil in the row and the number of rows.

However, the program calculates `max_asked` and `min_asked` without considering the position of the pupil in the row. It simply calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions based on the total number of questions asked (`k`) and the number of rows (`n`). This is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that pupils in different rows may be asked a different number of questions.

Furthermore, the program calculates `sergei_asked` using the formula `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`, which is also incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the position of Sergei in the row and the number of questions asked to him.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `m = 4`, `k = 12`, `x = 2`, and `y = 3`. The correct calculation for `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` would involve simulating the teacher's questioning process and counting the number of questions asked to each pupil. However, the program would produce incorrect results using its current formulas.

To fix this, the program would need to be modified to correctly simulate the teacher's questioning process and calculate the number of questions asked to each pupil based on their position in the row and the number of rows. This would involve using a more complex algorithm that takes into account the specific rules of the questioning process described in the problem statement.
