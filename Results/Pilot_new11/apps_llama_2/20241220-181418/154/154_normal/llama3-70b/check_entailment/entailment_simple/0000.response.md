Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described. The main issue is that it does not take into account the number of tasks (`n`) and the fact that each task consists of `k` subtasks. The current implementation only considers the time required to solve subtasks, but it does not consider the number of tasks and the fact that each task can be partially solved.

The dynamic programming approach used in the program is also incorrect. It only considers the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the given time `M`, but it does not consider the fact that each task can be partially solved and that solving all subtasks of a task earns an extra point.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a different approach that takes into account the number of tasks, the number of subtasks, and the time required to solve each subtask. We need to find the optimal way to allocate the time `M` among the tasks and subtasks to maximize the total number of points earned.

One possible approach is to use a dynamic programming algorithm with three dimensions: `n` (number of tasks), `k` (number of subtasks), and `M` (time). The algorithm would iterate over all possible ways to allocate the time `M` among the tasks and subtasks, and it would keep track of the maximum number of points earned for each possible allocation.

Here is a high-level outline of a correct algorithm:

1. Initialize a 3D array `dp` with dimensions `n+1`, `k+1`, and `M+1`, where `dp[n][k][M]` represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by solving `n` tasks, each with `k` subtasks, within the time `M`.
2. Iterate over all possible values of `n`, `k`, and `M`.
3. For each `n`, `k`, and `M`, iterate over all possible ways to allocate the time `M` among the tasks and subtasks.
4. For each allocation, calculate the number of points earned by solving the corresponding tasks and subtasks.
5. Update the `dp` array with the maximum number of points earned for each possible allocation.
6. The final answer is stored in `dp[n][k][M]`.

This approach correctly takes into account the number of tasks, the number of subtasks, and the time required to solve each subtask, and it finds the optimal way to allocate the time `M` among the tasks and subtasks to maximize the total number of points earned.
