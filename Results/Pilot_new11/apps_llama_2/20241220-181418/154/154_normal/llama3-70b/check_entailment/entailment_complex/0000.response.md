Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1.  The problem statement mentions that Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order and that the number of points for a task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it, with an extra point if the task is completely solved. However, the program does not consider this aspect of the problem correctly.
2.  The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M without exceeding it. However, the final calculation of the maximum points that Polycarp can earn is incorrect. The program calculates the sum of the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M, plus the count of types where the maximum number of items equals the type number. This does not accurately represent the points earned by Polycarp.
3.  The problem statement also mentions that Polycarp has M minutes of time and that the time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. However, the program does not consider this aspect of the problem correctly. It does not take into account the time required to solve each subtask and the limited time available to Polycarp.
4.  The program also does not consider the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks. It only considers the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M, without considering the actual tasks and subtasks.

A correct solution would involve considering the time required to solve each subtask, the limited time available to Polycarp, and the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks. The solution would need to calculate the maximum points that Polycarp can earn by solving the optimal combination of subtasks from the available tasks, taking into account the time required to solve each subtask and the limited time available.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

*   Input: n = 3, k = 4, M = 11, t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
*   Expected output: 6 (Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes, and then solve one subtask of the second task in 1 minute)
*   Actual output: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum points that Polycarp can earn in this case, as it does not consider the time required to solve each subtask and the limited time available to Polycarp.

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and a correct solution would require a different approach that takes into account the time required to solve each subtask, the limited time available to Polycarp, and the fact that Polycarp can solve subtasks from different tasks.
