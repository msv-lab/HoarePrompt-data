Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where initially `dp[2][1]` = `dp[2][0]`, `i` is 2, the current value of `j` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, which is `t[1]`.**
