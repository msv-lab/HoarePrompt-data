The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are updated based on the input. The input is split into three integers, which are assigned to `n`, `k`, and `M`, respectively. The constraints on the input values are not explicitly checked, but the problem statement implies that the input values should satisfy the conditions 1 <= n <= 45, 1 <= k <= 45, and 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9. The values of `t_j` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, and `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k**
