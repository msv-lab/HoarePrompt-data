`dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`, where `i` is 3 and `j` is 1. This means the value of `dp[3][1]` is updated to be equal to `dp[3][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 3 and 3 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9 and `M` must be greater than 0, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[3][1]` equals `dp[3][0]` and `dp[i][j]` for other `i` and `j` remains the same, `i` is 3, `j` is 1.
