The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. The value of `i` is 3, and the value of `j` is 1, which is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, 
`k` is still an input integer such that `k` is at least 3 and 3 <= `k` <= 45, 
`M` is still an input integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9 and `M` must be greater than 0, 
`t_j` are still integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, 
`t` is still a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, 
`dp` is still a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) but `dp[3][1]` is now equal to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1` (which is `dp[2][0] + 1` since `t[2]` equals `t_2` and `t_2` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` equals 1), 
`i` is still 3, 
the current value of `j` is still 1, 
and the current value of `j` is still greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 3 and 3 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9 and `M` must be greater than 0, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[3][1]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2][0] + 1`, `i` is 3, the current value of `j` is 1, and the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`.**
