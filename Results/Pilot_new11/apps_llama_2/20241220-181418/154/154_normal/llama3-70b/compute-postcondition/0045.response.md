The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. The current value of `i` is 3 and the current value of `j` is 3. So, `dp[3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[3][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 3 and 3 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9 and `M` must be greater than 3, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, and `dp[3][3]` is equal to `dp[3][2]`.
