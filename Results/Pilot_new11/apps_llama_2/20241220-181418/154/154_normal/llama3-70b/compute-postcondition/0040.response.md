According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `M`. If `j` is less than `M`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 3 and 3 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9 and `M` must be greater than 0, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[3][1]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2][0] + 1`, `i` is 3, and the current value of `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2.
