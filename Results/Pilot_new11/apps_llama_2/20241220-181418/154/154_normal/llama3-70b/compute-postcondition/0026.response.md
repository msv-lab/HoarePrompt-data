The given code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp` at index `[i][j]` to be the same as the value at index `[i][j - 1]`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, 
- `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, 
- `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, 
- `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, 
- `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, 
- `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where if `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`, then `dp[2][1]` = max(`dp[2][1]`, `dp[1][1 - t[1]]` + 1), 
- `i` is 2, and the current value of `j` is 2

The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` implies that `dp[2][2]` becomes equal to `dp[2][1]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[2][2]` = `dp[2][1]`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `j` is 2**
