The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2 and the current value of `j` is 3, this means `dp[2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9 and `M` is at least 3, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[2][3]` = `dp[2][2]`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `j` is 3**
