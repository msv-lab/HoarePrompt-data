The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

The impact of the code on the program is that it updates the value of `dp[i][j]` in the 2D list `dp`. 

The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` plus 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

The value of `n` remains an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45.
The value of `k` remains an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45.
The value of `M` remains an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9.
The values of `t_j` remain integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k.
The value of `t` remains a sorted list of input integers in ascending order.
The value of `i` remains 1.
The value of `j` remains greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to the value of `t` at index `i - 1`**.
