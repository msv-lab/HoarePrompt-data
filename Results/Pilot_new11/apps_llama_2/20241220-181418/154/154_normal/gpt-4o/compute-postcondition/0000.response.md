The value of `total_time_per_task` is assigned the sum of all elements in list `t`. The sum of the elements in `t` can be at most `k * 1000000` and at least `k`, because `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `1 <= k <= 45`. 

Output State: **n is an integer and 1 <= n <= 45, k is an integer and 1 <= k <= 45, M is an integer and 0 <= M <= 2*10^9, t is a list of k integers where 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for all j, and total_time_per_task is an integer and k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000**
