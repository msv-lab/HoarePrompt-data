According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `t`. If the list `t` has at least 1 subtask time, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= k <= 45`, so for the loop to be executed, `t` must have at least 1 subtask time and `subtask_time` is the first subtask time in the list `t`, and the index of `subtask_time` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is `0`, `subtask_time` is the first subtask time in the list `t`, index of `subtask_time` is 0**
