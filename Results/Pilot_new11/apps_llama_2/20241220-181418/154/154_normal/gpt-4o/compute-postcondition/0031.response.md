The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, `remaining_time` is the remainder of the original `remaining_time` divided by the greatest common divisor of all subtask times in the list `t`, or 0 if all remaining time is used, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)` plus the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
