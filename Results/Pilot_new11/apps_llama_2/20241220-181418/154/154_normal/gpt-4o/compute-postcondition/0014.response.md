The given code `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` reduces the `remaining_time` by the product of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time`. 

Given that `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, the new `remaining_time` will be `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`. 

Since `remaining_time // subtask_time` is the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`, the expression `(remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time` represents the largest multiple of `subtask_time` that is less than or equal to `remaining_time`. Therefore, the new `remaining_time` will be the remainder of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtask_time` is the first subtask time in the list `t`, `remaining_time` is the remainder of the old `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the new `remaining_time // subtask_time` which will be less than the old `max_subtasks_for_this_task` because the new `remaining_time` is less than the old `remaining_time` and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is an integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is the new `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtask_time` is the first subtask time in the list `t`, `remaining_time` is the remainder of the old `M - time_used` divided by `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is the new `remaining_time // subtask_time`**
