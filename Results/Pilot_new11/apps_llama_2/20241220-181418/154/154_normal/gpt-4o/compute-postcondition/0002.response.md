According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Given that `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, it is already ensured that `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we need to consider the state of `complete_tasks`. Since the loop iterates over `range(n + 1)`, `complete_tasks` will take values from 0 to `n`. 

So, for the loop to execute, `n` must be within its given range, and `complete_tasks` should start from 0.
State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `max_points` is an integer and equals `0`, `complete_tasks` is an integer and starts at 0**
