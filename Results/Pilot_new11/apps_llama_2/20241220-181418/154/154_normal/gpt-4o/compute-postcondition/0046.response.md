Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 elements, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the second element in `t`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time` and `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.***
