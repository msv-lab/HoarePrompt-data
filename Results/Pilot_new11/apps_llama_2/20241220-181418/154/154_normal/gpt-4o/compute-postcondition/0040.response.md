To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables. The code provided is:

```python
remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
```

Given the initial state, the variables affected by this operation are `remaining_time` and potentially `max_subtasks_for_this_task` if its calculation depends on `remaining_time`. However, from the given initial state, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[0]`, which does not directly depend on `remaining_time` but rather on `M`, `complete_tasks`, `total_time_per_task`, and `t[0]`.

The variable `remaining_time` is initially `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. After the operation, it becomes:

```python
remaining_time = (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
```

Substituting `max_subtasks_for_this_task` with its initial value expression gives:

```python
remaining_time = (M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[0]) * subtask_time
```

However, without the specific value of `subtask_time`, we cannot simplify this expression further. Nonetheless, we can express the new state of `remaining_time` in terms of the given variables and constants.

The other variables' states are not directly affected by this operation, so their values remain as initially described.

Therefore, considering all the initial conditions and the changes made by the code, the output state is:

- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 element
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `subtasks_solved` is the original value of `subtasks_solved` plus `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[0]`
- `remaining_time` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) - ((M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[0]) * subtask_time`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)` plus the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`
- `complete_tasks` remains increased by 1 if `time_used` is less than or equal to `M`
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // t[0]`
