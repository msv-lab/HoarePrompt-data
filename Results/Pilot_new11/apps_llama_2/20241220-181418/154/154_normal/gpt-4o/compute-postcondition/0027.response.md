The value of `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the product of `(n - complete_tasks)` and `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is the remainder of the original `remaining_time` divided by the greatest common divisor of all subtask times in the list `t`, or 0 if all remaining time is used.
