The value of `points` is calculated as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `total_time_per_task`, and the relationship between `time_used`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks` remains the same. The new variable `points` is introduced with its calculated value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, if `time_used` is greater than `M`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement with `max_points` as `0`, `complete_tasks` as `0`, and the given `time_used`. Otherwise, the execution continues with the given `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, and `time_used`.**
