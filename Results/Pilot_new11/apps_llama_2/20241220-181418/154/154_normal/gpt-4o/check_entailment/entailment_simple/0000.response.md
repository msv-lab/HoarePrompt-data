Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The main issue with the program is that it doesn't consider the optimal order of solving subtasks. It first tries to solve complete tasks and then uses the remaining time to solve as many subtasks as possible. However, this approach doesn't guarantee the maximum number of points.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `k = 4`, `M = 11`, and `t = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program will first try to solve one complete task (using 10 minutes), and then it will try to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining 1 minute. This will result in a total of 6 points.

However, a more optimal approach would be to solve the first subtask of all three tasks (using 3 minutes), and then use the remaining 8 minutes to solve the second and third subtasks of two tasks (using 5 minutes). This will result in a total of 7 points.

To fix this issue, the program needs to consider the optimal order of solving subtasks. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum number of points that can be earned for each possible time.

Here is a high-level idea of how the corrected program could work:

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(M + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points that can be earned using `i` minutes and `j` tasks.

2. Iterate over all possible times `t` from 1 to `M`, and for each time `t`, iterate over all possible tasks `j` from 1 to `n`.

3. For each cell `dp[t][j]`, calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned by either solving a complete task, solving a subtask, or not solving any task.

4. The final answer will be stored in the cell `dp[M][n]`.

This approach ensures that the program considers all possible ways of solving tasks and subtasks, and it will always return the maximum number of points that can be earned.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(M + 1)]

    for i in range(1, M + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            for l in range(1, k + 1):
                if i >= t[l - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - t[l - 1]][j] + 1)
            if i >= sum(t):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - sum(t)][j - 1] + k + 1)

    return dp[M][n]

print(func_1(n, k, M, t))
