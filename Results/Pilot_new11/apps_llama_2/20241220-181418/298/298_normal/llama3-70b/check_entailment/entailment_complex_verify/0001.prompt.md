You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    else:
        (x, y) = func_2(b, a % b)
        return (y, x - a // b * y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y) = func_2(a, b)
    return (x, y, x * a + y * b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not seem to directly address the problem description. It defines three functions, `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, which appear to be related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and potentially solving linear Diophantine equations. However, the program does not contain any logic that explicitly attempts to find three integer points that satisfy the condition of forming a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly is when the inputs are the same as the first example in the problem description: $n = 4$, $m = 3$, and $k = 3$. The program does not output "YES" followed by the coordinates of three points that form a triangle with an area of $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$, as required by the problem description. Instead, it does not provide any relevant output because it does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to be significantly modified or extended to find suitable points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ that satisfy the given constraints and the area requirement. The current implementation does not demonstrate an attempt to solve the specific geometric problem presented.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b`, not the absolute value of the original `a` as stated in the annotations. The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD, which is an integer. The state of the program after it concludes is that it has computed and returned the GCD of the input integers, with no modifications to the input variables `a` and `b` outside of the function scope. The function handles cases where `b` is 0 by returning `a`, which is a valid GCD operation. There is a discrepancy between the annotations and the actual code behavior, where the annotations incorrectly state that the function returns the absolute value of the original `a`, whereas the code actually computes and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0, where 0 is the current value of b
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns two values: `y`, which is a value returned by `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the result of the expression `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is also a return value from `func_2(b, a % b)`, `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `y` is as described.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean algorithm, providing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. The function takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple of two values: either `(1, 0)` when `b` equals `0`, indicating that the GCD is `a` (or `b` when `a` is `0`), or the results of recursive calculations involving integer division and modulo operations for other cases. The function handles edge cases where either `a` or `b` is `0`, returning the non-zero value as the GCD and the corresponding coefficient. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it provides the coefficients `x` and `y` for the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, effectively giving the GCD and its representation as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns x and y, which are the returned values from func_2(a, b), and the result of the expression x * a + y * b, where x, y, a, and b are of unknown specific values, but a and b are integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. Here, `x` and `y` are the returned values from the function `func_2(a, b)`, which is called within this function. The specific values of `x` and `y` depend on the implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, which is not provided in the given code. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` and `b`. It only uses them to compute and return the specified values. Note that the function's behavior is dependent on the implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, which might introduce additional edge cases or effects not directly apparent from the given code.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
