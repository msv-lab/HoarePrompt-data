The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not use the implemented functions to find the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle. However, the annotated version of the code reveals that the functions are indeed used to find the points, and the program checks if the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to (n*m)/k.

Upon reviewing the annotated version, we can see that the program uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD of n and m, and then checks if the area of the triangle formed by the points (0, 0), (0, n1*m//g), and (m1*m//g, 0) is equal to (n*m)/k.

The program's logic seems to be correct. It first checks if (n*m) is divisible by k, and if not, it prints "NO". If (n*m) is divisible by k, it calculates the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle and prints "YES" along with the points.

However, there are some potential issues with the program. For example, the program assumes that the input values are valid and does not handle edge cases. Additionally, the program's use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the points may not be the most efficient or straightforward approach.

Despite these potential issues, the program's core logic appears to be correct, and it seems to solve the problem as described. Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is not entirely accurate.

The reason why I think the original assessment is not accurate is that it did not take into account the fact that the program actually uses the implemented functions to find the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle. The annotated version provides a clearer understanding of the program's logic and reveals that the program is indeed attempting to solve the problem as described.

Therefore, based on the annotated version and the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
