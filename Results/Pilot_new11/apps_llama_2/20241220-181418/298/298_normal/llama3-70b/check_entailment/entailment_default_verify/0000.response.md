The original assessment claims that the program does not correctly solve the problem. Upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the original assessment is accurate.

The code defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, `func_2` implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, and `func_3` uses the results from `func_2` to calculate three values.

However, the provided code does not directly address the problem of finding three points that form a triangle with an area equal to `(n*m)/k`. The functions defined in the code do not seem to be used to calculate the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle.

The output hints for `func_3` describe its behavior but do not provide any insight into how the function is used to solve the problem. The hints only describe the internal workings of the function, which does not directly relate to the problem at hand.

In contrast, the example of a correct program provided in the original assessment demonstrates a clear approach to solving the problem. It checks if `(n*m)/k` is an integer and then finds three points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle.

Based on the provided code and the output hints, there is no clear indication that the program uses the defined functions to calculate the points that form a triangle with the desired area.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Final: **False**
