To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the Python code snippet. The initial state is as follows: `a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, and `x` and `y` are assigned values returned by `func_2(b, a % b)`. 

However, without knowing the specifics of `func_2(b, a % b)`, we can only describe the nature of `x` and `y` as being the return values of this function, which takes two parameters: `b` (a non-zero integer) and `a % b` (the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which will also be an integer).

Given the return statement `return y, x - a // b * y`, we are returning two values:
1. `y`: This is one of the return values from `func_2(b, a % b)`. Without specifics of `func_2`, we know `y` is a value determined by the function `func_2` based on `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
2. `x - a // b * y`: This expression involves `x` (the other return value from `func_2`), `a // b` (integer division of `a` by `b`, which will be an integer since `a` is an integer and `b` is a non-zero integer), and `y`. The expression calculates the value of `x` minus the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `y`.

Output State: **The program returns two values: `y`, which is a value returned by `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the result of the expression `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is also a return value from `func_2(b, a % b)`, `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `y` is as described.**
