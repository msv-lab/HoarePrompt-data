Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the area `n * m / k` is an integer. If it's not, it prints 'NO' because the area of the triangle must be an integer.

2. If the area is an integer, the program checks if the area is 0. If it is, it prints 'NO' because the area of the triangle cannot be 0.

3. If the area is not 0, the program prints 'YES' and '0 0', which is one point of the triangle.

4. Then, the program tries to find two other points that form a triangle with the area equal to `n * m / k`.

5. The program uses the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = (base * height) / 2`. It tries to set the base to `2 * area` and the height to 1, which gives an area of `2 * area / 2 = area`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `2 * area` and 1, and 0 and 1, which are two points that form a triangle with the area equal to `n * m / k`.

6. If `2 * area` is larger than `n` but less than or equal to `m`, it prints 1 and `2 * area`, and 1 and 0, which are two points that form a triangle with the area equal to `n * m / k`.

7. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, it prints `n` and `m // 2`, and 0 and `m // 2`, which are two points that form a triangle with the area equal to `n * m / k`.

The program correctly handles all cases where the area is an integer and not 0, and it prints 'YES' and the coordinates of the three points that form a triangle with the area equal to `n * m / k`. If the area is not an integer or is 0, it prints 'NO'.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
