Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not work correctly in all cases. For example, when the area is a non-zero integer and 2 * area is larger than both n and m, the function prints 'n m // 2' and '0 m // 2' as the additional coordinates. However, this may not always form a triangle with the correct area, because the choice of coordinates depends only on n and m, and not on the value of the area.

Another issue is that the function assumes that the height of the triangle will always be 1, which is not necessarily true. If the area is large and n is small, then the height of the triangle will need to be larger than 1. The function does not handle this case correctly.

For instance, consider the input where n = 5, m = 6, and k = 2. In this case, the area is 15, and 2 * area is 30, which is larger than both n and m. However, the function will print '5 3' and '0 3', which does not form a triangle with the correct area.

The function seems to be trying to solve the problem by choosing coordinates that would form a triangle with the correct base and height. However, it does not consider all possible cases, and its logic is flawed. It needs to be revised to handle all possible cases correctly.
