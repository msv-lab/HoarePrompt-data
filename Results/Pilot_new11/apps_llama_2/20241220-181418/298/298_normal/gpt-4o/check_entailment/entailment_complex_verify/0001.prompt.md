You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program attempts to find three integer points that form a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$. However, there are cases where the program does not work correctly.

One such case is when $n = 5$, $m = 4$, and $k = 2$. The area of the triangle should be $\frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10$. However, the program will print:

```
YES
0 0
20 1
0 1
```

This is incorrect because the point $(20, 1)$ has an x-coordinate greater than $n = 5$, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle cases where $2 \cdot area > n$ and $2 \cdot area > m$. The program should find alternative points that satisfy the area requirement and the constraints on $x$ and $y$ coordinates.

The program provided does not handle all possible cases and edge cases, and therefore, it is considered incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, and 2 * `area` is larger than `n`. If 2 * `area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 {2 * `area`}' has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. Otherwise, '0 ' and `m // 2` have been printed, and `n` and `m // 2` have been printed.

If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` and `1` have been printed, and '0 1' has been printed. Otherwise, `2 * area` is larger than `n`. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 {2 * `area`}' has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. Otherwise, '0 ' and `m // 2` have been printed, and `n` and `m // 2` have been printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`. If `area` is 0, 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is not 0, 'YES' and '0 0' have been printed. Additionally, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` and `1` have been printed, and '0 1' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than `n` but less than or equal to `m`, then '1 {2 * `area`}' has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, then '0 ' and `m // 2` have been printed, and `n` and `m // 2` have been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`. If `area` is not an integer, 'NO' has been printed to the console. If `area` is an integer, then 'NO' has been printed if `area` is 0. If `area` is not 0, 'YES' and '0 0' have been printed. Additionally, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then `2 * area` and `1` have been printed, and '0 1' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than `n` but less than or equal to `m`, then '1 {2 * `area`}' has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, then '0 ' and `m // 2` have been printed, and `n` and `m // 2` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three integer inputs (n, m, k) from the user, which are expected to be within specific ranges (1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9), and determines whether the area calculated as n * m / k is an integer and not equal to 0. If the area is not an integer or is 0, the function prints 'NO'. If the area is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by additional coordinates based on the comparison of 2 * area with n and m. Specifically, it prints either '2 * area 1' and '0 1' if 2 * area is less than or equal to n, '1 2 * area' and '1 0' if 2 * area is larger than n but less than or equal to m, or 'n m // 2' and '0 m // 2' if 2 * area exceeds both n and m. The function's intended purpose seems to be related to geometric or spatial calculations, possibly involving rectangular areas divided into smaller sections, but its exact application or significance cannot be determined without further context.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
