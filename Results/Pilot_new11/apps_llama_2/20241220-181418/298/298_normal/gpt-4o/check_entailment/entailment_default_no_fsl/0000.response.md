Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly for every potential case. The problem description asks to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$, where $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$. 

However, the code does not always find such points. For example, if we input `5 5 2`, the code calculates the area as `12.5`, which is not an integer, so it prints `NO`. But, it's possible to form a triangle with area `12.5` if we allow the points to be at the boundary of the rectangle.

Another example is when we input `3 3 2`. The area is `4.5`, which is not an integer, so the code prints `NO`. But, the problem description does not explicitly state that the area must be an integer, it's just that the program should find three integer points that form a triangle with the given area. 

The provided code only checks if the area is an integer and then tries to find points based on certain conditions, but it does not handle all possible cases. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
