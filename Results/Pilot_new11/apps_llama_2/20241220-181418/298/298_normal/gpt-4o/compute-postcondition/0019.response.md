The given code prints the value of `n` and the integer division of `m` by 2. This operation does not change the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `area`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The printed values are `n` and `m // 2`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, and 2 * `area` is larger than `n`, and 2 * `area` is larger than `m`, and `n` and `m // 2` have been printed**
