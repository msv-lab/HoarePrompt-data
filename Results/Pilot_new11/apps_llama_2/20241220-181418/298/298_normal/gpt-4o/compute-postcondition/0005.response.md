The code converts the `area` to an integer using the `int()` function. Since `area` is already an integer (given that `n * m / k` is a whole number), this operation does not change the value of `area`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`.**
