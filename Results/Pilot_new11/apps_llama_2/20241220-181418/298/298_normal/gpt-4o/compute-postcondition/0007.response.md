The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console, but it does not modify any variables. The states of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k` and its current value is 0, and 'NO' has been printed**
