The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters `n`, `m`, or `k` in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that these parameters should be considered in the function's functionality description. Given the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 10^9 and 2 <= `k` <= 10^9, and without specific output details, we can infer the function is designed to operate within these bounds.


However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`) and there are no specified output conditions (like in the previous examples), we cannot accurately describe the return value based on the given constraints without assuming the function's purpose or how it utilizes `n`, `m`, and `k`. Thus, under normal circumstances, we would describe the function's functionality based on its parameter list and return values as specified in the problem statement.


Given the information provided and adhering strictly to the format requested, but acknowledging the function definition does not match the constraints provided:


Functionality: **The function should ideally accept parameters n, m, and k, which are integers within specific ranges (1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9), but as defined, it does not accept any parameters, making its intended functionality based on n, m, and k unclear.**
