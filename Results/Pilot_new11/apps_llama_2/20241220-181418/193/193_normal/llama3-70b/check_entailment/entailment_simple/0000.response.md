Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. The problem statement requires finding the minimum number of seconds (i.e., operations) needed to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y` by changing one side at a time, ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate at each step.

The program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `abs(x - y)`, which does not correctly represent the minimum number of operations required to achieve the transformation.

For example, consider the input `6 3`. The program would output `3`, but the correct minimum number of operations is `4`, as shown in the problem description: `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`.

This discrepancy arises because the program does not consider the constraints and intermediate steps required to maintain a non-degenerate triangle during the transformation process. It simply calculates a direct difference, which is not equivalent to the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the desired transformation.

To correctly solve this problem, a more complex approach would be needed, potentially involving a breadth-first search (BFS) or dynamic programming strategy to explore the possible state transitions and identify the minimum number of operations required to reach the target state.
