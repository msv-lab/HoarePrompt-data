Correctness: **False**

The provided code calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers `x` and `y` and prints the result. However, this does not accurately solve the problem as described. The problem is asking for the minimum number of seconds (or operations) required to transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` into one with side length `y` by modifying one side at a time, ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate.

A key insight from the problem examples is that to achieve an equilateral triangle of side length `y` from one of side length `x`, Memory can perform a series of operations on the sides of the triangle, but the simplest approach to finding the minimum number of operations is not directly related to the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. 

For instance, given the input (6, 3), the code will output `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, which does not match the expected minimum number of operations (4) as shown in the problem example: `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`. This indicates the code does not accurately solve the problem for every potential case.

Therefore, the code is incorrect. It fails to account for the specific operations (changing one side at a time while maintaining a non-degenerate triangle) and directly returns the absolute difference, which does not represent the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired equilateral triangle side length transformation.
