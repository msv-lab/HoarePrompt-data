Precondition: **The input includes several parameters: the number of sofas (d) which is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, the size of the storehouse (n, m) which are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, the coordinates of the sofas (x1, y1, x2, y2) which are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n and m respectively, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom (cntl, cntr, cntt, cntb) which are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to d - 1. All sofas are distinct, no cell is covered by more than one sofa, and cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) have a common side and are not equal.**
