The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 1, the value of `left_count[1]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The initial value of `left_count[1]` is the number of sofas to the right of the corresponding sofa. Considering the condition that if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[1]` is the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index 1 plus 1, but this condition is not met since `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`. Therefore, `left_count[1]` is initially the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index 1.

The value of `d` is still an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is still an input integer, `m` is still an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are still the coordinates of the sofa at index 1 in the `sofas` list, `cntl` is still the first input integer, `cntr` is still the second input integer, `cntt` is still the third input integer, `cntb` is still the fourth input integer, `sofas` is still a list of `d` tuple elements. 

`i` is still 1 and `j` is still 0. `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are still the coordinates of the sofa at index `j` in the `sofas` list. `top_count` is still a list where each element is the number of sofas below the corresponding sofa, `bottom_count` is still a list where each element is the number of sofas above the corresponding sofa, `right_count` is still a list where each element is the number of sofas to the left of the corresponding sofa.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index 1 in the `sofas` list, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j` in the `sofas` list, `left_count` is a list where `left_count[1]` is the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index 1 plus 1 and `left_count[k]` for k not equal to 1 is the number of sofas to the right of the corresponding sofa, `top_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas below the corresponding sofa, `bottom_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas above the corresponding sofa, `right_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the left of the corresponding sofa**
