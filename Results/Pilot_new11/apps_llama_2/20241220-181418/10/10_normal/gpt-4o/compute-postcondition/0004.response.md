The given code line takes four space-separated integer inputs and assigns them to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` respectively. 

The initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are updated to the input values, which, according to the problem, should be integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n` and `m` respectively.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `y1` is an input integer between 1 and `m`, `x2` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `y2` is an input integer between 1 and `m`, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, `sofas` is an empty list**
