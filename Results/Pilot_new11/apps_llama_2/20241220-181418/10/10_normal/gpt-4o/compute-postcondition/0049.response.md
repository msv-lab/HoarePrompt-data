To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. 

Given the for loop statement `for j in range(d):`, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `d`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The loop will execute again if `j` (which is now 2) is less than `d`. Therefore, `d` must be greater than 2.

State: **`d` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the first input, `y1` is the second coordinate of the first input, `x2` is the third coordinate of the first input, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the first input, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple element, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first coordinate of the second input, `y1_j` is the second coordinate of the second input, `x2_j` is the third coordinate of the second input, `y2_j` is the fourth coordinate of the second input**
