Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `y1` is the second element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `x2` is the third element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `y2` is the fourth element of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `j` is the next index in the sofas list. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is `bottom_count[i] + 1`. Additionally, if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `i` equals `j`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the program executes the next line of code.**
