The value of `d` is updated to be the integer value of the input. The states of the other variables are not affected. The input includes several parameters: the number of sofas (`d`) which is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, the size of the storehouse (`n`, `m`) which are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, the coordinates of the sofas (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) which are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n` and `m` respectively, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom (`cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb`) which are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1. All sofas are distinct, no cell is covered by more than one sofa, and cells (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) have a common side and are not equal.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n` and `m` respectively, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, and all the given constraints about the sofas and cells are still valid**
