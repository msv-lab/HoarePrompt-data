The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one. However, in this case, since there's no loop provided in the code snippet, the `continue` statement has no direct impact on the variables. 

The values of the variables do not change because `continue` does not modify any variables; it only controls the flow of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `j` is at most `d`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j` in the `sofas` list, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j+1` in the `sofas` list, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.
