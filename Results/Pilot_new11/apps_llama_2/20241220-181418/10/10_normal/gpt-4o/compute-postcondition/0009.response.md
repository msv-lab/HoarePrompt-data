According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If the loop has executed `d-1` times, it can execute one more time if the current iteration is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the variable '_' (which is the loop variable) is increased by 1. However, the variable '_' is not used in the state description, so we should consider the loop counter. Since we do not have the exact value of `d` and the loop counter is not explicitly mentioned, the loop can execute one more time if the current iteration is less than `d`. 

The loop counter is not explicitly stated, but let's assume it has incremented. So at the start of the next iteration, `_` would be the next integer, but since `_` is not used in the problem description, we need to consider what is used.

State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, `sofas` is a list containing two tuple elements: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
