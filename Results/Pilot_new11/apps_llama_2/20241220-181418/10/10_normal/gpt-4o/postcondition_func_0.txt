The function determines the position of a target sofa in a storehouse based on the provided sofa coordinates and the number of sofas in different directions. It accepts parameters related to the number of sofas, storehouse size, sofa coordinates, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom. The function iterates through the list of sofas, calculates the number of sofas in each direction for each sofa, and checks if these counts match the input counts. If a match is found, it returns the 1-indexed position of the target sofa. If no match is found, it returns -1. The function handles cases where there are multiple sofas with the same counts, but it only returns the position of the first matching sofa. It also handles edge cases where the input counts are not found among any of the sofas, returning -1 in such cases. The function assumes that the input is valid and does not perform any error checking on the input values.
