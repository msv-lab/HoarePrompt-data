The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is `n - 12`, and `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is `n - 12`, and `count` is increased by 1**
