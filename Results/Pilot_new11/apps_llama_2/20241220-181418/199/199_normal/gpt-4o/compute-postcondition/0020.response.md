To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is `n - 8`

Given code:
```python
rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
```

Now, let's substitute the values of `a` and `b` into the equation:
```python
rem = n - 2 * (3 + 3)
rem = n - 2 * 6
rem = n - 12
```

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 12, the value of `rem` will be `n - 12`.

The states of the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is `n - 12`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is `n - 12`**
