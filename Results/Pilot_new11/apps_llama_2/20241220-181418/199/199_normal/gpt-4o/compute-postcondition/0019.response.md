The value of `b` is updated to be equal to `a`. The previous value of `a` is 3, so `b` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is `n - 8`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 12, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, `rem` is `n - 8`**
