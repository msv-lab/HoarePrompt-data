To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given code and the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is as follows:
```python
for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
    b = a
    rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
    if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
        if a!= rem // 2:
            count += 1
```
From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can see that:

* `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
* `a` takes values from 1 to `n // 4`.
* `b` is always equal to `a`.
* `rem` is calculated as `n - 2 * (a + b)`.
* If `rem` is greater than 0 and even, and `a` is not equal to half of `rem`, then `count` is increased by 1.

After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `a` will be `n // 4`, and `b` will be equal to `a`. The value of `rem` will be `n - 2 * (n // 4 + n // 4)`, which simplifies to `n - n // 2`.

However, the key variable to focus on is `count`. The `count` variable is incremented whenever `rem` is greater than 0, even, and `a` is not equal to half of `rem`. This means that `count` will keep track of the number of times this condition is met for different values of `a`.

The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 6. If `n` is less than 6, the loop will not execute, and `count` will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `n` remains unchanged, `count` is the number of times the condition `rem > 0`, `rem` is even, and `a` is not equal to half of `rem` is met for different values of `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is the number of valid combinations where `n - 4a` is positive, even, and not equal to `2a`, for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`.**
