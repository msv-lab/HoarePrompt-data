Correctness: **False**

The given code is incorrect because it only considers the case when the two pairs of equal lengths are `a` and `a`, and `rem // 2` and `rem // 2`. However, the problem description states that the lengths of the four parts should be such that it's possible to form a rectangle, but not a square. This means that the two pairs of equal lengths can be any two distinct positive integers, not just `a` and `rem // 2`.

For example, when `n = 10`, the code will only consider the case `{2, 2, 3, 3}` and `{1, 1, 4, 4}`, but it will not consider the case `{4, 4, 1, 1}`, which is also a valid way to divide the stick. 

Moreover, the code is also not considering the cases when the sum of the lengths of `a` and `rem // 2` is equal to half of `n`. In these cases, the code should not count them because they form a square, not a rectangle. However, the code does not correctly handle these cases.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:
Input: 
10
Output:
1
Expected output:
2

The program does not handle this case correctly. The two possible ways to divide the stick are {1, 1, 4, 4} and {2, 2, 3, 3}. The program only counts one of them. 

In order to fix this issue, the code needs to be modified to consider all possible combinations of four parts that can form a rectangle, but not a square. The code should iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` such that `2a + 2b = n`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, and then count the number of such combinations. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
n = int(input())
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, (n - 2 * a) // 2 + 1):
            if 2 * a + 2 * b == n:
                count += 1
    return count
print(func_1(n))
```

This version of the code correctly handles all possible cases and outputs the correct number of ways to divide the stick.
