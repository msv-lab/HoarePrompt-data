According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. If `b` is less than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` is 4, and the condition `(n - a) // 2 + 1` must still be greater than `b`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, if `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then `ways` is increased by 1**
