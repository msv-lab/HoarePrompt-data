Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through all possible pairs of integers `a` and `b` where `a` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` and `b` ranges from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, counting the number of pairs where `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`. This corresponds to the requirement of splitting the stick into four parts with lengths `a`, `a`, `b`, and `b` such that it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square.

The code correctly handles both even and odd values of `n`. When `n` is even, it counts the number of distinct pairs of integers that satisfy the condition. When `n` is odd, no pairs will satisfy the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` because `a` and `b` are integers, so the code correctly returns 0 in this case.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, when `n = 6`, the code correctly returns 1, corresponding to the pair `a = 1` and `b = 2`. When `n = 20`, the code correctly returns 4, corresponding to the pairs `a = 1` and `b = 9`, `a = 2` and `b = 8`, `a = 3` and `b = 7`, and `a = 4` and `b = 6`. 

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
