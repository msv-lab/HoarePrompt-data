Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified and `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` possibly swapped based on `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `count` equals `sum(c * math.sqrt((mx - x)**2 + (my - y)**2))`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns a boolean value True. Otherwise, the program returns None.**
