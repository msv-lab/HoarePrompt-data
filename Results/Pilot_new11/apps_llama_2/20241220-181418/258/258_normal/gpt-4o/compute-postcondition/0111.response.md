Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `j` is 3, `x1` is `meats[3][0]`, `y1` is `meats[3][1]`, `c1` is `meats[3][2]`, `x2` is `meats[1][0]`, `y2` is `meats[1][1]`, `c2` is `meats[1][2]`, otherwise `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` retain their original values, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`, and if `d * d2 > d2`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged***
