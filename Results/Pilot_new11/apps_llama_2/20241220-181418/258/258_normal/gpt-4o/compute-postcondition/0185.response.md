Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns a boolean value True, otherwise, no change occurs**
