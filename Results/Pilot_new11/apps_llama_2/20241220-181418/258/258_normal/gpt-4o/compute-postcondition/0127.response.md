To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

1. The initial state provides information about several variables: `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, and `cx`. 
2. The code snippet provided is `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2`.
3. This line of code introduces a new variable `cy` and assigns it the average value of `y1` and `y2`.
4. None of the other variables are modified by this operation.

Given the information:

- `meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is a positive integer and at least 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are determined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`.
- `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- The new variable `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

The output state includes all the initial state variables and their conditions, plus the new variable `cy` and its value.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are determined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
