Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of triples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is less than `K`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the program moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program ends the if condition without any further actions.***
