The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` was 2, so the new value of `index` is 2 + 3 = 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[4])`, `data` is a list of strings from user input, `index` is 5, and `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y, c)` or `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[4])`, `data` is a list of strings from user input, `index` is 5, and `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y, c)` or `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`**
