The value of `y` is updated to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Since `index` is 5, `y` becomes `int(data[6])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is an integer, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, and `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[5]), y, c)`**
