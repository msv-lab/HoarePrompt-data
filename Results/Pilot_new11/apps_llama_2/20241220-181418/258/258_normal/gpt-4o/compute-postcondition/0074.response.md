Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` are calculated based on the last iteration, `count` is either the final sum or the value leading to early return if `count >= K`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second triple in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the third triple in `meats`. The current value of `c1` and `c2` are such that `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`.**
