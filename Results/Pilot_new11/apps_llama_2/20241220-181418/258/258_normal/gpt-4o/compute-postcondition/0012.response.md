The code `x = int(data[index])` assigns the value of the integer conversion of the string at index 5 in the list `data` to the variable `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `index` is 5, `x` becomes the integer value of `data[5]`. The previous values of `N`, `K`, `y`, `c`, `data`, and `meats` remain unchanged, but `meats` contains a tuple with the new value of `x`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, and `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[5]), y, c)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, and `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[5]), y, c)`**
