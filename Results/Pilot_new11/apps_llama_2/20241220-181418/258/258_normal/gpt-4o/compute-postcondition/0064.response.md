To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides various variables and their relationships:
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is at least 3.
- `i` is at most 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `meats` is a list of triples.
- `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`.
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`.
- The condition `d * d2` is greater than `d2` implies that `d` is greater than 1 because `d2` is not zero (given the context and the fact that `d2` is used in division, implying it has a non-zero value).

Given the code:
```python
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```
Let's simplify the expression for `mx`:
- `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d^2) / d2`
- Since `d2 * d - d^2 = d * (d2 - d)`, the expression becomes `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`
- Given that `d > 1` (from the condition that `d * d2 > d2`), and knowing that `d2` is positive (because it's a sum of squares divided by 4), the term `math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d))` is real because `d * (d2 - d)` is positive (since `d > 1` and `d2 > 0`).

Thus, `mx` is assigned a new value based on the existing values of `cx`, `dy`, `d`, and `d2`.

The output state, considering the initial conditions and the changes made by the code, is:
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is at least 3.
- `i` is at most 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `meats` is a list of triples.
- `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`.
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`.
- `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.
- The condition `d > 1` holds.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, and `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, with `d > 1`.**
