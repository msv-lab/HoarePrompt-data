Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of triples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is less than `K` and might have changed, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. If `d` is less than 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop; otherwise, the program proceeds with the current state of variables.***
