The code appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list. The values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are integers equal to `int(data[2])`, `int(data[3])`, and `int(data[4])` respectively. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `N` is still an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `index` is still 2, and `data` is still a list of strings from user input.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[4])`, `data` is a list of strings from user input, `index` is 2, and `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and greater than 0, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[4])`, `data` is a list of strings from user input, `index` is 2, and `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y, c)` or `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`.**
