Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values of the triple at `meats[2]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[5]` and the values of the triple at `meats[5]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[2]`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `x1`, `y1`, `c1` being the values of the triple at `meats[2]` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` being the values of the triple at `meats[5]`.**
