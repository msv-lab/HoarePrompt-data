The code appends a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are integers equal to `int(data[5])`, `int(data[6])`, and `int(data[7])` respectively. 

After the code is executed, the `meats` list now contains two tuples: the original tuple `(int(data[5]), y, old_c)` and the new tuple `(x, y, c)`. Since `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`, the first element of both tuples is the same.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[7])`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, and `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[5]), y, old_c)` and `(x, y, c)` which is equivalent to `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is an integer equal to `int(data[6])`, `c` is an integer equal to `int(data[7])`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, and `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), old_c)` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`**
