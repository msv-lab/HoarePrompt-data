The code introduces a new variable `dx` and assigns it the value of the average of the difference between `x1` and `x2`, which is `(x1 - x2) / 2`. 

The values of `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `meats`, `d`, `cx`, and `cy` are not changed by the code.

Since `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, we can rearrange it to `x1 + x2 = 2*cx`. However, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, which does not provide direct values for `x1` and `x2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`**
