Postcondition: ***`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values of the triples at index `i` and `j` in `meats` are swapped, i.e., `x1`, `y1`, `c1` become the values of the triple at index `j` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` become the values of the triple at index `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
