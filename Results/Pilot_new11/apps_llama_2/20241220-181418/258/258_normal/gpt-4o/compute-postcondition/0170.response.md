The code calculates `d` as `c1 * T - c2 * T`. The value of `d` was previously `T * (1/c1 - 1/c2)` or `T * (1/meats[4][2] - 1/meats[2][2])` depending on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`. However, since `c1 * T - c2 * T = T * (c1 - c2)` and `T * (1/c1 - 1/c2) = T * (c2 - c1) / (c1 * c2)`, we can simplify `d` as `d = T * (c1 - c2)`.

However, we also know that `c1 * T < c2 * T` or `c1 < c2` in the first case and `c1 > c2` in the second case. Therefore, in the first case, `d` will always be negative and in the second case `d` will always be positive.
