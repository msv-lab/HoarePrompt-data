The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables. 

Given that, we don't have any information that any loop is being run, but let's assume it is. Since `continue` only skips the rest of the code for the current iteration and does not change any variable values, all variables maintain their current state.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `count` is less than `K` and might have changed, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
