Correctness: **False**.

The problem description states that the goal is to find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if Takahashi puts the heat source to minimize this time. The code attempts to solve this problem by performing a binary search to converge on a value representing the minimum time required. However, the code does not correctly implement the problem description.

The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which checks if a certain condition is met regarding the readiness of meat pieces based on their hardness, coordinates, and a given time threshold. The function assumes that the heat source can only be placed at specific points, which are the midpoints of the lines connecting pairs of meat pieces. This assumption is not justified by the problem description, which allows the heat source to be placed at any point in the two-dimensional plane.

As a result, the code may not find the optimal solution in cases where the heat source needs to be placed at a point that is not the midpoint of any pair of meat pieces. For example, consider a scenario where three pieces of meat are located at points (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0.5, 1) with hardness values of 1, 1, and 2, respectively, and K = 2. The optimal placement of the heat source would be at point (0.5, 0.25), but the code would not consider this point as a possible solution.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
