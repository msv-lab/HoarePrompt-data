Based on the provided output hints and the original assessment, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically in the way it reads the input data.

The problem description states that the input is given in the following format:
```
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
x_2 y_2 c_2
...
x_N y_N c_N
```

However, the program reads all the input data at once using `data = input().split()`, which is incorrect. This will cause the program to fail for inputs where the number of pieces of meat (N) is large.

The output hints confirm that the function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer input, or input that does not match the expected format, and does not check if the integers N, K, x, y, and c are within the expected ranges.

Therefore, I agree with the original assessment that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
