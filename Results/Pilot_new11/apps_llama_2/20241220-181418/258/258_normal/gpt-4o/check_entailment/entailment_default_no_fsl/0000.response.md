Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be a solution to the problem of finding the minimum time required to cook a certain number of pieces of meat, given their hardness, coordinates, and a heat source. 

The code uses a binary search approach to find the minimum time, with the `func_1` function checking whether a certain time threshold is sufficient to cook the required number of pieces of meat. The `func_2` function performs the binary search, and the `func_3` function reads the input and prints the result.

The code seems to be correct because it:

- Reads the input correctly and handles it according to the problem description.
- Uses a binary search approach to find the minimum time, which is an efficient and correct method for this problem.
- Checks all possible pairs of meat pieces in `func_1`, ensuring that the condition for a certain time threshold is met.
- The `func_2` function uses the binary search to converge on the minimum time within a precision of 1e-07, which meets the problem's requirements.

The provided output hints for each function agree with the code and do not indicate any potential issues or edge cases that the code does not handle.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, and all the examples that can be thought of seem to work correctly, the code can be considered correct. 

The only potential issue could be the case when `K` equals `N`, but even in that case, the code will still work correctly because it checks for the condition `count >= K` in `func_1`, which will be true if all pieces of meat are cooked within the given time threshold. 

However, the code does not handle cases where the input is not well-formed, such as non-integer input or input that does not match the expected format. But as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid, so this is not considered an issue.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the code is correct for every potential case.
