    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is a list of triples potentially rearranged based on hardness and time conditions, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of pieces of meat, `i` equals `N-1`, `j` has iterated over its range, and other variables (`x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`) have values determined by the last iteration of the loop or early return conditions.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a certain condition is met regarding the readiness of meat pieces based on their hardness, coordinates, and a given time threshold. It accepts a list of meat pieces `meats`, where each piece is represented by a triple of integers (x-coordinate, y-coordinate, hardness), an integer `K` representing the minimum number of pieces to be considered ready, and a real number `T` representing the maximum allowed time. The function iterates over pairs of meat pieces, calculates various geometric and temporal conditions, and checks if the count of pieces that meet a specific distance condition from a calculated point is greater than or equal to `K`. If this condition is met at any point during the iteration, the function returns `True`. If the condition is not met after checking all pairs, the function returns `False`, indicating that the minimum number of meat pieces are not ready within the given time threshold. The function's return value indicates whether the minimum readiness condition is satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`), without modifying the original list of meat pieces or other input parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is an integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat required to be ready, and meats is a list of lists where each sublist contains the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `meats` is a list of lists, `low` and `high` have converged to within `1e-07` of each other, with `high - low <= 1e-07`.
    return high
    #The program returns `high`, a value that has converged with `low` to within a precision of `1e-07` or less.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N` (an integer representing the number of pieces of meat), `K` (an integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat required to be ready), and `meats` (a list of lists where each sublist contains the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat). It then performs a binary search to converge on a value `high` within a precision of `1e-07` or less, utilizing a helper function `func_1` to determine the convergence criteria based on `meats`, `K`, and the current mid-value. The final state of the program after execution is the return of `high`, which represents the converged value. The function does not modify the input parameters `N`, `K`, or `meats`. The purpose of the function appears to be finding a threshold value related to the readiness of the pieces of meat, as determined by `func_1`, with the given constraints. The function handles potential edge cases by ensuring convergence within a specified precision, but the logic of `func_1` and its impact on the convergence is not detailed in the provided annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer between 1 and 60, K is a positive integer between 1 and N, and data is a list of strings where data[0] and data[1] can be converted to integers N and K, and the rest of the data can be converted to a list of 3-tuples (x, y, c) where x, y, and c can be converted to integers between -1000 and 1000, -1000 and 1000, and 1 and 100 respectively.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, each containing three integers extracted from the `data` list, `index` is `2 + 3 * N`, and `data` is a list of strings from user input.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, parses it into integers N, K, and a list of 3-tuples (x, y, c), then calls another function `func_2` with these parameters and prints the result. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking. After the function concludes, the program state will be updated with the parsed integers N and K, and the list of 3-tuples (x, y, c) from the input, and the result of `func_2(N, K, meats)` will be printed to the console with six decimal places. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer input, or input that does not match the expected format. If the input is malformed, the function may raise an exception or produce unexpected results. The function also does not check if the integers N, K, x, y, and c are within the expected ranges, which could lead to further errors if `func_2` relies on these ranges.
