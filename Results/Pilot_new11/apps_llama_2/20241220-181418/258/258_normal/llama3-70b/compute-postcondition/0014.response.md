To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop iterates over a range of `y` values from -1000 to 1000. For each `y` value, it calculates `times` using the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, sorts `times`, and updates `ans` with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `times[K - 1]`.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe that:

- `K` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` remains a positive integer.
- `x` remains -1000.
- `y` takes on the current value in the iteration, starting from -1000 and incrementing up to 1000.
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for the current `y` value.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Considering the loop will execute 2001 times (for each `y` value from -1000 to 1000), after all iterations, `y` will have taken on its final value, which is 1000.

The value of `ans` will be the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values calculated across all iterations. Since `ans` is initially set to positive infinity, it will be updated to the smallest `times[K - 1]` value encountered during the loop's execution.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`**
