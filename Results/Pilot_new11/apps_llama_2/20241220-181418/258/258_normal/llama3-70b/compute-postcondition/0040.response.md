The `times` list is sorted in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`.
Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`**
