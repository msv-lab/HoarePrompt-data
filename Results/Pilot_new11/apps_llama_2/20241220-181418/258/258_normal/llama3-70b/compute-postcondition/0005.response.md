To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` is a positive integer.
- `ans` is positive infinity.
- `x` is -1000.
- `y` is -1000.
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (positive infinity) and the value of `times` at index `K - 1`.

Given that `times` is sorted, and without knowing the exact return values of `func_2`, we can infer that `times[K - 1]` will be one of the values returned by `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`, sorted in ascending order.

Since `ans` initially is positive infinity, and it's being updated to be the minimum between itself and `times[K - 1]`, `ans` will now hold the value of `times[K - 1]`, because any number (assuming `times[K - 1]` is a real number) is less than positive infinity.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is updated, but the values of `K`, `N`, `x`, `y`, and `times` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.**
