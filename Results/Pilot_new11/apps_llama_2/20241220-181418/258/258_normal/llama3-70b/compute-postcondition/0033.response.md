To calculate the result, let's consider the given Initial State and the provided Python code snippet.

The Initial State is:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a positive integer
- `ans` is the minimum of the old `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -1000
- `times` is still the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`

The given Python code snippet is:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

Given that `ans` initially holds the minimum of `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000, and the code updates `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`, we essentially ensure that `ans` now holds the minimum value between its previous minimum and the specific `times[K - 1]` value.

Since `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, and considering that `K` is a positive integer within the bounds of `N`, `times[K - 1]` refers to a specific element in the sorted `times` list/array.

Therefore, after executing the given code, the value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its original minimum value (considering all `y` from -1000 to 1000) and the value of `times[K - 1]`.

The states of `K`, `N`, `x`, `y`, and `times` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its old value and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, and `times` is still the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`**
