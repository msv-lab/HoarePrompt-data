The code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `ans` is already the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`, this means `ans` remains the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`. The other variables, `K`, `N`, `x`, `y`, and `times`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`**
