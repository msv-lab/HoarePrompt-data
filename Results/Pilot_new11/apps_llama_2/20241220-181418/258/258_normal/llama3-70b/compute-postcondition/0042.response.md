To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the provided information and the loop code step by step.

1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop iterates over `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. This means `y` will take on every integer value in this range, one at a time, for a total of 2001 iterations.

2. **Initialization and Updates**:
   - `K` and `N` are positive integers where `1 <= K <= N`. These do not change within the loop.
   - `x` is initialized to -998 and remains constant throughout the loop.
   - `y` starts at -1000 and increments up to 1000, changing with each iteration.
   - `times` is recalculated and sorted in each iteration based on the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.
   - `ans` starts as the minimum of `times[K - 1]` for all possible `y` from -1000 to 1000, based on the initial `times` calculated from `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`. It then gets updated in each iteration to be the minimum of its current value and the new `times[K - 1]`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - `K` and `N` remain unchanged.
   - `x` remains -998.
   - `y` will have iterated through all values from -1000 to 1000, so after the loop, `y` will be 1000 (since it ends at this value after the last iteration).
   - `times` will be the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, 1000, -998, 1000)`, reflecting the last iteration's calculation.
   - `ans` will be the minimum of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations. Since `times` is recalculated for each `y` and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the new `times[K - 1]`, `ans` will hold the smallest `times[K - 1]` found across all possible `y` values from -1000 to 1000.

Given these points, we can determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` across all `y` from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -998, `y` is 1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, 1000, -998, 1000)`.**
