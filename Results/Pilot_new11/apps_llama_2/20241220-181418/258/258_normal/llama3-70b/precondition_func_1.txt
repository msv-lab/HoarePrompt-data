x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the pieces of meat, X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates of the heat source, c is a list of integers representing the hardness of each piece of meat, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the x and y coordinates and the hardness of a piece of meat, such that len(x) == len(y) == len(c) == len(meats) and all values are consistent across these lists.
