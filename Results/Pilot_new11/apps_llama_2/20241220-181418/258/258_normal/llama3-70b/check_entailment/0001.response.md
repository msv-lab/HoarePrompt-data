Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One of the main issues is that it doesn't correctly calculate the time for each piece of meat to be ready. In Function 2, it seems like it is trying to calculate the time for each meat, but it's using the x and y of the current iteration, which is incorrect. It should be using the x and y of each meat.

Another issue is that it tries all possible integer coordinates for the heat source, but the problem states that the coordinates can be real numbers, not just integers. So, this approach is not going to find the optimal solution in all cases.

Lastly, Function 2 seems to be incorrectly implemented as it takes x and y as arguments but then uses the global meats list. The function should take the list of meats and the coordinates of the heat source, not the coordinates of a specific meat.

A correct approach would involve finding the optimal position of the heat source, which could involve using a more complex algorithm or optimization technique.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3 2
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1

The program will try all integer coordinates for the heat source, but it won't find the optimal solution, which is to place the heat source at (1, 0) to minimize the time for 2 or more pieces of meat to be ready.

To fix this issue, a more complex algorithm or optimization technique would be needed, possibly involving the use of floating point numbers or a more advanced mathematical approach. 

Here is a better implementation of the functions:
```python
import math
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def func_1(meats, X, Y):
    return [c * math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2) for x, y, c in meats]

def func_2(meats, X, Y, K):
    times = func_1(meats, X, Y)
    times.sort()
    return times[K - 1]

def func_3(meats, K):
    def objective(vars):
        X, Y = vars
        return func_2(meats, X, Y, K)
    
    res = minimize(objective, [0, 0]) # start from (0, 0)
    return res.fun

N, K = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    x, y, c = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))

ans = func_3(meats, K)
print(ans)
```
This code uses the minimize function from scipy to find the optimal position of the heat source. The objective function to minimize is the time for K or more pieces of meat to be ready. The initial guess for the position is (0, 0), but this can be changed if a better initial guess is known.
