Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the `func_2` and `func_3` functions. 

In `func_2`, the function is supposed to calculate the time it takes for each piece of meat to be ready given the coordinates of the heat source. However, the function uses the variable `meats` which is not defined within the function or passed as an argument. The function is also supposed to accept parameters `x` and `y` which are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the pieces of meat, but in the `func_3` function, it is called with two integers `x` and `y` instead of lists.

In `func_3`, the function is supposed to find the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready. However, the function only checks integer coordinates for the heat source, whereas the problem description states that the coordinates of the heat source can be any real numbers. This means that the function may not find the optimal solution if the optimal coordinates are not integers.

Another issue is that the `func_2` function is called with the same coordinates `x` and `y` for the heat source and the pieces of meat, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The function should be called with the coordinates of the heat source and the coordinates of each piece of meat separately.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
