Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state remains as in the precondition since there is no else part to modify it.***
