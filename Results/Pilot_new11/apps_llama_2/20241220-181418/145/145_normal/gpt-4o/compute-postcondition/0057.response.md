Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
