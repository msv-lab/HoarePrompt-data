Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is 0, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code***
