Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is 0, if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is either 3 or 4. If `current_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, the state of the variables is unchanged from the precondition, `segment_count` remains either 2 or 3, and `i` remains 2.***
