The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `segment_count` is either 2 or 3, so after the increment, `segment_count` is either 3 or 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is 0, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 2**
