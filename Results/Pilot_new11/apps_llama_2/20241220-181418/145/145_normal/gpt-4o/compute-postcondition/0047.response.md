Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of the original `ticket`, if `n` is 0 then `current_sum` is 0 and `segment_count` is 0, otherwise `current_sum` is the sum of the remaining digits not forming a complete segment or 0 if the last segment sums to `target_sum`, and `segment_count` is the number of complete segments whose sum equals `target_sum`. Additionally, either `current_sum` is not 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.**
