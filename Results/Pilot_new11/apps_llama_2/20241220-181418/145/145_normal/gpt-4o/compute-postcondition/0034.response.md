According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `i` is 1**
