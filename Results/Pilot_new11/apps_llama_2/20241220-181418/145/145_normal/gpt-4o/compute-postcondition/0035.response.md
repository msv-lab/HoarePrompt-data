The value of `current_sum` is increased by the integer value of the digit at index `i` in the `ticket` string. The index `i` is 1, so we are looking at the second digit in the `ticket` string. The `ticket` string is of length `n`, which is greater than 1, and consists of digits. The `segment_length` is 2, but it does not affect this operation. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 1, the value of `ticket` is still a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is still 2, and `i` is still 1. 

The value of `current_sum` is now the old value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[1]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2, `i` is 1, `current_sum` is the old value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[1]`.**
