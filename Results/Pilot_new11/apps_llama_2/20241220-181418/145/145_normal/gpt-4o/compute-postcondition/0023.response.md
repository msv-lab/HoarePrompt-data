Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` is the integer value of the first digit of the original `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the remaining digits in `ticket` that do not equal `target_sum`, and `segment_count` is the number of times the sum of the digits equals `target_sum`. Either `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is less than or equal to 1.**
