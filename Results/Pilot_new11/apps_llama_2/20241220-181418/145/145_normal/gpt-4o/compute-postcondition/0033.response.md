Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 2. If the sum of the first two digits of `ticket` equals the sum of the first two digits of `ticket` (i.e., `current_sum` equals `target_sum`), then `target_sum` is reset to the first digit of `ticket`, `current_sum` is reset to 0, `segment_count` is set to 1, and `i` remains 0. If the sum of the first two digits of `ticket` does not equal the sum of the first two digits of `ticket` (i.e., `current_sum` does not equal `target_sum`), then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
