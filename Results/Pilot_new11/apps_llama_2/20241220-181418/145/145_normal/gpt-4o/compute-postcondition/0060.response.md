The code resets `current_sum` to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and greater than `i + 1`, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` could be 1 if the previous value of `current_sum` equals `target_sum` before `current_sum` was reset, and `i` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer and greater than `i + 1`, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` could be 1, and `i` is `i + 1`**
