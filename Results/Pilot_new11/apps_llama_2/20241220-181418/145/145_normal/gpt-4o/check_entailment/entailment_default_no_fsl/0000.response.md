Correctness: **False**

The code does not do what the problem description says for every potential case. 

In the function `func_1`, it only checks for segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, but it does not consider the case where the first segment can be longer than `n-1`. 

For example, if we have the input `n = 3` and `ticket = 111`, the function `func_1` will not return `'YES'` because it does not check for a segment length of `n`. However, this ticket is lucky because it can be divided into three segments of equal sum: `1`, `1`, and `1`.

Another issue with the function `func_1` is that it uses the `segment_sum` function which is defined outside the scope of `func_1` and uses a global variable `ticket` which is not defined in the scope of `segment_sum`. This will cause a `NameError` when the `segment_sum` function is called.

To fix this, we can modify the `func_1` function to correctly check all possible segment lengths and define the `segment_sum` function inside the scope of `func_1` or pass the `ticket` as an argument to `segment_sum`. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:
```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    def segment_sum(start, end, ticket):
        return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    
    for segment_length in range(1, n + 1):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1, ticket)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```
