Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. It only checks for segments of lengths from 1 to `n-1` and attempts to divide the ticket into segments of the same sum starting from the first segment of the current length. However, it does not consider all possible segment lengths and starting positions.

For example, if the ticket is "73452", the program will first try to divide it into segments of length 1, which will not work because the sums will not be equal. Then it will try to divide it into segments of length 2, which will also not work. However, the ticket can be divided into segments of lengths 1, 2, and 2 (7, 34, 52) which have equal sums.

The program should be modified to check all possible segment lengths and starting positions, not just the ones starting from the beginning of the ticket. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code might look:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        for start in range(n - segment_length + 1):
            target_sum = sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, start + segment_length))
            current_sum = 0
            segment_count = 0
            for i in range(n):
                current_sum += int(ticket[i])
                if current_sum == target_sum:
                    current_sum = 0
                    segment_count += 1
            if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```
This corrected version of the program checks all possible segment lengths and starting positions, which should give the correct result according to the problem description.
