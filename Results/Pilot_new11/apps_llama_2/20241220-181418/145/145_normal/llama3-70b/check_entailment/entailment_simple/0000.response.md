Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. 

The problem description states that a ticket is considered lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. However, the program only checks if the ticket can be divided into segments with sums equal to half of the total sum. 

For example, the ticket "350178" can be divided into segments with equal sums: 350, 17, and 8. However, the program would not consider this ticket lucky because the sum of each segment (3+5+0 = 8, 1+7 = 8, 8 = 8) is not equal to half of the total sum (3+5+0+1+7+8 = 24, 24/2 = 12).

The program should check all possible segment sums, not just half of the total sum. It should iterate through all possible segment sums and check if the ticket can be divided into two or more segments with that sum. 

Here's a possible correction to the program:

```python
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum):
        segments = 0
        curr_sum = 0
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
        if segments >= 2 and curr_sum == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This version of the program checks all possible segment sums and returns True if the ticket can be divided into two or more segments with any of those sums. It also checks that the remaining sum after the last segment is 0, to ensure that all digits are used exactly once.
