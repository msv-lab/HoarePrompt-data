Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue is with the function `func_1` where it checks if a given string of digits, 'ticket', can be divided into at least two segments where the sum of the digits in each segment equals half of the total sum of the digits in 'ticket'. This is not in line with the problem description which requires the ticket to be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums, not necessarily equal to half of the total sum.

For example, the ticket "73452" can be divided into three segments: 7, 34, and 52, where each segment has a sum of 7, 7, and 7 respectively. However, the function `func_1` would not consider this as a valid division because it only checks for segments that sum up to half of the total sum, which is 17 in this case.

Another issue is that the function only checks for segments that start and end at the beginning and end of the ticket respectively. It does not consider all possible segments that can be formed from the ticket.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
