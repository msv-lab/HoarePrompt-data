The code introduces a new variable `curr_sum` and assigns it the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(ticket) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket`, `total_sum` is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, and `curr_sum` equals 0**
