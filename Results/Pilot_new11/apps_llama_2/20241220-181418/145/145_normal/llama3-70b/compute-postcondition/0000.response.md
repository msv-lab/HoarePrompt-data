To solve this, let's consider the given initial state and the Python code snippet provided. The initial state specifies that `ticket` is a string of digits where the length of the string is between 2 and 100 inclusive, and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9'. The code snippet calculates the sum of all characters in the `ticket` string and assigns this sum to a variable named `total_sum`.

Given the nature of the `ticket` string, when we sum its characters using `sum(ticket)`, Python will treat each character as its Unicode code point. Since the characters are digits from '0' to '9', their Unicode code points are consecutive, ranging from 48 (for '0') to 57 (for '9'). Therefore, the sum of these characters as calculated by `sum(ticket)` will not give the arithmetic sum of the digits they represent but rather the sum of their Unicode code points.

For example, if `ticket` is '12', `sum(ticket)` would calculate `48 + 49` (the Unicode code points for '1' and '2'), resulting in `97`, not `3`, which would be the arithmetic sum of the digits '1' and '2'.

However, the question does not seem to require this nuanced interpretation based on Unicode values but rather seems to aim towards understanding the direct outcome of the operation on the string of digits. Assuming the intention is to understand the sum of the digits as they are typically interpreted (i.e., the arithmetic sum of the digits '0' through '9'), one would usually convert each character to its integer equivalent (by subtracting the Unicode value of '0', which is 48, from the Unicode value of the character) before summing. But this step is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Given the code `total_sum = sum(ticket)`, and considering the typical intention behind summing digits in a string, the direct interpretation might be misleading without the conversion step. Assuming the code intends to calculate the arithmetic sum of the digits (which is a common interpretation but not what `sum(ticket)` directly does), one would expect a calculation that effectively converts each character to its numeric value before summing.

But sticking strictly to the provided code and its direct effect without additional interpretation or conversion:

- `ticket` remains a string of digits such that 2 <= len(ticket) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9'.
- `total_sum` is calculated as the sum of the Unicode code points of the characters in `ticket`, not the arithmetic sum of the digits they represent.

Therefore, the output state, considering the provided code's direct action without additional assumptions about intended digit sum calculation, is:

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(ticket) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket`.**
