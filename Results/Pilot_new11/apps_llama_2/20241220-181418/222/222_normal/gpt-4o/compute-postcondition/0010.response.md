The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. The previous value of `i` is `4 * k + 3`, so the new value of `i` is `(4 * k + 3) + (2 * k + 1)`, which simplifies to `6 * k + 4`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still greater than `4 * k + 3`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, and `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `4 * k + 3`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`, `i` is `6 * k + 4`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `4 * k + 3`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`, `i` is `6 * k + 4`**
