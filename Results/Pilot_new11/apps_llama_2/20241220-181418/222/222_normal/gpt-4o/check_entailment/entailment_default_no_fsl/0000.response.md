Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(n, k)` generates and prints an arithmetic sequence of positions with a common difference of `2k + 1`, starting at `1` and ending at the largest term less than or equal to `n`. This sequence represents the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers.

The code correctly handles edge cases, such as when `k` is `0` (resulting in a sequence of consecutive integers) or when `n` is less than or equal to `1` (resulting in a sequence of length `1` or `0`, respectively).

The provided examples in the problem description also match the output of the code. For example, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the code outputs `2` and `1 6`, which is a valid solution. Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the code outputs `2` and `1 4`, which is also a valid solution.

The code assumes that the input will be valid, which means `n` and `k` will be within the specified ranges (`1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`). Under this assumption, the code works correctly for all potential cases.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
