Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code generates an arithmetic sequence of positions with a common difference of 2k + 1, starting at 1 and ending at the largest term less than or equal to n. This sequence represents the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over to achieve the minimum number of actions required to turn over all n skewers.

The code handles edge cases, such as when k is 0 (resulting in a sequence of consecutive integers) or when n is less than or equal to 1 (resulting in a sequence of length 1 or 0, respectively). It also does not modify the input variables n and k.

The provided examples also work correctly with this code. For instance, in the first example with n = 7 and k = 2, the output is 2 and the positions are 1 and 6. This is correct because turning over skewers 1, 2, and 3, and then skewers 4, 5, 6, and 7, results in all skewers being turned over.

Similarly, in the second example with n = 5 and k = 1, the output is 2 and the positions are 1 and 4. This is also correct because turning over skewers 1, 2, and 3, and then skewers 3, 4, and 5, results in all skewers being turned over.

The output hints agree with the code, and they provide a clear explanation of how the code generates the sequence of positions. The code's side effect of printing the results also matches the problem description.

Since the code correctly handles all potential cases and produces the expected output for the provided examples, and the output hints agree with the code, the correctness of the code is True.
