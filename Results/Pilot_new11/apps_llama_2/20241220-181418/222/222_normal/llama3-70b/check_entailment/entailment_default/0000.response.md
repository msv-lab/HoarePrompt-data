Correctness: **True**

The code seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers. It first determines the number of actions `l` by dividing `n + k - 1` by `2 * k + 1`, where `k` is the number of skewers turned in each step. Then, it generates a list of skewer numbers that should be turned over in each step, using an arithmetic progression with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`. 

The output hints agree with the code, and the code handles edge cases where `l` is 0 (i.e., `(n + k - 1)` is less than `(k * 2 + 1)`), in which case it prints 0 and an empty list.

After analyzing the provided examples (e.g., input 7 2 and input 5 1), it can be observed that the code produces the expected output. For example, given the input 7 2, the code outputs 2, which is the minimum number of actions, and then prints 1 and 6, which are the skewer numbers that should be turned over in each step.

Since the code seems to handle all potential cases correctly and produce the expected output for the given examples, it can be concluded that the code is correct.
