The function appears to be missing parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, I will describe the expected functionality.


The function `func` should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. The constraints for these parameters are `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`. Since there is no output description provided, I will wait for the complete information.


If the output description were provided, I could give a proper answer. For now, I can only describe the parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer, with constraints 1 <= n <= 1000 and 0 <= k <= 1000.**
