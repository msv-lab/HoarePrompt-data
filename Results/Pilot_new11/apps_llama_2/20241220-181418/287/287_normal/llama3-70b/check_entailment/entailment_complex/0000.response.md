Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given integer `n`, where a split is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements equal to the first element of the split. 

The program, however, calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, not the number of different weights of splits. The program iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, counts the divisors, and handles the case when `n` is a perfect square. This approach does not consider the splits of `n` or their weights as defined in the problem description.

A correct solution would involve generating all possible splits of `n` and then calculating the weight of each split according to the problem's definition. The program would then need to count the number of distinct weights found among all the splits.

For example, for `n = 7`, the splits and their weights are as follows:
- `[7]`, weight = 1
- `[4, 3]`, weight = 1
- `[4, 2, 1]`, weight = 1
- `[4, 1, 1, 1]`, weight = 1
- `[3, 3, 1]`, weight = 2
- `[3, 2, 2]`, weight = 1
- `[3, 2, 1, 1]`, weight = 1
- `[3, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, weight = 1
- `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, weight = 3
- `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1]`, weight = 2
- `[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, weight = 1
- `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, weight = 7

The distinct weights are 1, 2, 3, and 7, so the correct answer for `n = 7` is 4, as given in the problem description. The provided program does not correctly calculate this.
