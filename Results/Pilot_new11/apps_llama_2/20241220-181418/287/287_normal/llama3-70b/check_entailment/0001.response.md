Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It appears to be designed to count the number of divisors of a given number `n`, not the number of different weights of its splits.

A correct solution should iterate over possible weights (from 1 to `n`), and for each weight, it should check if there exists a valid split with that weight.

For example, if we input `n = 8`, the correct output should be `5`, corresponding to the splits `[8]`, `[4, 4]`, `[3, 3, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, and `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

However, the provided code will output `4` for `n = 8` (since it counts the divisors of `8`, not the weights of its splits), demonstrating its incorrectness.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to implement a different approach, potentially involving recursion or dynamic programming to generate and count all valid splits of the given number `n`. 

Below is a simple example of how you might start to implement this in Python, although this solution still has room for optimization:

```python
def func(n):
    res = set()
    def dfs(n, path, idx):
        if n == 0:
            res.add(len(path))
            return
        for i in range(idx, 0, -1):
            if i <= n:
                dfs(n-i, path + [i], i)
    dfs(n, [], n)
    return len(res)

n = int(input())
print(func(n))
```
