According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the square root of `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be its current value plus 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is its current value plus 1, if `n` is a perfect square (i.e., `(i-1) * (i-1) == n`), then `res` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, if `n` is not a perfect square but is divisible by `(i-1)`, then `res` is an integer equal to `n + 2`, if `n` is neither a perfect square nor divisible by `(i-1)`, the state of `res` is not updated, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `(i)**2` for the loop to have a next iteration**
