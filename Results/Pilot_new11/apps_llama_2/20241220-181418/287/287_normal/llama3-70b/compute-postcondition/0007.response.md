The value of `res` is decreased by 1. Since `res` was 2, it becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The current value of `i` is 1, and `n` is the square of `i`, so `n` is 1. Also, since `n` is a multiple of `i` and `n` equals `i` squared and `res` equals 1, then all these conditions are still valid.
Output State: **`n` is 1, `i` is 1, `res` is 1, `n` is a square of `i`, and `n` is a multiple of `i`**
