The provided code snippet is a print statement that outputs the value of `res`. 

Given the output state before this print statement is `n` is an integer, `res` is the total number of divisors of `n`, the code simply prints the current value of `res`.

The output of the print statement will be the total number of divisors of `n`, which is the value of `res`. The print statement itself does not change the values of `n` or `res`, it merely outputs the value of `res` to the console.

Therefore, after executing the print statement, the state of the variables remains the same as before the print statement, with `n` being an integer and `res` being the total number of divisors of `n`.

Also, the value of `res` has been returned at the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `res` is the total number of divisors of `n` and the value of `res` has been returned at the output.**
