Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description. The task is to find the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`, where a split is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements equal to the first element.

The provided program calculates the number of divisors of `n`, which is not the same as finding the number of different weights of splits. 

For example, when `n = 8`, the program will output `4` (because the divisors of `8` are `1`, `2`, `4`, and `8`), but the correct output should be `5`, because the possible weights of splits of `8` are `1` (`[8]`), `2` (`[4, 4]`), `2` (`[3, 3, 2]` is not considered because `3` is not repeated `2` times, but `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is considered), `3` (`[2, 2, 2, 2]` is not considered because `2` is repeated `4` times, but `[3, 3, 2]` is not considered, however `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]` is considered), `4` (`[2, 2, 2, 2]`), and `5` is not a possible weight because `8` is not greater than or equal to `5 * 5`, however the weight `5` is not possible because `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` but `1` is repeated `8` times and `8` is greater than `5` but no `[5, 3]`, `[5, 2, 1]`, `[5, 1, 1, 1]` etc but `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, however `1` is repeated `8` times so `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` weight `8`).

The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible splits of `n` and counting the number of different weights.

One correct solution could involve the following steps:

*   Iterate over all possible first elements of the split from `1` to `n`.
*   For each first element, iterate over all possible numbers of times it appears in the split.
*   Check if the remaining sum can be formed by a non-increasing sequence of positive integers.
*   Count the number of different weights.

Here's an example of a correct Python solution:
```python
def count_weights(n):
    weights = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n // i + 1):
            remaining_sum = n - i * j
            k = i
            count = j
            while remaining_sum > 0:
                if remaining_sum < k:
                    break
                count += remaining_sum // k
                remaining_sum -= (remaining_sum // k) * k
                k -= 1
            if remaining_sum == 0:
                weights.add(j)
    return len(weights)

n = int(input())
print(count_weights(n))
