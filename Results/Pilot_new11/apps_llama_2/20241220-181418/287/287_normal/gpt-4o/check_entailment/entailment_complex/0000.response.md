Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. The problem asks for the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`, where a weight is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. However, the provided program calculates the total number of divisors of `n`.

The program uses a loop to iterate through all numbers up to the square root of `n` and counts the divisors by checking if `n` is divisible by each number. This is a correct approach for calculating the number of divisors, but it does not relate to the concept of splits and weights as defined in the problem.

For example, for the input `7`, the program will return `4` because `7` has four divisors: `1`, `7`. However, the correct answer according to the problem description is indeed `4`, but this is a coincidence. The correct calculation for the number of different weights of splits of `7` involves considering the possible splits: `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which have weights `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`, respectively.

In general, the program does not consider the concept of splits and weights and therefore does not meet the problem description. It only calculates the number of divisors of the input number, which is a different problem. 

A correct program would need to generate all possible splits of the input number `n` and then calculate the weight of each split, finally returning the number of distinct weights. The provided program does not perform this task.
