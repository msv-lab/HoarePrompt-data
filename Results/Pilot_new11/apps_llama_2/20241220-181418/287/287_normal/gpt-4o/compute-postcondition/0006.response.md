The code increments the `count` variable by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so after the increment, `count` becomes 2. The other variables, `num` and `i`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `count` is 2, `i` is 1, and `num` is divisible by `i`, where `i` is not equal to `num` divided by `i`.**
