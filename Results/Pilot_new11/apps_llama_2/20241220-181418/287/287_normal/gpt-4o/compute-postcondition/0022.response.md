To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates through possible divisors of `num`, starting from 1 and going up to the square root of `num`. For each divisor `i` found, it increments `count` by 1, and if `i` is not the square root of `num` (i.e., `i!= num // i`), it increments `count` again because `num // i` is also a divisor.

The loop condition `i * i <= num` ensures that the loop checks divisors up to the square root of `num`, which is a common optimization for finding all divisors of a number.

After analyzing the provided output states after the loop executes a few times, we can infer the following:

- `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `num` because that's when `i * i` first exceeds `num`, ending the loop.
- `count` accumulates the total number of divisors of `num`.

Thus, the final state can be summarized as follows:

- `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of the original value of `num`.
- `count` will hold the total number of divisors of the original value of `num`.
- `num` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of the original value of `num`, `count` is the total number of divisors of the original value of `num`, `num` remains unchanged**
