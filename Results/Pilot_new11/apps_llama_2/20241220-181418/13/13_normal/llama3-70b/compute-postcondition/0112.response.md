The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. The variables `n`, `s`, `golden`, `i`, `j`, and `beauty` retain their values, as the `break` statement does not modify them. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` is 1 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
