To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

The loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right. It maintains two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `right` is the current index being processed, and `left` is used to track the position of the last 'G' character when a sequence of 'S' characters is encountered.

- `curr_beauty` is incremented whenever a 'G' character is encountered at the `right` index.
- When an 'S' character is encountered at the `right` index, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, and then `curr_beauty` is reset to 0. The `left` pointer is then moved forward until it points to a 'G' character or reaches the `right` index. If `left` is less than `right` after this adjustment, it means `left` now points to a 'G' character, so `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.

After the loop finishes iterating over the entire string `s`, the values of the variables can be summarized as follows:

- `n` remains unchanged as it is the input length of the string `s`.
- `s` also remains unchanged as it is the input string.
- `golden` is not modified within the loop, so it retains its initial value, which is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` will hold the maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters encountered in the string `s`. This is because `max_beauty` is updated whenever a sequence of 'G' characters ends (i.e., when an 'S' character is encountered), and it keeps track of the maximum such sequence length seen so far.
- `curr_beauty` will be 0 if the last character in the string `s` is 'S', or it will be the length of the sequence of 'G' characters at the end of the string if the last character is 'G'. However, its final value is not directly relevant to the overall outcome, as `max_beauty` is the variable that tracks the maximum sequence length found.
- `left` and `right` are loop variables, and after the loop, `right` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string. The final value of `left` will depend on the last sequence of characters in the string but is not directly relevant to the output state.

Given these observations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters in `s`.**
