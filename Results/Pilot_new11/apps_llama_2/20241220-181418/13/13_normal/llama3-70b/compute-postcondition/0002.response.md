The code creates a new list called `golden` which stores the indices of the characters 'G' in the string `s`. The value of `n` remains the same, and the string `s` is not modified.

The list `golden` is created using a list comprehension, where `enumerate(s)` generates pairs of indices and corresponding characters in `s`. The condition `if x == 'G'` filters the pairs to only include those where the character is 'G'. The `i` in the list comprehension refers to the index of the 'G' characters.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.**
