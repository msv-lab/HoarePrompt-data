According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range `i - 1` to `-1`. If `j` is greater than `-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i - 2`, `i` is greater than `0`, `s` at index `i` is 'G' and `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S'. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decremented by 1, so `j` is `i - 3`. Since `i` is greater than `0`, `i - 3` can be greater than `-1` if `i` is greater than `2`. Other variables `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` remain unchanged as they are not related to the loop condition.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 2, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `j` is `i - 3`**
