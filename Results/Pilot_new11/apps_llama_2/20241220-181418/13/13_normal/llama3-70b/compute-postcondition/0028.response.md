The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was less than `right` and `s[left]` was 'S'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Since `left` is incremented by 1, it is still less than or equal to `right`. If the new `left` is equal to `right`, then the condition `left` must be less than `right` is no longer valid. However, if the new `left` is less than `right`, then the condition is still valid. 
We also know that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', and `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty` are not changed.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is less than or equal to `right`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is less than or equal to `right`.**
