To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and the changes made to the variables within the loop.

The loop continues to execute as long as `left < right` and `s[left]!= 'G'`. This means the loop will stop executing when either `left` is no longer less than `right` or when the character at the `left` index in string `s` is 'G'.

1. **Analysis of `left` and `right`**: 
   - Initially, `right` is incremented by 1, which suggests that before the loop starts, `right` is at least 1. 
   - `left` is incremented by 1 inside the loop until it reaches or surpasses `right` or until it points to a 'G' character in `s`.

2. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop terminates when `left` is no longer less than `right`. This could happen if `left` reaches `right` and `s[left]` is 'G', or if `left` exceeds `right` due to consecutive 'S' characters.
   - It also terminates when it encounters a 'G' character, which means `left` points to a 'G' in `s`.

3. **Values of Variables After Loop Execution**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged as its characters are not modified within the loop.
   - `golden` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `right` will have been incremented by 1 from its original value before the loop started.
   - `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are initialized to 0 but their values inside the loop are not specified. However, based on the loop provided, these variables do not change.
   - `left` will point to the first 'G' character it encounters from its starting position or will be equal to `right` if no 'G' is found before `right`. If all characters before `right` are 'S', then `left` will equal `right`.

Given the conditions and changes, the loop's primary purpose seems to be moving `left` towards the first 'G' that is less than `right` or until `left` meets or exceeds `right`. The final state of `left` and the relationship between `left` and `right` can depend on the distribution of 'G' and 'S' in `s`.

**Output State:** **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` either points to the first 'G' character it encounters from its starting position or equals `right` if no 'G' is found before `right` or if all characters before `right` are 'S'.**
