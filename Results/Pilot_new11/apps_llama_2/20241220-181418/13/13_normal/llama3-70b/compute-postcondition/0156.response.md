Based on the provided loop code and output states after a few iterations, we can analyze the behavior of the loop and its effects on the variables.

The loop iterates from `i + 2` to `n` and checks each character in the string `s`. If the character is 'G', it increments the `beauty` variable. If the character is 'S', it breaks out of the loop.

From the output states, we can see that:

- `n` must be at least `i + 2` for the loop to execute at least once.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, but its value does not change within the loop.
- `i` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `j` takes on the value of the current index in the loop, starting from `i + 2`.
- `beauty` is incremented by 1 for each 'G' character found in the string `s`, starting from the index `i + 2`, until an 'S' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables will have the following values:

- `n` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `s` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `golden` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `j` will be equal to the index of the last character checked in the loop, which is either `n` (if all characters from `i + 2` to `n` are 'G') or the index of the first 'S' character encountered after `i + 1`.
- `beauty` will be equal to the initial value of `beauty` (1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's found when moving backwards from `i - 1` until an 'S' is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached) plus the number of consecutive 'G' characters found from `i + 2` to the first 'S' character encountered or the end of the string.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is less than `i + 2`), the variables will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 1` or `n` if all characters from `i + 2` to `n` are 'G', and `beauty` is 1 plus the number of consecutive 'G's found when moving backwards from `i - 1` until an 'S' is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, plus the number of consecutive 'G' characters found from `i + 2` to the first 'S' character encountered after `i + 1` or the end of the string.**
