To determine the output state after the given Python code snippet is executed, we analyze its impact on the variables provided in the initial state.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is 0.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 0.
- The character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'.

The given Python code snippet is:
```python
max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
```

This line of code compares the current value of `max_beauty` with `curr_beauty` and assigns the maximum of these two values back to `max_beauty`. 

Given that `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are both initially 0, the value of `max_beauty` will remain 0 after this operation because the maximum of 0 and 0 is 0.

Therefore, the states of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `left`, `right`, and the condition that the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S' remain unchanged. The value of `curr_beauty` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the operation.

The output state is: 
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is 0.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 0.
- The character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'.**
