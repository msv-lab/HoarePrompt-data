The given code snippet is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most inner loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `i` is greater than or equal to 2
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`
- `j` is `i - 2`
- if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2, otherwise, `beauty` is 1

The `break` statement does not modify any variables, it only changes the control flow of the program. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `i` is greater than or equal to 2
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`
- `j` is `i - 2`
- if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2, otherwise, `beauty` is 1
- and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 2`, if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2, otherwise, `beauty` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
