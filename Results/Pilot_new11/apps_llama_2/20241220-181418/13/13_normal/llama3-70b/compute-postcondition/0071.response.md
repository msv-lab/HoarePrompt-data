The given code is a `break` statement. This statement does not modify any variables but exits the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0
- `i` is greater than 2
- The current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G'
- The current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S'
- `j` is `i - 3`

After executing the `break` statement:
- All variable values remain unchanged because `break` only affects the flow of control, not the values of variables.
- The program exits the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 2, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `j` is `i - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
