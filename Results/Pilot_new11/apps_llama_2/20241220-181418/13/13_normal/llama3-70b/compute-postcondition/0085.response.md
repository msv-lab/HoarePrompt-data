The given Python code is `beauty += 1`. This means that the value of `beauty` is incremented by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this line of code. 

The Initial State of `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 3`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', `j` is `i + 4`. 

After executing the code, the value of `beauty` is incremented by 1, which can be written as `beauty + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 3`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', `j` is `i + 4`, `beauty` is `beauty + 1`**
