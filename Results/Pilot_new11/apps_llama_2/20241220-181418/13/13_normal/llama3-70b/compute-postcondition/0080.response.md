To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 2, n):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of indices from `i + 2` to `n-1` (since the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value).

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 2` and `s` at index `j` is 'S'. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is now `i + 2` and `s` at index `j` is 'S', the new value of `j` will be `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', `j` is `i + 3`**
