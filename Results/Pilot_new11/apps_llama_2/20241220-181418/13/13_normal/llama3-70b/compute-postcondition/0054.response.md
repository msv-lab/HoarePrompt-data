To calculate the result, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program. The code updates the value of `max_beauty` by taking the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. 

Since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, and `max_beauty` is the maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters in `s`, we can conclude that:

- The values of `n`, `s`, and `golden` remain unchanged.
- The value of `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, which represents the maximum length of consecutive 'G' characters in `s` so far.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.**
