Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the maximum achievable beauty of a sequence of golden ('G') and silver ('S') trophies, considering two scenarios: (1) the maximum consecutive length of 'G' trophies in the given sequence, and (2) the maximum length of consecutive 'G' trophies achievable by swapping a single 'G' trophy followed by an 'S' trophy with the adjacent 'S' trophy. The function takes no arguments but reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters from the input. The function does not modify the input variables but consumes them to calculate the maximum beauty. After execution, the function prints the maximum beauty between the two scenarios. The function handles edge cases where the input sequence is entirely composed of 'G' or 'S' trophies, as well as cases where the maximum beauty is achieved by swapping a 'G' trophy followed by an 'S' trophy.**
