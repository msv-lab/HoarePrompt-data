The code increments the value of `left` by 1. The initial state specifies that `left` is less than `right` and `s[left]` is not 'G'. After incrementing `left`, it is still less than `right` because the difference between `right` and `left` has decreased by 1, but `right` has not changed. 

Other variables such as `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty` do not change.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is `left + 1` and `left` is less than `right`.**
