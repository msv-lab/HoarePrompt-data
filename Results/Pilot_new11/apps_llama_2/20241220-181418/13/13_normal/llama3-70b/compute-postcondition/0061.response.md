The code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is 1, so after the increment, `beauty` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `beauty` is 2, `j` is `i - 1`, and the current value of `s` at index `j` is 'G'**
