The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, `beauty`, and `j` remain the same. The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `beauty` is 1, `j` is `i - 1`, the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
