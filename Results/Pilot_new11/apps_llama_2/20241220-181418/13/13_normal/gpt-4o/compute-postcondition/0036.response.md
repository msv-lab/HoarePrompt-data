The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `n` is greater than the new `i + 1`, `trophies` has 'G' at the next index to be checked, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `start` equals the new `i + 1`, after the code is executed, `i` will have been incremented by 1 again. The new value of `i` is `i + 1`, `start` will be equal to the new `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than the new `i + 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than the new `i + 1`, `trophies` has 'G' at the next index to be checked, `i` has been incremented by 1 again, and `start` equals the new `i + 1`.**
