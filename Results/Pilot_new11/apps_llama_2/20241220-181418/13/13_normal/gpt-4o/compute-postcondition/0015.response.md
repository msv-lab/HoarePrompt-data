Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S', if `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `i` is the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` if it exists and is within the bounds of `n`, otherwise `i` equals `n`, and `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 1)`. If `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `i` is 1 and `segments` remains an empty list.**
