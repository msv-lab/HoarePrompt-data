Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For instance, consider the case when the input is "SGGGGSG", the program should return 5 (swapping the first 'S' with the last 'S'), but the current program returns 4.

The problem with the current program is that it doesn't consider all potential swaps of two trophies to maximize the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. The current program only checks if the two segments of golden trophies can be merged by removing a single silver trophy between them, but it doesn't consider the case when a silver trophy is at the end or the beginning of the sequence and can be swapped with another silver trophy in the middle to increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies.

To fix this, the program should be modified to check all potential swaps of two trophies and calculate the maximum length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies after the swap. 

Additionally, the last line of the function `func_1(n, trophies)` is also incorrect, as it may return `max_length + 1` even if the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies is actually less than or equal to `max_length`. This could happen when there are no silver trophies that can be swapped to increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. 

Here's an example of how the function could be modified:

```python
def func_1(n, trophies):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            temp_trophies = list(trophies)
            temp_trophies[i], temp_trophies[j] = temp_trophies[j], temp_trophies[i]
            current_length = 0
            max_current_length = 0
            for k in range(n):
                if temp_trophies[k] == 'G':
                    current_length += 1
                    max_current_length = max(max_current_length, current_length)
                else:
                    current_length = 0
            max_length = max(max_length, max_current_length)
    return max_length
```
This function checks all possible swaps of two trophies, calculates the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies after the swap, and returns the maximum length found.
