The value of `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Therefore, `j - i - 1` equals 0. Since `max_erase` is initially 0, its value remains 0 after the update because the maximum of 0 and 0 is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than `i`. The current value of the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` is such that `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i` for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`.**
