Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), if all elements in `a` form a consecutive sequence, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, the current value of `i` is `n-1`, and the current value of `j` is `n`.**
