Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 101 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`, and if all elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2, otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged with `n`, `a`, `i`, and `j` retaining their initial values and relationships.**
