Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 101 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\) and has been extended by at least one element, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is an integer starting from `i + 1`, and the current value of the list `a` from index `i` to `j` has the property that the difference between any two elements at indices `k` and `i` is equal to the difference between their indices, i.e., `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`.**
