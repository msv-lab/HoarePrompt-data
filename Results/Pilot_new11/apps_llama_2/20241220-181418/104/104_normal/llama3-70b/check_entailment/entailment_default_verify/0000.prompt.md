You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as stated in the description. It only checks for sequences where the difference between all consecutive elements is 1 (i.e., arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 1), which is not the requirement of the problem.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array is [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21]. In this case, JATC can erase the elements at indices 1, 2, 3, and 4, leaving the array [1, 21], which can still be restored by Giraffe because he knows that all the elements are integers in the range [1, 10^3]. However, the provided program will not find this solution.

The program should instead check all possible subarrays and determine whether it's possible to restore the array after erasing the elements in the subarray. This can be done by checking if the difference between the element before the subarray and the first element of the subarray, and the difference between the last element of the subarray and the element after the subarray, can be used to uniquely restore the elements in the subarray. 

Here's an example of how the correct solution might look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            can_restore = True
            if i > 0 and j < n:
                diff = a[j] - a[i - 1] - (j - i)
                for k in range(i, j):
                    if a[k] - a[i - 1]!= k - i + diff:
                        can_restore = False
                        break
            elif i > 0:
                for k in range(i, j):
                    if a[k] > 1000:
                        can_restore = False
                        break
            elif j < n:
                if a[j] - a[i - 1] - (j - i) > 0:
                    can_restore = False
            if can_restore:
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)
```

This corrected version of the program checks all possible subarrays and determines whether it's possible to restore the array after erasing the elements in the subarray. If it is possible, it updates the maximum number of elements that can be erased.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two lines from standard input, where the first line contains a single integer `n` and the second line contains `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the length of the longest consecutive arithmetic subsequence in the input list minus one, effectively determining the maximum number of elements that can be removed from the list while maintaining an arithmetic sequence. The function handles lists of up to 100 integers, with each integer between 1 and 10^3. If the input list is not already sorted or does not contain unique integers, the function still processes it as is, but the result may not be meaningful unless the input list is sorted and contains unique integers. The function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input will be a positive integer `n` followed by `n` integers. After the function executes, the program state is such that the maximum number of removable elements from the longest consecutive arithmetic subsequence has been printed to standard output, and no changes have been made to the input list or any other external state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
