The code `a = b ^ x` assigns the value of the bitwise XOR operation between `b` and `x` to `a`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `b`, only `s` and `x`. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific value for `a` without knowing `b`.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 2 <= `s` <= 10^12, `x` is an integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 10^12, `a` is equal to `b` ^ `x`**
