The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, so the output state is: `s` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, `a` is 3, `b` is `s - 3`, `count` is the previous state of `count` plus 1.

Output State: **`s` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, `a` is 3, `b` is `s - 3`, `count` is the previous state of `count` + 1**
