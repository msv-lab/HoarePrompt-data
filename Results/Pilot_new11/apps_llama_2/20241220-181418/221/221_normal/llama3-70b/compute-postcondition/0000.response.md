The code `s, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them into two variables `s` and `x`, and assigns them the values of these two integers. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes an input string, splits it into two parts (assuming it is separated by a space), and converts these parts into integers.

Since `s` and `x` are assigned the values from the input, their initial state constraints (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12) may not hold after the assignment, as the input values can be any integers.

However, considering the new assignment, the constraints depend on the actual input provided. Thus, after executing the code:

- `s` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.

Given that the initial constraints may not apply due to the nature of the input, and without knowing the exact input values, we cannot specify the exact range or values of `s` and `x` beyond being integers assigned from the input.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
