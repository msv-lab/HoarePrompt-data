The value of `b` is assigned as `z // i * x`. Given that `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, and `a` is `3 * x`, we can substitute these values into the expression for `b`. 

Since `z` equals `y // x` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is an integer. Given that `z` is at least 9 and `i` is 3, `z // i` will be the integer division of `z` by 3. 

So, `b` equals `z // i * x` which is `(y // x) // 3 * x`. Simplifying this, `b` equals `(y // (3 * x)) * x`. 

Given that `a` equals `3 * x`, we can further simplify `b` to `y // a * x` or `(y // (3 * x)) * x`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`, and `b` equals `(y // (3 * x)) * x` or `(y // a) * x`.

Output State: **`l`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`, and `b` equals `(y // (3 * x)) * x` or `(y // a) * x`**
