To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9.
- `y` is divisible by `x`.
- `z` is an integer equal to `y // x` and is at least 1.
- `z` is divisible by `i`.
- `i` is 1.
- `count` is 0.
- `a` is equal to `x`.

Given the equation `b = z // i * x`, let's break it down:
- Since `i` is 1, `z // i` equals `z`.
- Therefore, `b = z * x`.
- Since `z = y // x`, we can substitute `z` in the equation for `b` to get `b = (y // x) * x`.
- Because `y` is divisible by `x`, `y // x` is an integer, and when multiplied by `x`, it equals `y`. Thus, `b = y`.

The states of `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `i`, `count`, and `a` do not change with the introduction of `b`, except that now we have an additional variable `b` which is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is an integer equal to `y // x` and is at least 1, `z` is divisible by `i`, `i` is 1, `count` is 0, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to `y`.**
