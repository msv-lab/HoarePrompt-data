The code assigns the value of `i` multiplied by `x` to the variable `a`. The value of `i` is 3, so `a` is assigned the value `3 * x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`.

Output State: **`l`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`**
