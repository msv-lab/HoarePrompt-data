To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given code and the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The code of the loop is:
```python
while b:
    a, b = b, a % b
```
This is a implementation of the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can see that:

- After 1 iteration, `a` becomes the original `b` and `b` becomes `a % b`.
- After 2 iterations, `a` becomes the old `b` (which is the original `b`) and `b` becomes the new `a` modulo the old `b` (which is `a % b`).
- After 3 iterations, `a` becomes the old `b` (which is `a % b`) and `b` becomes the new `a` modulo the old `a` (which is `b`).

We can notice that the loop continues to update `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0. At this point, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

So, after all the iterations of the loop have executed, the output state is:

- `b` is 0, because the loop continues until `b` becomes 0.
- `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, because the Euclidean algorithm is used to find the GCD.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`**
