To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state tells us that `a` and `b` are positive integers. 

The code snippet is `return a * b // func_1(a, b)`. 

Here, `a * b` will result in the product of `a` and `b`, which will be a positive integer since both `a` and `b` are positive integers.

However, the function `func_1(a, b)` is not defined in the given information, which means we cannot directly calculate its return value. 

Given the operation `//`, which is integer division in Python, the result of `a * b // func_1(a, b)` will be the integer part of the division of `a * b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

Since we do not know what `func_1(a, b)` returns, we cannot calculate the exact result of `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. But we can say that the program returns the integer result of the division of the product of two positive integers `a` and `b` by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.

Output State: **The program returns the integer result of (a * b) divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are positive integers.**
