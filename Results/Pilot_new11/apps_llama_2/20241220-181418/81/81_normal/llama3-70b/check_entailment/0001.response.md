Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It only defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the GCD and LCM of two numbers, respectively. However, it does not contain any code to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible pairs of integers (a, b) in the range [l, r] and checking if their GCD is x and LCM is y. If such a pair is found, it should be counted.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: if we input l = 1, r = 10, x = 2, and y = 6, the program should return the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions. However, the given program does not contain any code to perform this calculation.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to add a function that takes the input values l, r, x, and y, and returns the count of good pairs. Here is a simple example of how this could be implemented:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)

def count_good_pairs(l, r, x, y):
    count = 0
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(l, r + 1):
            if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
                count += 1
    return count

l, r, x, y = map(int, input().split())
print(count_good_pairs(l, r, x, y))
```

This code defines a new function `count_good_pairs` that iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) in the range [l, r] and checks if their GCD is x and LCM is y. If such a pair is found, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of good pairs.
