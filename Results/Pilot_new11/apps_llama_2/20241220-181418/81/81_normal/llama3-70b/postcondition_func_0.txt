The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b`. It accepts two parameters and returns a single value, which is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. The return value is determined after the function execution, and it does not return the original value of `a` as suggested by the annotation, but rather the GCD of `a` and `b` that is calculated through the Euclidean algorithm implemented in the while loop. The final state of the program is that it returns an integer value representing the GCD of the input integers `a` and `b`, handling all potential edge cases including when `b` is 0 from the start, in which case it returns `a` as the GCD.
