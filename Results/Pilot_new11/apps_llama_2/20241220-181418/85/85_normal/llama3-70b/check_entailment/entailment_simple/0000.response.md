Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the condition used to check if the sum of the costs of two shovels ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

The current condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` is checking if the sum of `i` and `(n - i)` is a multiple of 10 to the power of the number of digits in the sum minus 1. This does not necessarily correspond to the sum ending with the maximum possible number of nines.

The problem description requires finding pairs of shovels such that the sum of their costs ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The condition should be checking for the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of `i` and `n-i`, not just checking for divisibility by a certain power of 10.

Furthermore, the program does not correctly consider all pairs of shovels. It only checks pairs where one shovel's cost is `i` and the other's cost is `n-i`. This does not cover all possible pairs of shovels that Polycarp can choose from.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs of shovels, calculating the sum of their costs, and checking the number of trailing nines in this sum. The pair with the maximum number of trailing nines should be found, and then all pairs with this maximum number of trailing nines should be counted.

Here is an example of a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    ans = 0

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            sum_ij = i + j
            nines = 0
            while sum_ij % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                sum_ij //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                ans = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                ans += 1

    print(ans)
```

This corrected function iterates over all possible pairs of shovels, calculates the sum of their costs, and checks the number of trailing nines in this sum. It keeps track of the maximum number of trailing nines found so far and counts the number of pairs with this maximum number of trailing nines.
