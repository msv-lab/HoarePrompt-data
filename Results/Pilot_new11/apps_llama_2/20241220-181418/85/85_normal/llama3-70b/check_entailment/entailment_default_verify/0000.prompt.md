You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it is only checking pairs where the first shovel has a cost less than or equal to half of the total cost of the pair. However, this is not sufficient to cover all cases. The program should be checking all possible pairs of shovels, not just those that satisfy this condition.

For example, consider the case where `n = 10`. In this case, the pair `(5, 5)` should be counted, because the sum of their costs is `10`, which ends with a `0`. However, the program will not count this pair, because `5` is equal to half of the total cost of the pair, and the program only checks pairs where the first shovel has a cost strictly less than half of the total cost.

Another issue with the program is that it is using `len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1` to calculate the number of digits in the sum of the costs, which is not correct. This will not work correctly for all cases, especially for large values of `n`.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels, calculate the sum of their costs, and check if it ends with the maximum possible number of nines. If it does, increment the count of pairs.

Here's an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    max_nines = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            sum_costs = i + j
            nines = 0
            while sum_costs % 10 == 9:
                sum_costs //= 10
                nines += 1
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                ans = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer input from the user, where the input is expected to be a positive integer greater than 1, representing the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop. The function then counts and returns the number of integers from 1 to half of the input integer (inclusive) for which the sum of the integer and its difference from the input integer is a multiple of 10 raised to the power of the number of digits in the sum minus 1. The function prints the count as its output, but does not return it. The state of the program after execution is that the input integer and the count are stored in memory, but only the count is printed to the console. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a positive integer greater than 1, and it assumes that the input is a valid integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
