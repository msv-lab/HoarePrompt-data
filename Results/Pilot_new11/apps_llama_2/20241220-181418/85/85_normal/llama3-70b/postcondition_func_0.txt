The function accepts an integer input from the user, where the input is expected to be a positive integer greater than 1, representing the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop. The function then counts and returns the number of integers from 1 to half of the input integer (inclusive) for which the sum of the integer and its difference from the input integer is a multiple of 10 raised to the power of the number of digits in the sum minus 1. The function prints the count as its output, but does not return it. The state of the program after execution is that the input integer and the count are stored in memory, but only the count is printed to the console. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a positive integer greater than 1, and it assumes that the input is a valid integer.
