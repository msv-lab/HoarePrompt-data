Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of shovels that have the maximum possible number of nines at the end of their total cost. 

Let's consider an example where n = 7. The maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. The pairs of shovels that suit this condition are (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5). 

The program seems to incorrectly calculate the number of pairs by simply multiplying the number of digits in n by the number of nines at the end of n + 1. This approach does not consider all possible pairs of shovels and their total costs.

For instance, in the case where n = 7, the program does not correctly identify the pairs (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5) as the pairs with the maximum possible number of nines at the end of their total cost.

The program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the total cost of all possible pairs of shovels and then count the number of pairs with the maximum possible number of nines at the end of their total cost. 

Here is a possible correct implementation in Python:
```python
def count_pairs(n):
    max_nines = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                count = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(count_pairs(n))
```
