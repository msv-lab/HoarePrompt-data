Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of trailing nines that can be achieved by adding up the costs of two shovels. This can be done by checking all possible pairs of shovels and finding the maximum number of trailing nines.

The given program does not consider all possible pairs of shovels. Instead, it simply counts the number of trailing nines in the number `n` and multiplies it by `n + 1`. This approach does not accurately solve the problem.

For example, consider the input `n = 7`. The maximum number of trailing nines that can be achieved by adding up the costs of two shovels is 1, which is achieved by the pairs `(2, 7)`, `(3, 6)`, and `(4, 5)`. However, the given program does not correctly identify these pairs and instead outputs an incorrect result.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to write a program that checks all possible pairs of shovels and finds the maximum number of trailing nines. We can then count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum number of trailing nines. 

Here is a correct Python solution for the problem:
```python
def count_pairs(n):
    max_nines = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                count = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(count_pairs(n))
```
This program correctly solves the problem by checking all possible pairs of shovels and finding the maximum number of trailing nines. It then counts the number of pairs that achieve this maximum number of trailing nines and prints the result.
