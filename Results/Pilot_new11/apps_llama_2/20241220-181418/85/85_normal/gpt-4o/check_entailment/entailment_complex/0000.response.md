Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it only counts the number of trailing 9s in the input number `n` and multiplies it by `n + 1`. However, the problem description asks for the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

The program does not consider the actual cost of the shovels, which is the key factor in determining the number of pairs that meet the condition. The cost of the shovels is determined by their index, i.e., the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, and so on. The program does not take this into account and therefore does not provide the correct solution to the problem.

For example, if `n` is 50, the program will count the number of trailing 9s in 50, which is 0, and multiply it by 51, which is 0. However, the correct solution is 1, because there is only one pair of shovels (49 and 50) whose total cost (49 + 50 = 99) ends with the maximum possible number of nines (2).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
