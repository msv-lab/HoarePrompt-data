Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The problem asks to find the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines, where the cost of the i-th shovel is i burles.

The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible number of nines by counting the trailing nines in the number `n`, which represents the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual costs of the shovels and how they can be paired to achieve the maximum number of trailing nines.

For example, if `n` is 7, the program will calculate `max_9s` as 0 and `n` as 7. Then, it will calculate `pairs` as `(7 + 1) * 0 = 0`, which is incorrect because the correct answer is 3, as explained in the problem description (pairs: 2 and 7, 3 and 6, 4 and 5).

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs of shovels, calculating their total cost, and counting the number of pairs that achieve the maximum possible number of trailing nines. However, the given program does not implement this approach, and therefore, it does not correctly solve the problem. 

Here is a simple example of a correct program in python. This program checks every possible pair of numbers and returns the maximum number of nines at the end and how many such pairs there are:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    max_pairs = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            total = i + j
            local_9s = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                local_9s += 1
                total //= 10
            if local_9s > max_9s:
                max_9s = local_9s
                max_pairs = 1
            elif local_9s == max_9s:
                max_pairs += 1

    print(max_pairs)
```
This program has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is inefficient for large inputs. However, it demonstrates the correct approach to solving the problem. A more efficient solution would involve using a different algorithm or data structure to reduce the time complexity.
