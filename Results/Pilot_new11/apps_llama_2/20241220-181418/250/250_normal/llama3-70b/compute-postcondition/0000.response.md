The code `n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` based on the input provided. 

The new values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are input integers. 

Since the initial state specified that `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that `1 <= x < y <= l`, and the input sequence `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` is an increasing sequence of integers where `a_1 = 0` and `a_{n} = l`, these conditions are updated as follows:

- The condition that `n` is a positive integer is updated to `n` is an input integer.
- The condition that `l` is a positive integer is updated to `l` is an input integer.
- The condition that `x` and `y` are positive integers such that `1 <= x < y <= l` is updated to `x` and `y` are input integers.
- The condition that the input sequence `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` is an increasing sequence of integers where `a_1 = 0` and `a_{n} = l` is no longer valid since the values of `n` and `l` have been changed.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers**
