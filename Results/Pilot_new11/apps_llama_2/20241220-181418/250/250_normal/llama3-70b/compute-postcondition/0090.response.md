Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` includes `i + j` and has at least one more element to process, and the next element in `additional_marks` is different from `j`.**
