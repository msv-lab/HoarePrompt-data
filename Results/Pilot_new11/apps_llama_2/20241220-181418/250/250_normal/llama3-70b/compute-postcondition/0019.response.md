To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2,
- `l` is an input integer,
- `x` is an input integer,
- `y` is an input integer,
- `marks` is a set of input integers,
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is 2,
- If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True, otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

The given code is:
```python
need_y = True
```
This code simply assigns `True` to the variable `need_y`.

Impact of the code:
- `need_y` is now `True`.
- Other variables' states remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True, `need_y` is True**
