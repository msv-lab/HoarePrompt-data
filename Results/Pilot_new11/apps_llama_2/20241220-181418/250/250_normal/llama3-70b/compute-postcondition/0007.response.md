Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, if the difference between the value of `marks` at index `j` and the value of `marks` at index `i` is equal to `x`, then `need_x` is True and `need_y` is False, otherwise `need_x` and `need_y` remain unchanged as False.**
