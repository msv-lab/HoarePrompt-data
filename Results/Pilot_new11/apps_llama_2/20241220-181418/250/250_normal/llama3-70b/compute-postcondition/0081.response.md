According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, and `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`. 

So for the loop to be executed, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element and `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` is a set of integers that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`**
