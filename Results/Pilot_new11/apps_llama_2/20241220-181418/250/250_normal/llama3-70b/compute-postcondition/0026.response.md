Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, initially `i` was 1, initially `j` was 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`. If there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == x`, then the current value of `j` is such that `marks[j] - marks[1] == x`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
