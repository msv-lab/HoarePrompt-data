According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If the set has at least one more element to process, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `additional_marks` has at least one more element to process, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element to process after the current `j`, and `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` has at least one more element to process, `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`**
