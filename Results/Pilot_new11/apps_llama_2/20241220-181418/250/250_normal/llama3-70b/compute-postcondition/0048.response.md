Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, then `need_y` is True. Regardless of the condition, `need_x` is True if `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` in `marks` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == y`.***
