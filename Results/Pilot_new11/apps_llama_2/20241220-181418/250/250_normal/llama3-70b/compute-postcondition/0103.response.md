To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the provided output states after a few iterations.

The loop code checks if the sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l` and if the sum is not in `marks`. If both conditions are met, it appends the sum to `additional_marks`.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged throughout the loop iterations.
- `marks` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations.
- `i` seems to be related to the elements in `marks`, but its specific value after the loop is not directly determined by the loop code provided. It's more about the iteration process than the final state.
- `need_x` and `need_y` do not change within the provided loop code.
- `additional_marks` is updated with new sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`.

Given the nature of the loop, which continues until all elements in `additional_marks` have been processed (and potentially new elements added), the final state of `additional_marks` will include all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`. This is because each iteration potentially adds new elements to `additional_marks` if the conditions are met, and this process repeats until no more new elements can be added.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `additional_marks` will contain a comprehensive set of sums that meet the specified conditions, derived from both the original `marks` and the sums found within `additional_marks` itself.

Considering the variables and their transformations:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks` remain unchanged.
- `need_x` and `need_y` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `additional_marks` is updated to include all possible sums not exceeding `l` and not present in `marks`, derived from both the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks`.
- The loop's execution does not directly depend on `i`'s final value but rather on the elements of `additional_marks` being processed.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, and `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`.**
