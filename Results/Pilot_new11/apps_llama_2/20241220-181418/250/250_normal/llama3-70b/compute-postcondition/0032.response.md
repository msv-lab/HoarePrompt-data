Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 1. If there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `j` being considered for the next index, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. If no such `j` exists for `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `j` being considered for the next index, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`.***
