Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 1, if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, then `j` is such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True`. If no such `j` exists, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `j` being 1, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` where `marks[j] - marks[0] == y`.***
