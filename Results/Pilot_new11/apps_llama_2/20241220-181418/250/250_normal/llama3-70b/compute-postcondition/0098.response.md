The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` set. 

`i` is the next element in `marks` after the current one and `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`. The value of `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that must have at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks` after the current one, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, including the new sum `i + j`, and has at least one more element, and `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`.**
