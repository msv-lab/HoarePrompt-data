To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we should analyze the loop condition and the changes that occur at the end of each iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in additional_marks:
    # the loop body is omitted
```
The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `additional_marks` to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer (no change needed).
- `l` is an input integer (no change needed).
- `x` is an input integer (no change needed).
- `y` is an input integer (no change needed).
- `marks` is a non-empty set of input integers (its state could have been updated if a new mark was added, but this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is an element in `marks` (its state could change if the loop body affects it, but based on the information given, `i`'s state change is not directly related to the loop's continuation condition).
- `need_x` is False (no change needed based on the loop condition).
- `need_y` is either False or True, but if True, then `need_x` must be False (no change needed based on the loop condition).
- `additional_marks` has been updated if there exists an element `j` in `additional_marks` such that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`. For the loop to execute again, `additional_marks` must not be empty after the update.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `additional_marks` to iterate over. Given the information, if an `i + j` was added to `marks` and possibly to `additional_marks` under certain conditions, the critical adjustment is ensuring `additional_marks` is not empty and accurately reflecting the elements that can be iterated over in the next step.

However, the precise adjustments to the states of `i`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and the composition of `marks` and `additional_marks` depend on the specific operations performed within the loop body, which is not provided. The key factor for the loop to continue is the presence of more elements in `additional_marks`.

Given this analysis, and focusing strictly on the conditions for the loop to execute again without assuming specifics of the loop body:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` may have been updated with new elements, `i` may refer to a different element in the updated `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either False or True but if True then `need_x` must be False, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element to iterate over**
