The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds the sum of `i` and `j` to the end of the list `additional_marks`. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `i`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and the fact that `i` is an element in `marks` and `j` is an element in `additional_marks` are not affected by this operation. However, the list `additional_marks` is updated with a new element which is `i + j`. The condition that `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not an element in `marks` still holds for the previous values of `i` and `j`, but now `i + j` is an element in `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a non-empty set of input integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either False or True but if True then `need_x` must be False, `additional_marks` is a non-empty list that includes `i + j` where `i` is an element in `marks` and `j` is an element in the previous state of `additional_marks` and `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and was not an element in `marks`, `j` is an element in `additional_marks`.**
