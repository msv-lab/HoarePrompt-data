According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If `additional_marks` has at least one more element to process, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` has elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next element in `additional_marks`. Since the previous iteration has been completed, the current `j` is no longer the first element in `additional_marks`. Therefore, `j` should be the next element in `additional_marks`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers with at least one more element to process, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` has at least one more element to process, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`**
