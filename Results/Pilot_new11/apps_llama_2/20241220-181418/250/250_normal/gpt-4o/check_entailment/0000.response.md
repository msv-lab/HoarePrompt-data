Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to handle all possible cases as described in the problem description. It first checks if the distances x and y can be measured using the existing marks on the ruler. If both x and y can be measured, it outputs 0 and does not add any new marks. If either x or y cannot be measured, it attempts to find a new mark that can be added to measure both x and y. If such a mark is found, it outputs 1 and the new mark. If no such mark is found, it outputs 2 and the distances x and y as the new marks.

The program handles all edge cases, including when the input distances x and y are already measurable using the existing marks, and when the input distances x and y are not measurable using the existing marks but can be made measurable by adding one or two new marks.

After careful review, no potential case was found where the program does not follow the problem description. The examples provided in the problem statement also work as expected with the given program.

However, one should note that the code could be optimized and improved for better readability and performance. But in terms of correctness, it appears to handle all cases as specified. 

To further prove the correctness of this code, more test cases could be run on it. Also, a formal proof of correctness could be provided, which would involve showing that the code works as expected for all possible inputs. But based on the provided code and problem description, the code appears to be correct.
