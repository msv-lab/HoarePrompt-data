The code snippet provided is `print(len(result))`, which prints the length of the `result` list. 

Since `result` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y` ([x, y]), and no changes are made to the list, the length of `result` remains the same, which is 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), 
`l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), 
`x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), 
`y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), 
`marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), 
`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, 
`new_marks` is an empty set, 
if `y_found` is False, then `x_found` is False, 
`result` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y` ([x, y]), 
the value 2 has been printed, and 
`x_found` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is an empty set, if `y_found` is False, then `x_found` is False, `result` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y` ([x, y]), the value 2 has been printed, and `x_found` remains unchanged.**
