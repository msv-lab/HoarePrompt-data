The line of code `new_marks.add(mark - x)` adds the value of `mark - x` to the set `new_marks`. 

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, the current value of `x_found` is False, `y_found` indicates whether a mark plus or minus `y` exists in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, neither `mark + x + y`, nor `mark + x - y` exists in `marks_set`, and `mark` is the first mark in `marks`. The current value of `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or the current value of `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`.

The value of `new_marks` changes to include `mark - x`, while the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` indicates whether a mark plus or minus `y` exists in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x`, neither `mark + x + y`, nor `mark + x - y` exists in `marks_set`, and `mark` is the first mark in `marks`. The current value of `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set` or the current value of `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`.**
