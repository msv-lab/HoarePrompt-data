Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. If `mark + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True` and `y_found` is `False`. If `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is `True` and the value of `x_found` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged.***
