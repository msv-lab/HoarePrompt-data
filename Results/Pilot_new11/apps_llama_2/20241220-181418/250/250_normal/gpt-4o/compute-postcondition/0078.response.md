The code `print(new_marks.pop())` removes and returns an arbitrary element from the `new_marks` set. After this operation, the size of `new_marks` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is a non-empty set containing one less value than before, and the value returned is an element that was in `new_marks` before the pop operation, which is either `mark + x`, `mark - x`, `mark + y`, or `mark - y` for some `mark` in `marks`.**
