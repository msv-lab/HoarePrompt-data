Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. The current value of `y_found` is False, indicating that a mark plus or minus `y` does not exist in `marks_set` before this condition, and the state of `x_found` is unchanged. The current value of `new_marks` is an empty set if `x_found` is False. For at least one mark in `marks`, either `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` exists in `marks_set`, meaning that there is a mark in `marks` such that adding or subtracting `y` and then adding or subtracting `x` results in another mark in `marks`.**
