According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least 3 marks, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least 2 marks, `mark` is the second mark in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 marks and the `mark` is the third mark in the list. Other variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks_set` do not affect the loop execution directly, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`. If `y` is not found, then if `mark + y + x`, `mark + y - x`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains at least `marks[2] + y`. If none of these values are in `marks_set`, then if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains at least `marks[2] - y`. Otherwise, if `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains `marks[2] + x`. If none of these initial conditions are met and `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least `marks[2] - x`.**
