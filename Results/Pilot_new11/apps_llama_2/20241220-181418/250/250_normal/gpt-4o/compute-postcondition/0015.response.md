To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l)
- `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l)
- `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks
- `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`

The loop iterates over each `mark` in `marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, it must not have reached the end of the `marks` list yet.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- We don't know the exact values of `x_found` and `y_found` as they depend on the loop body which is omitted. However, we're looking at the iteration process of the loop itself.
- Since `marks` has at least 2 marks and we're iterating through it, for the loop to execute again, we must not be at the last mark.

Adjusting states:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are input integers not affected by the loop iteration directly in the context given.
- `marks` is being iterated, so the current `mark` is advancing to the next one in the list.
- `marks_set` remains the same as it's a set derived from `marks`, and the iteration doesn't inherently change the set of unique marks.

Considering the loop must execute one more time, it implies that we are not yet at the last element of `marks`. Thus, the state adjustment focuses on the position within `marks`.

State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, and we are at the next mark in the sequence.**
