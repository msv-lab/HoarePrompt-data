`new_marks` is updated to include the value `mark + y`. The value of `mark` is `marks[1]`, which is the second mark in the `marks` list. Since `y` is an input integer (`x < y ≤ l`), `mark + y` equals `marks[1] + y`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`, and `new_marks` contains at least `marks[1] + y`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is `marks[1]`, and `new_marks` contains at least `marks[1] + y`**
