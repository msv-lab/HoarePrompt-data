The given code increments the value of `final_y` by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to the length of `operations` after one more removal, `operations` is a string of length `n-1` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `final_y` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to the length of `operations` after one more removal, `operations` is a string of length `n-1` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_y` is `final_y + 1`**
