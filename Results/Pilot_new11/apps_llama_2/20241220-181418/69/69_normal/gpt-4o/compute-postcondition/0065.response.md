Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is either its initial value of positive infinity or the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions, initially {(0, 0): -1}, `i` is 0, `current_x` and `current_y` are determined by `operations[i]`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both***
