Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `i` is 2. If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_x` remains the same, `current_y` is decreased by 1, `target_pos` is (`current_x + x - final_x`, `current_y - 1 + y - final_y`), `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions, initially {(0, 0): -1} and also includes (`current_x`, `current_y - 1`): `2` and all other previously computed positions, `min_length` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, otherwise its initial value of positive infinity. If `operations[i]` is not 'D', then: if `operations[i]` is 'L', `current_x` is `current_x - 1`, `current_y` is determined by `operations[2]`, `target_pos` is (`(current_x - 1) + x - final_x`, `current_y + y - final_y`), `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions including (`current_x - 1`, `current_y`): potentially updated and all other previously computed positions; if `operations[i]` is 'R', `current_x` is `current_x + 1`, `current_y` is determined by `operations[2]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x + 1 + x - final_x`, `current_y + y - final_y`), `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions, initially {(0, 0): -1} and also includes (`current_x + 1`, `current_y`): unknown value and all other previously computed positions; for any other `operations[i]`, the state remains unchanged. In all cases, `min_length` is the minimum of its previous value and `2 - position_map[target_pos]` if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, otherwise its initial value of positive infinity.**
