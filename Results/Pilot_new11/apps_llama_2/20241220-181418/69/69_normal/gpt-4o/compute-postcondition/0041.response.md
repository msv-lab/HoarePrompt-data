Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, and `dy` is `y - final_y`. Either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both.**
