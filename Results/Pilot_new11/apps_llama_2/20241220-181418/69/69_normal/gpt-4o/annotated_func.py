#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and returns the minimum distance between revisits to a target position determined by the given parameters `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. It accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), and `x` and `y` (integers). The function first calculates the final position (`final_x` and `final_y`) after all operations in `operations` are executed. If this final position matches the target position (`x`, `y`), the function returns
