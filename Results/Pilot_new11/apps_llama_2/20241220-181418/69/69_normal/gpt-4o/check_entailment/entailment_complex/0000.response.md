Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It calculates the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed in the given sequence of operations to move the robot from (0, 0) to (x, y).

The program first calculates the final position of the robot after executing all the operations in the sequence. If this final position matches the target position (x, y), the program returns 0, indicating that no changes are needed.

If the final position does not match the target position, the program iterates through the sequence of operations and keeps track of the visited positions and their indices. For each position, it calculates the target position by adding the differences between the target coordinates and the final coordinates to the current position. If this target position has been visited before, the program updates the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed.

The program returns the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed, or -1 if it is impossible to reach the target position.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases. It correctly handles the cases where the target position is reachable or unreachable, and it returns the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed or -1 accordingly.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and meets the requirements specified. It is a correct implementation of the problem.
