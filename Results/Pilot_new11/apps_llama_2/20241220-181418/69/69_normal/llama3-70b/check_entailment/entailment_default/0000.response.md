Correctness: **False**

The code does not do what the problem description says for every potential case. The problem description asks for the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed so that the robot will go from (0, 0) to (x, y). However, the code does not find this minimum length. 

For example, if the input is 
5
RURUU
-2 3

The code will output 2, but the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed is indeed 3 as given in the problem statement. 

This happens because the code simply counts the number of operations that are not necessary to reach the target position, which is not the same as finding the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed.

To find the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed, we need to find the minimum length of subsegment such that changing it can make the robot reach the target position. This requires a more complex algorithm, such as checking all possible subsegments and finding the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed.

The code provided does not implement this algorithm correctly, and therefore, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
