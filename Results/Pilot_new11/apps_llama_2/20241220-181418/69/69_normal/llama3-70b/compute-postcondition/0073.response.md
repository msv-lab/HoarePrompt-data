The code `dy -= 1` decreases the value of `dy` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `dy`, but it does provide information about `ly` and `uy` which are related to `y`. Since `dy` is not directly mentioned in the initial state, we can infer that `dy` is likely related to the change in `y`. 

Given that `ly` is 0, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, and we are at the next operation in the string, the value of `dy` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, `dy` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, and we are at the next operation in the string**
