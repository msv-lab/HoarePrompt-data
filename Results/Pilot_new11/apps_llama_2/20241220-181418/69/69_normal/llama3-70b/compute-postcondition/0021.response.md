There seems to be a variable `uy` that is not defined in the initial state. However, based on the given initial state and the code, I will provide the output state.

The code `uy += 1` increments the value of `uy` by 1, but since `uy` is not defined in the initial state, let's assume it's a typo and it should be `ly` (as `ly` is defined in the initial state and `uy` is not).

If that's the case, the value of `ly` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 1, `op` is the second character of `ops`**
