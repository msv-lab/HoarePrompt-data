Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the first character of `ops` is 'U', then `lx` is 0, `ly` is 1, and `y` is increased by 1. If the first character of `ops` is 'D', then `lx` is 0, `ly` is -1, and `y` is decreased by 1. If the first character of `ops` is 'R', then `lx` is 1, `ly` is 0, and `x` is increased by 1. If the first character of `ops` is 'L', then `lx` is -1, `ly` is 0, and `x` is decreased by 1. For any other first character of `ops`, `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged from their initial values of 0.***
