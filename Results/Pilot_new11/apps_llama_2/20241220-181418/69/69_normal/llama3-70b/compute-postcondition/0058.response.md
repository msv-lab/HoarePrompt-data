Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is `x - ux + 1` and is less than 0, `dy` is `y - uy` and is greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is 0. Otherwise, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0, `res` is 1, and the specific conditions regarding `op`, `dx`, and `dy` are maintained as per their initial definitions, ensuring that `op` is not 'U' or `dy` is 0, `op` is not 'D' or `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, and `op` is not 'R' or `dx` is 0, and also `op` is not 'L' or `dx` is greater than or equal to 0.***
