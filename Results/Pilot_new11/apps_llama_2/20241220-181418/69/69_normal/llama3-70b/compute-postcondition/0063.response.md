To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is `dy -= 1`, which means the value of `dy` is decremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `lx` is 0
- `ly` is 0
- `ux` is updated based on the last operation
- `uy` is updated based on the last operation
- `dx` and `dy` are recalculated

After executing `dy -= 1`, the value of `dy` decreases by 1. Since the exact initial value of `dy` is not provided, we can only express its new value as `dy - 1` or equivalently, its previous value minus 1.

The other variables (`n`, `ops`, `x`, `y`, `lx`, `ly`, `ux`, `uy`, and `dx`) are not directly affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `lx` is 0
- `ly` is 0
- `ux` is updated based on the last operation
- `uy` is updated based on the last operation
- `dx` is recalculated
- `dy` is its previous value minus 1

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, `dx` is recalculated, `dy` is `dy - 1`.**
