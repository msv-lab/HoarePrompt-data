Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0, `res` is 0, `op` is the first operation in `ops`, and either `op` is not 'U' or `dy` is 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, meaning either `op` is not 'D' or `dy` is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `op` is 'R' and the current value of `dx` is greater than 0.**
