The value of `dy` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `dy` is not specified, so the output state is: `dy` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, `dx` and `dy` are recalculated, and `dy` is `dy + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, `dx` and `dy` are recalculated, and `dy` is increased by 1**
