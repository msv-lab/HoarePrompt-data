Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the second character of `ops` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1. If the second character of `ops` is 'L', then `lx` is -1 and `ly` is 0. For any other second character of `ops`, the state of `lx` and `ly` remains unchanged from their initial values of 0.***
