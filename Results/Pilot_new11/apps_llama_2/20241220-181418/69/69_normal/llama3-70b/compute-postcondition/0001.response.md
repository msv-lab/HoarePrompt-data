The code `ops = input()` assigns the value of `input()` to `ops`. `input()` accepts a string input from the user. In this case, it's described that the sequence is a string of `n` characters from 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'. However, the input operation here doesn't specify any constraint on the input, so `ops` is assigned the value of this input string.

Given that `n` is an input integer and it's mentioned that the sequence is of `n` characters, it can be inferred that the input string `ops` should be of length `n` and contains characters from 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'. But based on the code provided, there's no runtime validation that the length of `ops` must be `n` or that it only contains the specified characters.

The states of `x` and `y` are not affected by this operation. They remain integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` and `y` are integers**
