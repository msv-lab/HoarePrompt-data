The given code `dx -= 1` decrements the value of `dx` by 1. The previous value of `dx` is not specified, but it is mentioned that `dx` is recalculated. 

Since `dx` is decremented by 1, its new value will be `dx - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an input integer
- `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `lx` is 0
- `ly` is 0
- `ux` is updated based on the last operation
- `uy` is updated based on the last operation
- `dx` and `dy` are recalculated

The only change is to `dx`, which becomes `dx - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, `dx` is `dx - 1`, `dy` is recalculated**
