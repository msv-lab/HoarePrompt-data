Functionality: **The function `func_1` calculates the minimum achievable cost to achieve a target value `L` by iteratively subtracting powers of 2, considering a list of costs `costs` for each power of 2, and returns this minimum cost. It accepts parameters `n`, which is the number of costs provided, `L`, the target value, and `costs`, a list of costs for each power of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(n-1). The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost for each power of 2, considering both the cost of using the power of 2 directly and the cost of achieving it by doubling the previous power of 2. The function then iterates over the powers of 2 in descending order, subtracting the largest possible power of 2 from `L` at each step, and updates the minimum cost accordingly. The function handles cases where `L` is greater than or equal to the maximum possible power of 2, and also handles cases where `L` is less than the minimum possible power of 2. The function returns the minimum achievable cost as an integer value.**
