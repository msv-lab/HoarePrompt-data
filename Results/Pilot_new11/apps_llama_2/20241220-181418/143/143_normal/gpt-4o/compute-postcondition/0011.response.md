The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. The value of `i` is 1, so `dp[1]` is updated. The previous value of `dp[1]` is `costs[0]` (because `dp` is initialized with the elements of `costs` for the first `n` elements), and the value of `dp[0]` is `costs[0]` (because `dp` is initialized with the elements of `costs` for the first `n` elements).

Therefore, `dp[1]` becomes the minimum of `costs[0]` and `costs[0] * 2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where the first element is `min(costs[0], costs[0] * 2)` and the second element is `min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2)` if n is greater than 1 and `dp[0]` is `costs[0]`, and the remaining elements are the same as before, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), and `i` is 1**
