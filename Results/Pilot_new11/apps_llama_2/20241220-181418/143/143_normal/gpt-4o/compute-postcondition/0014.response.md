To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, 31):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 31. 

Given the current state: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30
- `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9
- `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `max_cost` is 10^18
- `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is `min(costs[0], costs[0] * 2)` if `n` is greater than 1 and `dp[0]` is `costs[0]` if `n` is 1, `dp[1]` is `min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2)` if `n` is greater than 1, `dp[2]` is `min(min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2), 2 * min(costs[1], costs[0] * 2))` if `n` is greater than 1
- `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18)
- `i` is 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

The values of `n`, `L`, `costs`, `max_cost`, and `c` do not directly depend on the loop variable `i`, so they remain the same. However, `dp` might be updated inside the loop body, but since we don't have the loop body, we can't determine the exact values of `dp` at the start of the next iteration. Given the pattern of `dp` initialization, it seems that `dp` is being used to store some dynamic programming state, but without the loop body, we cannot accurately predict its next state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), and `i` is 3**
