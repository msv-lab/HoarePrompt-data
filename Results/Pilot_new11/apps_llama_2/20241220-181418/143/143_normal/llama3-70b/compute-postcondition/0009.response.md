Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is the minimum between `float('inf')` and `float('inf') + costs[0]`, and `vol` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as in the precondition.***
