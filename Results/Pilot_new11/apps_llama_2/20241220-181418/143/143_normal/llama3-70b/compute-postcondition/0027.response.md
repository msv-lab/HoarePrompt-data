To calculate the output state, we must analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2
- `costs` is a list of input integers
- `i` is 2
- `dp[0]` is 0
- `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`
- `dp[2]` is the minimum of its previous value and the minimum of `dp[1] + costs[0]` and `costs[0]`
- `j` is 1
- `vol` is 1

And the code:
```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
```

Let's break down the changes:
- Since `i` is 2 and `vol` is 1, `i - vol` equals 1.
- `dp[i - vol]` (which is `dp[1]`) is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`.
- `costs[j]` where `j` is 1, equals `costs[1]`.
- Therefore, `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]` equals `min(float('inf'), costs[1]) + costs[1]`.
- `dp[i]` (which is `dp[2]`) is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `min(float('inf'), costs[1]) + costs[1]`.

Since `dp[2]` initially is the minimum of its previous value and the minimum of `dp[1] + costs[0]` and `costs[0]`, and now it's updated to be the minimum of its current value and `min(float('inf'), costs[1]) + costs[1]`, we can conclude that `dp[2]` will be the minimum of the minimum of `dp[1] + costs[0]` and `costs[0]`, and `min(float('inf'), costs[1]) + costs[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of the minimum of `dp[1] + costs[0]` and `costs[0]`, and `min(float('inf'), costs[1]) + costs[1]`, `j` is 1, and `vol` is 1**.
