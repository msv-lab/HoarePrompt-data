Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, and `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])` if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, otherwise the state remains unchanged since there is no else part in the code.**
