Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, `j` is 0, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[3]` is the minimum between its previous value (if any) and `dp[3 - vol] + costs[0]`.***
