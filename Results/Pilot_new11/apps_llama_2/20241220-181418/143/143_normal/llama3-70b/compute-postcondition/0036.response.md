The variable `vol` is assigned the value `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 0, `vol` is calculated as `2 ** 0 - 1`, which equals `1 - 1`, resulting in `vol` being 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, `j` is 0, and `vol` is 0**
