Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 30, `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3, and `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`. Since `vol` is greater than `i`, no update is made to `dp` due to the invalid index `i - vol` being out of bounds for the described `dp` list.***
