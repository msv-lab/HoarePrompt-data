To calculate the output state, we must consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2
- `costs` is a list of input integers
- `i` is 2
- `dp[0]` is 0
- `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`
- `dp[2]`'s definition condition is no longer met as `vol` (3) is greater than `i` (2)
- `j` is 2
- `vol` is 3

And the given code:
```python
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
```

Since `i` is 2 and `vol` is 3, `i - vol` equals -1. However, given the context of `dp` and its use, it's likely that array indices are being considered, and accessing `dp[-1]` in Python would refer to the last element of the list. But without explicit definition of `dp`'s size and its elements beyond `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`, and the condition around `dp[2]`, we must infer based on typical dynamic programming (DP) problems, where `dp[i]` often refers to the minimum cost or solution for a subproblem of size `i`.

Given `i = 2` and the operation, we're updating `dp[2]`. However, since `i - vol = 2 - 3 = -1`, and assuming `dp` is a list where negative indices are valid (in Python, counting from the end), this would typically refer to the last element of `dp`. Yet, since we don't have explicit definitions for all elements of `dp` or its size, and considering typical DP problems, it seems we're dealing with an array where indices correspond to specific subproblem sizes.

The issue here is that `dp[i - vol]` when `i = 2` and `vol = 3` results in `dp[-1]`, which doesn't directly correspond to any defined value in the initial state. For DP problems, accessing an index less than 0 (like `-1`) typically isn't what you'd expect in the formula, as it suggests going "before" the base case in many DP constructions. 

However, given the initial conditions and the fact that `dp[2]`'s update condition isn't directly met due to the `vol` being greater than `i`, and considering we might be dealing with a misunderstanding in the application of `vol` and `i` in the context of `dp`, let's assume the intention was to illustrate the update process rather than handle out-of-bounds or invalid index access directly.

Thus, considering the formula and the variables provided, and assuming `dp[-1]` is not the correct interpretation due to the nature of DP arrays and base case definitions, we recognize an issue in directly applying the given values to the formula without considering the context of DP problems and array indexing.

For the given code to apply meaningfully in a DP context with `i = 2` and `vol = 3`, the condition itself (`dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])`) suggests an update rule that depends on previous solutions (`dp[i - vol]`) and additional costs (`costs[j]`). However, since `i - vol` is negative, this does not align with typical DP problem setups where you build solutions from smaller subproblems.

Given the confusion and the specifics of the problem statement, it seems we are to understand the update rule conceptually but apply it with caution. If `dp[2]` is what's being updated, and assuming `dp[-1]` isn't a valid or intended access (since it doesn't fit typical DP array indexing for this kind of problem), the direct application of the formula with given values leads to inconsistencies with typical dynamic programming array access and update logic.

Thus, focusing strictly on the information given and the formula:
- The states of `n`, `L`, `costs`, `j`, and `vol` are not changed by the code.
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated, but given `i = 2`, and considering typical DP structures, `dp[2]` would be the focus, yet the provided `i - vol` results in an invalid or out-of-context access.

Therefore, without additional context on how `dp` is defined beyond the given elements, and considering the provided formula and initial state, the output state concerning the variables directly mentioned would reflect the update intention but must acknowledge the indexing issue:
- `n` remains an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2
- `costs` remains a list of input integers
- `i` remains 2
- `dp[0]` remains 0
- `dp[1]` remains `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`
- The definition or update of `dp[2]` is attempted but poses an issue due to `i - vol` being negative
- `j` remains 2
- `vol` remains 3

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`, an attempt to update `dp[2]` is made but encounters an issue due to indexing, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3**
