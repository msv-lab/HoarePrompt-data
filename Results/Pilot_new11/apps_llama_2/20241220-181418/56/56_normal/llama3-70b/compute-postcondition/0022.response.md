The code `x = n.bit_length() - 1` calculates the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, subtracts 1, and assigns this value to `x`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `n.bit_length()` will be at least 1 (for `n = 1`), and thus `x` will be at least 0. 

The value of `x` is directly dependent on the value of `n`. The `bit_length()` function returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, which is essentially the floor of the logarithm base 2 of `n` plus 1. Therefore, `x = floor(log2(n))`.

The state of `i` is that it is increased by 1, which implies its initial state before the increase is `i - 1`, but since we are given that `i` is increased by 1, its current state remains as "increased by 1" which doesn't specify a particular value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1` or equivalently `floor(log2(n))`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `floor(log2(n))`.**
