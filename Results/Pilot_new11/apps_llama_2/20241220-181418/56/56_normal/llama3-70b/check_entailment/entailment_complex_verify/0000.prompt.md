You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated in the problem description. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when it encounters a negative number or zero. According to the problem description, negative numbers and zero are valid inputs for the sequence (a_1, a_2,..., a_{k}). However, the current program does not handle negative numbers or zero correctly.

Another case is when the input number `n` can be represented as a sum of powers of 2 with multiple sequences of the same length `k`. In such cases, the program should return the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences that have the minimum `y` value. However, the current program does not consider this condition.

For example, if the input is `23 5`, the program should return `3 3 2 1 0` because it is the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences with the minimum `y` value. However, if the input is `7 3`, the program should return `2 1 1` because it is the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences with the minimum `y` value.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to handle negative numbers and zero correctly and to find the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences with the minimum `y` value.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = -1
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            for _ in range(k - len(a)):
                a.append(-1)
        else:
            a = a[:k]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        y = max(a)
        while len(a) > 0 and a[0] == y:
            a.pop(0)
        if len(a) > 0:
            a.append(y)
        if sum([2**x for x in a]) == n and len(a) == k:
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        else:
            print('No')
```
This modified program still does not solve the problem correctly in all cases, because it does not consider all possible sequences of powers of 2. To correctly solve the problem, a more complex algorithm is needed that considers all possible sequences of powers of 2 and finds the lexicographically largest sequence among all sequences with the minimum `y` value. 

However, without further modification, the original program does not work correctly in all cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^18 and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^5.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('No')
    else :
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            
            if x <= i:
                break
            
            a.append(x)
            
            n -= 2 ** x
            
            i += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the remaining value after subtracting the largest powers of 2 that can be represented by the bits in the original value of `n`, `i` is the number of times the most significant bit in `n` can be removed until `x` is less than or equal to `i`, `a` contains the positions of the most significant bits in `n` at each iteration, until the loop breaks.
        if (len(a) < k) :
            print('No')
        else :
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the remaining value after subtracting the largest powers of 2 that can be represented by the bits in the original value of `n`, `i` is the number of times the most significant bit in `n` can be removed until `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `a` contains the positions of the most significant bits in `n` at each iteration, if the length of `a` is less than `k`, the string 'No' has been printed, otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed along with the content of `a` which contains the first `k` positions of the most significant bits in `n` in descending order.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` and `k` are input integers. If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, `n` is the remaining value after subtracting the largest powers of 2 that can be represented by the bits in the original value of `n`, and `i` is the number of times the most significant bit in `n` can be removed until `n` is less than or equal to `i`. Additionally, `a` contains the positions of the most significant bits in `n` at each iteration. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed along with the content of `a`, which contains the first `k` positions of the most significant bits in `n` in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` is less than or equal to 10^18 and `k` is less than or equal to 10^5. It checks if `n` is less than `k` and prints 'No' if true. Otherwise, it calculates the positions of the most significant bits in `n` by iteratively subtracting the largest power of 2 that can be represented by the bits in `n`. The function stores these positions in a list `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it sorts the first `k` elements of `a` in descending order and prints 'Yes' along with the sorted positions. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly to the console. After execution, the state of the program will be one of two possible outcomes: either 'No' will have been printed if `n` is less than `k` or if the number of most significant bits in `n` is less than `k`, or 'Yes' will have been printed along with the first `k` positions of the most significant bits in `n` in descending order if the conditions are met.
