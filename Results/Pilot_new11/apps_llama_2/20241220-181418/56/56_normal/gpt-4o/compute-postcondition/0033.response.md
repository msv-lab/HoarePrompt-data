The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits and `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits. After executing the function body, the function returns a string. 
There are three possible return cases: 
1. The function returns the string 'No'.
2. The function returns the string 'No'.
3. The function returns a string starting with 'Yes\n' followed by the string representations of the elements in a list of length `k` with elements in descending order, separated by spaces.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` of up to 18 digits and a positive integer `k` of up to 5 digits, and return either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a list of `k` numbers in descending order.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, where n is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits and k is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, and returns either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a list of k numbers in descending order.**
