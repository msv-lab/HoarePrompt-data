To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `len(bits) < k`.

1. **Understanding the Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the length of `bits` (the list of indices representing positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`, plus the index `smallest - 1` twice) is less than `k` (a positive integer of up to 5 digits).

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits.
   - `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`.
   - `i` is -1.
   - `bits` is a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus the index `smallest - 1` twice.
   - `smallest` is the last index of a bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` which was the last element in `bits` before it was removed.
   - The number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is less than `k`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `len(bits)` must be less than `k`. Given that the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is already less than `k`, we need to ensure that adding more elements to `bits` (or ensuring its length is such that it's still less than `k`) is possible.
   - Since `bits` includes the index `smallest - 1` twice and represents positions of bits set to 1 in `n`, for the loop to continue, we must ensure that there are enough bits in `n` that can be set to 1 (or are already set to 1 and not yet included in `bits`) to increase the length of `bits` without reaching or exceeding `k`.
   - Given `i` is -1, its value does not directly influence the loop condition but might be relevant in the loop body which is not shown.
   - The condition that the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is less than `k` inherently supports the possibility of the loop continuing since it indicates there's room to add more bits (increase `len(bits)`) without violating the loop condition.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition that `len(bits)` is less than `k`. Since the specifics of how `bits`, `n`, and `k` are modified within the loop are not provided, we focus on the state adjustments needed based on the given information.
   - Given that `n` is of up to 18 digits and `k` is of up to 5 digits, and considering the other conditions, the critical aspect is ensuring that the length of `bits` can increase without reaching `k`, which aligns with the given state that the number of bits set to 1 in `n` plus one is less than `k`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is -1, `bits` is a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus the index `smallest - 1` twice, `smallest` is the last index of a bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` which was the last element in `bits` before it was removed, and the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is less than `k`.**
