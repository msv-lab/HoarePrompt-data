You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the required functionality. Here is an explanation of why it is incorrect:

Consider the case where `n = 23` and `k = 5`. The correct output should be `Yes` followed by `3 3 2 1 0`. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. The issue lies in the way the program generates the `bits` list and then tries to fill it up to size `k`.

In this case, the program first identifies the bits that are set in the binary representation of `n`. This results in the list `[5, 4, 2, 1, 0]` which already has the required size and does not need to be filled. But then it tries to fill it again which would lead to incorrect results for numbers that need to be split into two smaller numbers to get the largest lexicographical order.

A correct implementation would involve finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, and then recursively finding the largest powers of 2 that sum up to the remaining value until `k` numbers are found. If at any point it is impossible to find a combination that meets the criteria, the function should return `No`.

Here is a possible correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    def get_powers(n, k):
        if k == 1:
            if n < 1:
                return []
            return [n]
        for i in range(n.bit_length() - 1, -1, -1):
            power = 1 << i
            if power <= n:
                remaining = n - power
                powers = get_powers(remaining, k - 1)
                if powers:
                    return [i] + powers
        return []
    powers = get_powers(n, k)
    if not powers:
        return 'No'
    powers.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, powers))
```
However, even this corrected version does not guarantee the lexicographically largest sequence in case of ties (when there are multiple sequences with the same maximum value), because it simply sorts the sequence in descending order which may not always result in the lexicographically largest sequence in case of ties.

Therefore, we need to further modify the code to handle ties correctly.

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    def get_powers(n, k):
        if k == 1:
            if n < 1:
                return []
            return [n]
        def bit_length(x):
            return x.bit_length()
        bit_lengths = sorted([i for i in range(60) if (1 << i) <= n], reverse=True)
        result = []
        for bl in bit_lengths:
            power = 1 << bl
            if power <= n and k > 0:
                result.append(bl)
                n -= power
                k -= 1
        if k > 0:
            if n >= k:
                result.extend([-1] * k)
                return result
            else:
                return []
        return result
    powers = get_powers(n, k)
    if not powers or any(p < -1 for p in powers):
        return 'No'
    powers.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, powers))
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits and k is a positive integer of up to 5 digits.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns string 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits and k is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, and k is less than or equal to n
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is -1, and `bits` is a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.
    if (len(bits) > k) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns string 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is -1, `bits` is a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`, and the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, `i` is -1, and `bits` has a length of `k` with its elements determined by the loop's manipulation to meet the length requirement, but not necessarily reflecting the actual bit positions of `n`.
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
    #The program returns a string starting with 'Yes\n' followed by the string representations of the elements in `bits`, a list of length `k` (up to 5 digits) with elements in descending order, separated by spaces.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
