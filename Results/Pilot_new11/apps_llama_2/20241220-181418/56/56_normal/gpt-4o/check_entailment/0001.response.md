Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the required functionality. Here is an explanation of why it is incorrect:

Consider the case where `n = 23` and `k = 5`. The correct output should be `Yes` followed by `3 3 2 1 0`. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. The issue lies in the way the program generates the `bits` list and then tries to fill it up to size `k`.

In this case, the program first identifies the bits that are set in the binary representation of `n`. This results in the list `[5, 4, 2, 1, 0]` which already has the required size and does not need to be filled. But then it tries to fill it again which would lead to incorrect results for numbers that need to be split into two smaller numbers to get the largest lexicographical order.

A correct implementation would involve finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, and then recursively finding the largest powers of 2 that sum up to the remaining value until `k` numbers are found. If at any point it is impossible to find a combination that meets the criteria, the function should return `No`.

Here is a possible correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    def get_powers(n, k):
        if k == 1:
            if n < 1:
                return []
            return [n]
        for i in range(n.bit_length() - 1, -1, -1):
            power = 1 << i
            if power <= n:
                remaining = n - power
                powers = get_powers(remaining, k - 1)
                if powers:
                    return [i] + powers
        return []
    powers = get_powers(n, k)
    if not powers:
        return 'No'
    powers.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, powers))
```
However, even this corrected version does not guarantee the lexicographically largest sequence in case of ties (when there are multiple sequences with the same maximum value), because it simply sorts the sequence in descending order which may not always result in the lexicographically largest sequence in case of ties.

Therefore, we need to further modify the code to handle ties correctly.

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    def get_powers(n, k):
        if k == 1:
            if n < 1:
                return []
            return [n]
        def bit_length(x):
            return x.bit_length()
        bit_lengths = sorted([i for i in range(60) if (1 << i) <= n], reverse=True)
        result = []
        for bl in bit_lengths:
            power = 1 << bl
            if power <= n and k > 0:
                result.append(bl)
                n -= power
                k -= 1
        if k > 0:
            if n >= k:
                result.extend([-1] * k)
                return result
            else:
                return []
        return result
    powers = get_powers(n, k)
    if not powers or any(p < -1 for p in powers):
        return 'No'
    powers.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, powers))
```
