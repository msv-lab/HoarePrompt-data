Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description and correctly determines whether it's possible to find `k` integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals `n` and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible.

Here's why it works:

1. The initial check `if (k > n):` ensures that if `k` is greater than `n`, the program returns 'No', because it's impossible to find `k` integers that satisfy the condition.
2. The program then converts `n` to binary and finds the positions of the bits set to 1, storing them in the `bits` list. This is done to find the largest possible powers of 2 that can sum up to `n`.
3. If the number of bits set to 1 in `n` is greater than `k`, the program returns 'No', because it's impossible to find `k` integers that satisfy the condition.
4. If the number of bits set to 1 is less than `k`, the program enters a loop where it pops the smallest bit position from the `bits` list, reduces it by 1, and appends two copies of the reduced bit position to the list. This process effectively splits the largest power of 2 into two smaller powers of 2, until the length of the `bits` list equals `k`.
5. Finally, the program sorts the `bits` list in descending order using `bits.sort(reverse=True)` and returns a string starting with 'Yes\n' followed by the string representations of the elements in `bits`, separated by spaces.

This approach ensures that the program always finds the lexicographically largest sequence of `k` integers that satisfies the condition, because it starts with the largest possible powers of 2 and splits them into smaller powers of 2 until the length of the sequence equals `k`. If no such sequence exists, the program correctly returns 'No'.
