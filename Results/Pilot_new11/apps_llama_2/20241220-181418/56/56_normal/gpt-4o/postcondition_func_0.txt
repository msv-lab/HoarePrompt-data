The function checks whether it's possible to set exactly `k` bits to 1 in the binary representation of a non-negative integer `n` by potentially shifting bits to the right. It accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits and `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits. The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set to 1 in `n` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, it tries to meet the requirement of having exactly `k` bits set to 1 by shifting the rightmost set bit to the right and duplicating it until `k` bits are set. If this process is successful, the function returns 'Yes' followed by a list of `k` numbers representing the bit positions in descending order. Note that the bit positions in the returned list may not reflect the actual bit positions in the original number `n` due to the manipulation performed by the function. The function handles potential edge cases, including when `n` is 0, when `k` is 1, and when `n` has fewer than `k` bits set to 1. However, it does not handle cases where the input values exceed the specified digit limits or where the inputs are not integers.
