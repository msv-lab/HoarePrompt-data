Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. It simply calculates the minimum between `k` and `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, which is incorrect. 

The problem asks to release `k` fishes in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. However, the given program does not consider the placement of fishes to maximize the expected value. 

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: 

Suppose `n = 12`, `m = 17`, `r = 9`, and `k = 40`. In this case, the program will calculate `ans` as `min(40, (12 - 9 + 1) * (17 - 9 + 1)) = min(40, 4 * 9) = min(40, 36) = 36`. However, the expected output for this case is `32.8333333333`, which implies a different placement of fishes to maximize the expected value.

The correct approach to solve this problem would be to distribute the fishes in a way that each fish is caught with the maximum probability. This can be achieved by putting the fishes in cells such that the square of size `r x r` can cover the maximum number of fishes. 

However, the given program does not implement this strategy and simply calculates the minimum between `k` and the number of possible positions of the scoop-net. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
