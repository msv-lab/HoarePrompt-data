You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given code is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the coverage of each cell in the pond and then selecting the cells with the highest coverage to place the fishes. However, there are a few issues with the code that make it incorrect.

1. The `coverage` function is not correctly calculating the coverage of each cell. It seems to be calculating the number of cells that are within the scoop-net when it is placed at the current cell, but this is not the correct definition of coverage.

2. The `func_1` function is using a heap to select the cells with the highest coverage, but it is not correctly updating the coverage of the cells after each placement. When a cell is placed, the coverage of its neighboring cells should be updated to reflect that they now have one less possible position where the scoop-net can be placed.

3. The code does not handle the case where there are multiple cells with the same highest coverage. In this case, the code should place the fish in the cell that has the highest number of neighboring cells that are also within the scoop-net.

A correct solution to this problem would involve a more complex algorithm that takes into account the interactions between the different cells and the scoop-net. The algorithm would need to consider the probability of the scoop-net being placed at each possible position and the expected number of fishes caught for each position.

A correct code would involve calculating the expected number of caught fishes for each placement of the fish and then selecting the placement that results in the highest expected number of caught fishes. The expected number of caught fishes can be calculated by summing over all possible positions of the scoop-net and multiplying the probability of the scoop-net being placed at each position by the number of fishes caught at that position.

One possible approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm that at each step places the fish in the cell that results in the highest expected number of caught fishes. This can be done by iterating over all possible positions and calculating the expected number of caught fishes for each position.

However, the provided code does not implement this algorithm correctly and therefore is incorrect. 

An example where the program does not work correctly is when the input is `3 3 2 1`. The program should place the fish in the cell that has the highest coverage, which in this case is the middle cell. However, the program does not correctly calculate the coverage of the cells and therefore does not place the fish in the correct cell. 

In this example, the coverage of the cell (1, 1) should be 4, because if we place the fish in this cell, there are 4 possible positions for the scoop-net where the fish will be caught. However, the `coverage` function in the program does not correctly calculate this coverage. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this example and is therefore incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `coverage(x, y)` calculates and returns the product of two window sizes, one related to position `x` within bounds `n` and `r`, and the other related to position `y` within bounds `m` and `r`. The window sizes are calculated as `(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0))` and `(min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))`, where `x`, `y` are non-negative integers less than `n` and `m` respectively, and `r` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`. The function handles edge cases where `x - r + 1 + 1` is less than 0, in which case the window size is calculated from 0. It also handles cases where `x + 1` or `y + 1` exceeds `n - r + 1` or `m - r + 1` respectively, by limiting the window size to `n - r + 1` or `m - r + 1`. The function returns a non-negative integer value, which is the product of the two calculated window sizes. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has calculated and returned this product, leaving the input variables `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r` unchanged.+
