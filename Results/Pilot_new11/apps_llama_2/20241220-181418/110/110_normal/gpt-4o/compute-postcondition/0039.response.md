The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a rectangular pond. `r` is a positive integer representing the size of a square scoop, which is less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`. `k` is a positive integer representing the number of fishes, which is less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5. 

After executing the function body, the function returns the average coverage per position. This average is calculated as the sum of the `k` highest coverage values divided by the total number of positions in the rectangular pond, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the dimensions of a rectangular pond, the size of a square scoop, and the number of fishes, and return the average coverage per position based on the `k` highest coverage values in the pond.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, representing the dimensions of a rectangular pond, the size of a square scoop, and the number of fishes, and returns the average coverage per position based on the k highest coverage values in the pond.**
