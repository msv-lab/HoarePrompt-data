To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given expression with the provided initial state. 

The initial state gives us information about the variables:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
- `0 <= x < n` and `0 <= y < m`.
- `n`, `m`, and `r` are non-negative integers where `1 <= n, m <= 10^5` and `1 <= r <= min(n, m)`.

The expression to evaluate is:
```python
return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
```

Let's break down the components of the expression:
1. `min(x + 1, n - r + 1)`: This returns the minimum value between `x + 1` and `n - r + 1`. Given `x < n` and `r <= min(n, m)`, this value will be at least 1 (since `x` and `r` are non-negative integers and `n > 0`) and at most `n - r + 1`.
2. `max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)`: This returns the maximum value between `x - r + 2` and `0`. Given `x` and `r` are non-negative and `r <= n`, if `x - r + 2` is negative, it means `x < r - 2`, but since `x >= 0`, this component will be `0` when `x < r - 1`.
3. Similarly, `min(y + 1, m - r + 1)` and `max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0)` can be analyzed with the same logic, replacing `x` with `y` and `n` with `m`.

Considering the constraints and the nature of `min` and `max` functions:
- The first part of the expression `(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0))` calculates a value that represents a "window" of possible positions or counts related to `x` and `r` within the constraint of `n`. This value will be non-negative because it's the difference between two quantities where the first is at least as large as the second due to the constraints on `x`, `n`, and `r`.
- The same logic applies to the second part of the expression related to `y`, `m`, and `r`.

Since both parts of the expression before and after the multiplication are non-negative (due to the use of `min` and `max` functions and the given constraints), and given that `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r` are all integers, the result of the expression will be a non-negative integer.

The returned value is a product of two quantities, each of which is derived from the constraints and relationships between `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r`. The exact value depends on the specific values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `r` within their defined ranges.

Output State: **The program returns a non-negative integer value that is the product of two calculated "window" sizes related to x, y, n, m, and r, where x and y are non-negative integers less than n and m respectively, and r is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the minimum of n and m.**
