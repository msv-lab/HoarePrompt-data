The given code pushes a new tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` into the `heap` list, where `x` is 2 and `y` is 1. The `coverage` function is not defined in the initial state, so we will assume its value is calculated based on `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of `m+2` tuples, with `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, a tuple `(-coverage(2, 0), 2, 0)`, and an additional tuple `(-coverage(2, 1), 2, 1)`, `x` is 2, `y` is 1**
