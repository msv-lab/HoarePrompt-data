The code sorts the list `files` based on the integer value in each tuple in descending order. The sorting is done in-place, meaning it modifies the original list.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not affected by the sorting operation. The list `files` now contains the same tuples, but they are ordered based on the integer values in descending order. The strings in the tuples are still distinct, consist of digits and small English letters, and have a length from 1 to 6 characters.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a string and an integer, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, all strings are distinct, and the tuples are sorted in descending order based on the integer value.**
