The code appends a tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the list `files`. The value of `name` is a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, and the value of `type_` is an integer (0 or 1). 

The length of `files` increases by 1. The other variables are not affected. 

The output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `name` is a string consisting of digits and small English letters with a length from 1 to 6 characters, `type_` is an integer (0 or 1), the input consists of `n-3` lines that have been processed and at least one line is still pending, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct, `files` is a list containing at least three tuples, including the newly added tuple `(name, int(type_))`.
