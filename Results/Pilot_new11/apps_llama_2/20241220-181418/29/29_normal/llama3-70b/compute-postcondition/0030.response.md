To determine the output state, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

The initial state provides information about several variables:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters, and an integer. These tuples are sorted in descending order by the integer value.
- `examples` is a list of strings.
- `regular` is a list of strings.
- `script` contains strings in a specific format, depending on the contents of `examples` and `regular`.

The code snippet simply prints the length of `script`.

Given this, the output of the code will be the number of strings in `script`. The number of strings in `script` is determined by the number of strings in `examples` and `regular`, as `script` is generated based on these lists.

The generation of `script` implies that for each string in `examples`, a corresponding string is added to `script`, and similarly, for each string in `regular`, another string is added, but with a different range for `i`. However, the exact lengths of `examples` and `regular` are not provided, which means we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for the length of `script` without more specific information about these lists.

Since we're asked to provide the output state, including any values or expressions that variables are equal to, and given the constraints provided:

- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `files` remains a list of `n` tuples, as described.
- `examples` and `regular` remain lists of strings, with their lengths influencing the length of `script`.
- The length of `script` is printed, but this action does not change the state of the variables; it merely reports a value.

Therefore, considering all the information and the fact that the print statement does not alter the state of the variables but merely outputs a value, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, and the length of `script` has been printed, which equals the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`.**
