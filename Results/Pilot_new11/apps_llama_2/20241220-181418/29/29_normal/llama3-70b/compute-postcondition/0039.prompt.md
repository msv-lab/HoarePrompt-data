You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the input consists of a single integer n, followed by n lines, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name, type_ = input().split()
        
        files.append((name, int(type_)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a string and an integer, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct.
    files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples`, or an empty list if `examples` is empty.
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, and `script` contains strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples`, and for each `file` in `regular` with `i` ranging from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular)` if `regular` is not empty, or remains as in the initial state if `regular` is empty.
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list of strings that has been fully printed, and if `script` is not empty, `line` is the last line in `script`, otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of inputs consisting of n lines, each with a unique string and a binary integer, and produces an unspecified output.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
