Since the function `func()` does not explicitly define any parameters, we can infer that the input is provided through other means, likely through a predefined input stream or global variables.


Given the constraints, the input consists of:
1. An integer `n`, representing the number of subsequent lines.
2. `n` lines, each containing a string and an integer (0 or 1).
   - The string consists of digits and small English letters, with a length from 1 to 6 characters.
   - All strings are distinct.


However, the problem statement does not explicitly describe the output of the function. Therefore, I will provide a general description based on the input constraints.


The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of inputs as described. After executing the function body, the return value is not specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a set of inputs consisting of `n` lines, where each line contains a unique string and a binary integer, and to produce an unspecified output based on this input.


Functionality: **The function processes a series of inputs consisting of n lines, each with a unique string and a binary integer, and produces an unspecified output.**
