The value of `script` is updated by appending a new string in the format `f'move {file} {i}'`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings that must have at least one more element, `script` is a list containing all the previous strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples` and an additional string `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first element in `regular` and `i` is at least `len(examples) + 1`, or an empty list if `examples` is empty and only contains `f'move {file} {i}'` where `file` is the first element in `regular` and `i` is at least 1, and `i` is the index of the next element in `regular` which is at least `len(examples) + 1` and `file` is the next element in `regular`, and also contains the newly appended string `f'move {file} {i}'`**
