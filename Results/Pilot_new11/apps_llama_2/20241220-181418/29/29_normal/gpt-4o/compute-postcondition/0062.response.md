The value of `examples[i]` is updated to the string representation of `temp_counter`. Since `i` equals 2, this means `examples[2]` is assigned the value `str(temp_counter)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3 where `examples[2]` equals `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or its string representation is not in `files_set`, `moves` contains the updated values based on the initial conditions, the final value of `temp_counter`, and the additional move 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}'**
