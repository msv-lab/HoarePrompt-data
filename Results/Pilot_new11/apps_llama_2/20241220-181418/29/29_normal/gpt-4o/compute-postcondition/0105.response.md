The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`. The other variables are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and `i` is as updated with `regulars`, `temp_counter - 1`, and `moves` accordingly.**
