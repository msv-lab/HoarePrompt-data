The value of `examples[i]` is updated to be the string representation of `temp_counter`. Since `i` equals 1, `examples[1]` is updated to be the string representation of `temp_counter`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` remains the original value, `files`, `examples[0]` and `regulars` are unchanged, `i` equals 1, `moves` contains its initial value based on `examples[0]` and 'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}', `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than its initial value (`n + 1` or `n + 2`) that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`, `examples[1]` is the string representation of `temp_counter`.**
