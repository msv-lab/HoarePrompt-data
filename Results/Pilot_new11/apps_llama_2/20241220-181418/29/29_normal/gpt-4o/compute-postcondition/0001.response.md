The code initializes an empty list `regulars`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `files`, or `examples`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a string of digits and small English letters (the filename) and an integer (the type, either 0 or 1) such that the filenames are distinct and the length of each filename is from 1 to 6 characters, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list**
