Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 files, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the third `file`, `type_` is the second part of the third `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` at least three times and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing `name` at least three times.**
