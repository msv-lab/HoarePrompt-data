To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, for this condition to be true, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `n` has a defined range, `temp_counter` just needs to be within this range for the condition to potentially be true. However, since we're looking at the state right before the loop and wanting to ensure it can execute at least once, we need to ensure `temp_counter` is indeed less than or equal to `2 * n`. Given `n`'s definition, this part of the condition can be satisfied by ensuring `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - This condition requires that the string representation of `temp_counter` is present in `files_set`. For the loop to execute, this condition must be true. Given that `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, and assuming `files_set` is derived from `files` ( likely containing filenames), the state needs to ensure that `temp_counter`'s string representation matches a filename in `files_set`.

Considering these conditions, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`, meaning there must be a filename in `files` that matches the string representation of `temp_counter`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type.
- `examples` and `target` are defined based on `files` and `i`, but their specific values do not directly affect the loop condition.
- `i` is incremented, and `regulars`, `temp_counter`, and `moves` are updated accordingly.

To adjust the state so the loop can certainly execute one more time:
- Ensure `temp_counter` is within the range that allows it to be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Ensure that `files_set` contains the string representation of `temp_counter`, which means there must be a filename in `files` that matches `str(temp_counter)`.

Thus, the adjusted state, considering the need for the loop to execute and the provided conditions, would be:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `i` is as updated with `regulars`, `temp_counter`, and `moves` accordingly.**
