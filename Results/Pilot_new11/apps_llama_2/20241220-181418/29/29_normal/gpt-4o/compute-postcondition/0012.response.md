Given the initial state and the code snippet `regulars.append(name)`, let's analyze the impact of this code.

The code appends the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. Initially, if `type_` is equal to '1', then `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `regulars` is a list containing the first part of the second file in `files`, which is `name`. 

After executing the code, the value of `name` is added to the `regulars` list. So, if `type_` is equal to '1', `regulars` will now contain `[name]`. If `type_` is not equal to '1', `regulars` will now contain `[name, name]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` remains a list of tuples with at least 2 files, `file` remains the second file in the `files` list, `name` remains the first part of the second `file`, and `type_` remains the second part of the second `file`. 

If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` remains a list containing the first part of the second file in `files`, which is `[name]`. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` remains an empty list.

The updated state of `regulars` depends on the value of `type_`. If `type_` is '1', `regulars` will be `[name]`. If `type_` is not '1', `regulars` will be `[name, name]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 files, `file` is the second file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the second `file`, `type_` is the second part of the second `file`, if `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` and `regulars` is a list containing `name`; if `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing two `name`s**
