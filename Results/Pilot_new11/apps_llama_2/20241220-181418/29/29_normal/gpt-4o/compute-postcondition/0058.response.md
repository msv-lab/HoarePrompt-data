To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the conditions of the `while` loop. The loop will execute as long as two conditions are met:

1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3.
- `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1'.
- `i` equals 2.
- If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` contains its updated value based on `examples[0]` and 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}' and also contains 'move {examples[2]} {3}'.
- `temp_counter`'s new value is `temp_counter + 1` and is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- The string representation of `temp_counter`'s new value must be in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions (`temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`) are still met after the previous iteration.

1. **Condition 1 (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`):** Since `temp_counter`'s new value is `temp_counter + 1` and it is given that this new value is less than or equal to `2 * n`, we do not need to adjust `n` or `temp_counter` to meet this condition, assuming the increment does not violate this constraint. However, we should note that `temp_counter` must remain less than or equal to `2 * n` after the increment, which is already satisfied according to the given state.

2. **Condition 2 (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`):** The string representation of `temp_counter`'s new value must be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that the string representation of this new `temp_counter` value is also in `files_set`. This means the state of `files_set` needs to be such that it includes the string representation of `temp_counter + 1`.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `temp_counter + 1` is within the bounds of `2 * n` (which is already given to be true) and that the string representation of `temp_counter + 1` is in `files_set`. No adjustments are needed for `n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, or `i`, as their values do not directly impact the loop's condition for the next iteration. The critical adjustments are about ensuring the conditions for `temp_counter` and its relationship with `files_set` are met.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, `temp_counter`'s value is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and the string representation of `temp_counter`'s new value must be in `files_set`**
