To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop statement. The loop will execute as long as two conditions are met:

1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be in `files_set` (which is presumably derived from the list `files`, although the exact derivation is not specified).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `files` is a list of tuples containing filenames and types, including a filename that is the string representation of `temp_counter`.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 2.
- `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1'.
- `temp_counter` is either `n + 2` or `n + 3`.
- `i` equals 1.
- `moves` contains a specific move command based on `examples[0]` and `temp_counter`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n` and that the string representation of the next `temp_counter` value is in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` is either `n + 2` or `n + 3`, for it to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 if `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, or greater than or equal to 3 if `temp_counter` is `n + 3`. However, the condition that `n` is between 1 and 10^5 already accommodates these requirements, so no adjustment to `n` itself is necessary based on this condition alone.

The critical adjustment needed for the loop to execute again involves ensuring that the next value of `temp_counter` is within the bounds of the loop condition and that its string representation is in `files_set`. Given `temp_counter` is either `n + 2` or `n + 3`, and without specific details on how `files_set` is updated or managed, the essential requirement is that `files` (and by extension, `files_set`) includes a tuple with a filename that matches the string representation of the next `temp_counter` value.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, considering the constraints:

- The relationship between `n` and `temp_counter` must allow `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Given `temp_counter`'s possible values (`n + 2` or `n + 3`), and considering `n`'s range, this condition can be satisfied without further constraints on `n`.
- The string representation of the next `temp_counter` must be included in `files_set`. This implies that `files` must include a tuple where the filename matches the next expected value of `temp_counter`.

Other states (`i`, `moves`, `examples`, `regulars`) do not directly influence the loop's ability to execute again based on the provided `while` loop condition.

Thus, the state adjustment focuses on ensuring that the next `temp_counter` value's string representation is in `files_set`, without needing to explicitly adjust `n`, `i`, `moves`, `examples`, or `regulars` based on the information provided.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a filename that is the string representation of `temp_counter` and the next expected value of `temp_counter`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 2, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is either `n + 2` or `n + 3`, `i` equals 1, and `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty**
