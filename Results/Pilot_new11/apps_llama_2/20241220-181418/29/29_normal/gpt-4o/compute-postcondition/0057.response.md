The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was less than or equal to `2 * n`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is also less than or equal to `2 * n` since `temp_counter` was incremented by 1. The string representation of `temp_counter`'s new value must still be in `files_set`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` contains its updated value based on `examples[0]` and 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}' and also contains 'move {examples[2]} {3}', `temp_counter`'s new value is `temp_counter + 1` and is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the string representation of `temp_counter`'s new value must be in `files_set`**
