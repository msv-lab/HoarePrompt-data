Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where if the first element is not equal to '1', it is updated to `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is either `n + 1` if `examples[0]` equals '1' or `n + 2` if `examples[0]` does not equal '1', `i` equals 0, and `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty.**
