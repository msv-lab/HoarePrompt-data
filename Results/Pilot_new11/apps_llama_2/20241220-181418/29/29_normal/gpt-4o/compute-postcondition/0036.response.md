To determine the output state, let's consider the impact of the code on the program.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
   - `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type.
   - `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1'.
   - `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1'.
   - `temp_counter` is `n + 2`.
   - `i` equals 0.
   - The current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, thus `examples` at index `i` will be updated to `str(temp_counter - 1)`.
   - `moves` contains the string `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'`.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The code `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}')` appends a new string to the `moves` list. This string is in the format `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`.
   - Since `i` equals 0, `examples[i]` refers to the first element of `examples`, and `i + 1` equals 1.
   - Therefore, the new string appended to `moves` is `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`.

3. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
   - `files` remains unchanged.
   - `examples` remains unchanged because the update mentioned in the initial state (where `examples` at index `i` is updated to `str(temp_counter - 1)`) does not occur in the provided code snippet; it was a condition given in the initial state.
   - `regulars` remains unchanged.
   - `temp_counter` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
   - `i` remains 0, as its value is not changed by the code.
   - `moves` now contains two strings: the original string `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` and the newly appended string `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`.

Given the information and focusing on the specifics of the changes, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where the first element is not equal to '1' and is actually `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `i` equals 0, and `moves` contains two strings: `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`.**
