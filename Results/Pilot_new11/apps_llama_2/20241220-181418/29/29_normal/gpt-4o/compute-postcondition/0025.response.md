The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, so the new value of `temp_counter` is `n + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `i` is 0, the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, and `str(n + 2)` must be in `files_set`**
