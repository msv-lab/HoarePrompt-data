Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, the current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the current value of `str(target)`, if this condition was not met previously, then `moves` includes an additional move operation 'move {previous value of `regulars[i]`} {previous value of `target`}', otherwise no changes were made to `moves` previously, and now `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, the current value of `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` is updated with a new element 'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'**
