To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must consider the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1:** `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` equals its old value plus 1. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must still be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` has just been incremented, we need to ensure that its new value does not exceed `2 * n`. Given that `temp_counter`'s previous value did not exceed `2 * n` and there is a value between `temp_counter`'s previous value and `2 * n` (inclusive) whose string representation is in `files_set` and that is `temp_counter`, we need to verify that the incremented `temp_counter` still meets the condition. Therefore, the condition related to `n` remains unchanged as it depends on the value of `temp_counter`, which has been adjusted.

2. **Condition 2:** `str(temp_counter) in files_set`
   - For the loop to execute again, the string representation of the new `temp_counter` value must be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` has been incremented, we need to ensure that its new string representation is indeed in `files_set`. The fact that there is a value between `temp_counter`'s previous value and `2 * n` (inclusive) whose string representation is in `files_set` and that is `temp_counter` (now the old value of `temp_counter`), does not guarantee this condition for the new `temp_counter` value. Thus, we must adjust the state to reflect that the new `temp_counter`'s string representation must also be in `files_set`.

Given these considerations, the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time are related to ensuring that `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n` and that its string representation is in `files_set` after the increment.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` contains its updated value based on `examples[0]` and 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}' and also contains 'move {examples[2]} {3}', `temp_counter`'s new value must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, the string representation of `temp_counter`'s new value must be in `files_set`, and other conditions as previously described**
