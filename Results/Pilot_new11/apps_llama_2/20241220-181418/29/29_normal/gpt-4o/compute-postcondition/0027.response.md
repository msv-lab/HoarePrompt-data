The code increments the `temp_counter` by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, so after the increment operation, `temp_counter` becomes `n + 3`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, `i` is 0, the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, `str(n + 2)` and `str(n + 3)` must be in `files_set`**
