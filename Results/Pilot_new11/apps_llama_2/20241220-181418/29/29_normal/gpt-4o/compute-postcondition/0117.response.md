Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` equals `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` includes an additional move operation 'move {previous value of `regulars[i]`} {current value of `target`}'. If `regulars[i]` is equal to `str(target)`, then the state remains unchanged.**
