To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop.

The loop will execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. The string representation of `temp_counter` must be present in `files_set`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `files` is a list of tuples where at least one tuple contains a filename '1'.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1'.
- `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' with at least 2 filenames.
- `i` is 1.
- `target` is `len(examples) + 2`.
- `temp_counter` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions of the `while` loop are still met after the previous iteration.

1. **Condition 1 (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`):** 
   - Since `temp_counter` is 2 and `n` is between 1 and 10^5, we can see that `2 * n` will always be greater than 2 because `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `temp_counter` (which is 2) is always less than or equal to `2 * n` given the current constraints on `n`. No adjustment is needed here for this specific condition because it's already satisfied by the given state.

2. **Condition 2 (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`):** 
   - Since `temp_counter` is 2, the string representation of `temp_counter` is '2'. For the loop to execute again, '2' must be in `files_set`.
   - Given that `files` is a list of tuples where at least one tuple contains a filename '1', there is no explicit information about '2' being in `files` or `files_set`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure '2' is included in `files_set` for the loop to potentially execute again.

Given these considerations, the adjustments needed for the loop to potentially execute one more time are related to ensuring that `str(temp_counter)` (which is '2' when `temp_counter` is 2, but considering it needs to increment for the next iteration, it should be '3' for the next iteration) is in `files_set`, and that `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n`.

Therefore, the state adjustments should include:
- Ensuring `files_set` contains the next `temp_counter` value (which would be '3' for the next iteration).

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where at least one tuple contains a filename '1' and '2' and potentially '3', `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' with at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `temp_counter` is 2, and '3' is in `files_set`**
