The code `examples.append(name)` appends the `name` to the `examples` list. 

If the second part of the third `file` is equal to '1', then `examples` initially contains the `name` at least twice and `regulars` is an empty list. After executing the code, `examples` will contain the `name` at least three times and `regulars` is still an empty list.

If the second part of the third `file` is not equal to '1', then `examples` initially is an empty list and `regulars` contains the `name` at least twice. After executing the code, `examples` will contain the `name` at least once and `regulars` is still a list containing the `name` at least twice.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 files, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the third `file`, `type_` is the second part of the third `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` at least three times and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` at least once and `regulars` is a list containing `name` at least twice.**
