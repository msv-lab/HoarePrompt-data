You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. It reads the input, identifies the files containing examples and regular tests, and generates the necessary moves to rename the files as specified.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input from the standard input, splits it into lines, and extracts the number of files (`n`) and the file information.
2.  **File Classification:** The program accurately classifies the files into examples and regular tests based on the type (`1` or `0`) provided in the input.
3.  **Move Generation:** The program generates the necessary moves to rename the files. It first checks if an example file needs to be moved to its correct position. If so, it checks if the target position is already occupied. If occupied, it uses a temporary counter to find an available position, moves the file to that position, and then moves it to the correct position. A similar approach is used for regular test files.
4.  **Move Counting and Output:** The program correctly counts the number of moves and prints the moves in the required format.

To verify the program's correctness, let's consider various scenarios:

*   **Empty Input:** Although the program does not explicitly handle empty input, it will still work correctly because it uses the `n` variable to control the loop that processes the files.
*   **Single File:** The program handles the case with a single file correctly, as it will either move the file to its correct position or not move it at all if it's already in the correct position.
*   **Multiple Files:** The program correctly handles cases with multiple files, including scenarios where files need to be moved to their correct positions, and temporary positions are used to avoid conflicts.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the program is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of files `files`, where each file is a tuple containing a filename and a type. It then separates the files into `examples` (type '1') and `regulars` (not type '1'). The function renames `examples` and `regulars` to match expected numeric filenames (e.g., '1', '2', etc.) and generates a list of move commands (`moves`) for the updated filenames. The function returns the list of move commands. However, there are several issues with the provided code that affect its functionality: (1) the line `name, type_ = file.split()` will raise an error because `files` is a list of tuples, not strings; (2) the variable `files_set` is used but never defined; (3) the function does not handle potential errors, such as when `n` is outside the specified range or when `files` contains invalid data. Despite these issues, the function's purpose is to generate move commands to rename files to match expected numeric filenames, considering the file type and the number of files.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
