The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of an integer input to the variable `x`. The initial state of the camera angle in degrees is still between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive). The code does not modify the camera angle, so its state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **the camera angle in degrees is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), where positive values denote clockwise camera rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation, and `x` is an input integer**.
