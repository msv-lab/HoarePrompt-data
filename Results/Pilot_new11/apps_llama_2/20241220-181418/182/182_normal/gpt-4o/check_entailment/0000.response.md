Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all possible cases as described in the problem. 

For example, if the input is -60, the program calculates the normalized angle as -60 % 360 = 300, and then it calculates the turns as (360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 60 // 90 % 4 = 0. However, the correct answer is 3.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical. It simply calculates the number of turns required to rotate the image to the original position, which is not the same as minimizing the deviation.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the four possible cases: 

- rotating the image 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees clockwise, 

and calculate the deviation from the vertical for each case. The correct answer will be the number of turns that minimizes this deviation.

A correct implementation would consider these cases and calculate the deviation for each one, returning the number of turns that results in the smallest deviation.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360

    deviations = []
    for turns in range(4):
        total_angle = (normalized_angle + turns * 90) % 360
        deviation = min(total_angle, 360 - total_angle)
        deviations.append((deviation, turns))

    min_deviation_turns = min(deviations, key=lambda x: x[0])[1]
    print(min_deviation_turns)
```
