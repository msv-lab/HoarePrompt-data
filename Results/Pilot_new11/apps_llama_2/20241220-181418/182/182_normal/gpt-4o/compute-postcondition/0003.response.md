The code snippet provided is a print statement that outputs the value of `turns`. This operation does not modify the values of `x`, `normalized_angle`, or `turns`. It simply prints the current value of `turns` to the console. Since the print statement does not alter the state of the variables, their ranges and relationships remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, `normalized_angle` is an integer in the range -359 ≤ `normalized_angle` ≤ 360 where `normalized_angle` = `x` % 360, `turns` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ `turns` ≤ 3, and the value of `turns` has been printed.**
