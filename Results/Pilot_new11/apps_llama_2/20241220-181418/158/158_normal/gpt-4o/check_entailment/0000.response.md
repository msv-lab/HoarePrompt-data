Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It takes the input for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) Nikolay has.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`) by finding the minimum of `a`, `b // 2` (since there should be 2 apples for every lemon), and `c // 4` (since there should be 4 pears for every lemon). The `//` operator performs integer division, ensuring that we get the largest whole number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available fruits.
3. It calculates the total number of fruits that can be used by multiplying `max_lemons` by the ratio (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears) and prints this value.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem statement, including:

- Ensuring that the fruits are used in the ratio 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears).
- Not allowing the fruits to be cut or broken into pieces, as the program only considers whole numbers of fruits.

The examples provided in the problem description also match the expected output of the program, which further supports its correctness. Without being able to find a specific case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
