Correctness: **True**.

I believe the program is correct because it accurately determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. The program calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the available lemons, apples, and pears, considering the required ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It takes the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input and calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used with the available fruits, considering the ratio. 
   - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the number of lemons does not exceed the number of available lemons, apples, or pears when multiplied by their respective ratios.

2. Then, it prints the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote by multiplying the minimum number of lemons by the ratios and summing them up. 
   - `print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)` calculates the total number of fruits that can be used.

The program handles all possible cases, including when no fruits can be used due to insufficient quantities. For example, if the input is 2, 3, and 2, the output will correctly be 0 because there are not enough pears to cook a compote with the required ratio. 

Overall, the program's logic aligns with the problem description, and I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
