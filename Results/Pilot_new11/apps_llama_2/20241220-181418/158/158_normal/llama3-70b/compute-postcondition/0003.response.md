To find the output state, we first need to understand what the given code does. The code calculates the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`, and assigns this minimum value to the variable `min_lemon`.

Given the initial state: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.

We calculate `min_lemon` as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number. So, `b // 2` will be the integer part of half of `b`, and `c // 4` will be the integer part of a quarter of `c`.

Therefore, `min_lemon` will be the smallest among these three values: `a`, the integer part of `b / 2`, and the integer part of `c / 4`.

The states of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation; only a new variable `min_lemon` is introduced with the calculated minimum value.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
