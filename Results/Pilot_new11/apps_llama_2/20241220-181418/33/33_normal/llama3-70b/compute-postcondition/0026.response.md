According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If the loop has executed at least once, the value of `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. However, since we're using a for loop with a range, we're actually concerned with the iteration counter being less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, it must not have reached the end of the range `n`. Since the loop counter is implicit in Python's for loop, we can think of it as incrementing by 1 after each iteration.

Given that the loop body is omitted, we focus on the condition for the loop to continue, which is that the loop counter (implicitly `_` in this case) must be less than `n`. After one iteration, this implicit counter would be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string**
