Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, the program has terminated after printing 'NO'. Otherwise, the execution continues with the updated or unchanged variables, depending on the direction and latitude updates that may occur in subsequent iterations, ensuring that `curr_lat` remains within the valid range if the program hasn't terminated.**
