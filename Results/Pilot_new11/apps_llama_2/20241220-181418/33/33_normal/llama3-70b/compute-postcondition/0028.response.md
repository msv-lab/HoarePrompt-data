The code converts the string `t` to an integer using the `int()` function. The value of `t` was a string representing an integer, so after the conversion, `t` will be an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction**
