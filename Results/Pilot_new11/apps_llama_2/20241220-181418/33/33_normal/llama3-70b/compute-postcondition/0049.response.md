Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is not 'South', then the program moves on to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `curr_lat`.***
