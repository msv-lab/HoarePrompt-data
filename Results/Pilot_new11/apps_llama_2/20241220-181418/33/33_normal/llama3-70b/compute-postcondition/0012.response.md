Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string, and the input direction `dir` is not 'North'. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is `90 - t / 111.195`. Otherwise, `curr_lat` remains 90 and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop, with `dir` not being 'South'.***
