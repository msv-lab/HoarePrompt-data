The `exit()` function terminates the program entirely, so no further changes are made to any variables after this point. The program ends, and no more execution occurs.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction, the string 'NO' has been printed to the console, and the program has terminated. If `dir` was 'North', then `curr_lat` was increased by `t / 111.195` before termination. If `dir` was 'South', then `curr_lat` was decreased by `t / 111.195` before termination. If `dir` was neither 'North' nor 'South', then `curr_lat` remains unchanged. The program has ended, and no further changes will occur.**
