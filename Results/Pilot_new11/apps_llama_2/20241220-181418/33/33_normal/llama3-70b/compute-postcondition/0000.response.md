The value of `n` is updated to be the integer input by the user. The previous constraints on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) are no longer applicable, as `n` can now take any integer value based on the user's input. The values and constraints of `t_{i}` and `dir_{i}` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, for each i-th part of the journey, `t_{i}` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t_{i}` ≤ 10^6), and `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East"**
