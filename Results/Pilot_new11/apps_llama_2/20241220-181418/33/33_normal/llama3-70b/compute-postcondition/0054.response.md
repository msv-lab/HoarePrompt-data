The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console, indicating that the program has terminated due to `curr_lat` being outside the range [-90, 90]. The values of `n`, `t_{i}`, `dir_{i}`, `t`, and `dir` are not affected by this code. 

Before termination, if `dir` was 'North', `curr_lat` was increased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` was 'South', `curr_lat` was decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` was neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction, the program has printed 'NO' to the console and terminated, if `dir` was 'North' before termination, `curr_lat` was increased by `t / 111.195` before termination, if `dir` was 'South' before termination, `curr_lat` was decreased by `t / 111.195` before termination, if `dir` was neither 'North' nor 'South' before termination, `curr_lat` remains unchanged**
