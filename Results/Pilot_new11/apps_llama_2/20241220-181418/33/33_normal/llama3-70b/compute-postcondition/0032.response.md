Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to its original value - `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is not 'South', the program skips to the next iteration of the loop, leaving the variables unchanged.***
