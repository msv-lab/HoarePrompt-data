The code takes an input in the format of two values separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `t` and `dir` respectively. Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `curr_lat` is 90.

After the code is executed, `t` is assigned the value of the first part of the input (which is expected to be an integer given the context of `t_{i}` being a positive integer), and `dir` is assigned the value of the second part of the input (which is expected to be one of the direction strings given the context of `dir_{i}`).

The states of `n`, `t_{i}`, `dir_{i}`, and `curr_lat` are not directly affected by this code, except that `t` and `dir` now hold new values from the input. Thus, `t` becomes an input integer and `dir` becomes an input direction string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input direction string**
