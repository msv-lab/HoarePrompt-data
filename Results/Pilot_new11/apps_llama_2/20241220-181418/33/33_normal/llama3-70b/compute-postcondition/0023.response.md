The code snippet provided is `print('NO')`. This line of code prints the string 'NO' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. However, according to the initial state, if 'NO' has been printed, the program has been terminated. 

Given that `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not 'South', and considering the conditions under which 'NO' is printed (which typically would relate to `curr_lat` being out of range or other termination conditions), we should consider why 'NO' is being printed in this context. 

Since `curr_lat` is exactly 90 and the initial conditions specify that if `curr_lat` is within the range -90 to 90 the program continues, printing 'NO' and terminating the program in this specific scenario suggests an edge case condition is being met or the program's logic is being forcibly exited, possibly due to external conditions not directly stated in the initial conditions.

Therefore, considering the information provided:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `t_{i}` remains a positive integer.
- `dir_{i}` remains one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East".
- `t` remains an integer.
- `dir` remains an input direction string not equal to 'South'.
- `curr_lat` is specifically 90.
- The program has printed 'NO' and has terminated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` is 90, the program has printed 'NO' and has terminated.**
