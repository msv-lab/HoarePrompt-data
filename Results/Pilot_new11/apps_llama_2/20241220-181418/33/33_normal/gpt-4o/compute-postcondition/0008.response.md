The code sets `valid` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still an input integer greater than 0, `n` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is 'North', `position` is less than `t`, and now `valid` is `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is 'North', `position` is an integer and `position` is less than `t`, and `valid` is `False`**
