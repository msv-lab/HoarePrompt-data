Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n` pairs of values must exist for the loop to execute one more time, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `valid` and `position` depend on the conditions related to `dir`, `t`, and the new `position` as initially specified, considering the directions 'North', 'South', 'West', and 'East' with their respective effects on `position` and `valid`.***
