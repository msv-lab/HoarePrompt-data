Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n` pairs of values must exist for the loop to execute one more time, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string, if `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `position` remains unchanged and `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `position` and `valid` is determined by the conditions related to `dir` and `t` as specified.***
