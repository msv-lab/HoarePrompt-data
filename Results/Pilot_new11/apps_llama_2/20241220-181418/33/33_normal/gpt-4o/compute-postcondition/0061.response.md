Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries, and the current value of `position` is not 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once, and `valid` is False if any movement or condition made it so, otherwise True.**
