Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string. If `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then if `position` is 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`. If `dir` is neither 'West' nor 'East', then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.***
