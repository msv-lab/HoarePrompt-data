Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string, `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', if `position` is 0 or 20000, then `valid` is False, otherwise, the state of `valid` is unchanged, and the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `position` remain as initially described in the precondition.***
