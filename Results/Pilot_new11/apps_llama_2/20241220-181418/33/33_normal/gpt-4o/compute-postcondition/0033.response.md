The value of `position` is decreased by `t`, where `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `position` becomes `position - t`. If `position - t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string, `position` is `position - t`, if `position - t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`**
