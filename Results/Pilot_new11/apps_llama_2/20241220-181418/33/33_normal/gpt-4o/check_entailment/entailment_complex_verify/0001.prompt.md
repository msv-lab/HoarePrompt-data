You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
    if position != 0:
        valid = False
    if valid:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a correct implementation of the problem description. It checks all the conditions specified in the problem: 

- If Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South.
- If Limak is at the South Pole, he can only move North.
- Limak must end at the North Pole.

The program initializes a variable `position` to 0, representing the North Pole. It then iterates through each instruction, updating the `position` variable based on the direction and distance of the instruction. 

The program also checks for invalid moves, such as moving North from the North Pole or moving South from the South Pole, and updates the `valid` flag accordingly. 

Finally, the program checks if Limak ends at the North Pole by verifying if the `position` variable is 0 after all instructions have been processed. If the `position` variable is not 0 or if any invalid moves were made, the program prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including cases where Limak moves in a direction that would take him beyond the North or South Pole, and cases where Limak ends at a position other than the North Pole. 

I have analyzed the code and all the examples provided, and I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function has access to the input data, which is an integer n representing the number of parts in the journey and n pairs of values, where each pair consists of a non-negative integer t_i representing the distance to be traveled and a string dir_i representing the direction, which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute, and `valid` is False if any movement or condition made it so, otherwise True.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute. If `position` is not 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, the state of `valid` remains unchanged as there is no else part to alter it.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute. If `position` is not 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, then 'YES' has been printed to the console and `valid` is `True`, otherwise 'NO' has been printed to the console and `valid` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a journey, defined by a sequence of steps with given distances and directions, ends at the starting point without exceeding certain boundaries or violating specific conditions. It accepts the number of steps and then the distance and direction for each step, validating the inputs and updating the position accordingly. The function checks for boundary conditions (position between 0 and 20000) and direction constraints (not moving West or East when at the boundary positions 0 or 20000). It returns 'YES' if the journey is valid and ends at the starting point, indicating that all steps were successfully processed without any violations, and 'NO' otherwise, indicating that at least one condition was not met. The function handles edge cases such as negative positions, exceeding the maximum position of 20000, moving West or East from boundary positions, and journey paths that do not return to the origin, adjusting the validation flag 'valid' based on these conditions. After execution, the program's state reflects the outcome of the journey validation, with 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console and the 'valid' flag set accordingly. The final state does not modify the input data but rather evaluates the journey based on the provided steps, giving a clear indication of whether the journey adheres to the predefined rules and constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
