You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

-----Note-----

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function has access to the input data, which is an integer n representing the number of parts in the journey and n pairs of values, where each pair consists of a non-negative integer t_i representing the distance to be traveled and a string dir_i representing the direction, which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute, and `valid` is False if any movement or condition made it so, otherwise True.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute. If `position` is not 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, the state of `valid` remains unchanged as there is no else part to alter it.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` and `dir` are the last input values if the loop executed, `position` is between -n*max(t) and 20000 + n*max(t) if all movements were valid and did not exceed boundaries or is 0 if the loop did not execute. If `position` is not 0, then `valid` is `False`. If `position` is 0, then 'YES' has been printed to the console and `valid` is `True`, otherwise 'NO' has been printed to the console and `valid` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether a journey, defined by a sequence of steps with given distances and directions, ends at the starting point without exceeding certain boundaries or violating specific conditions. It accepts the number of steps and then the distance and direction for each step, validating the inputs and updating the position accordingly. The function checks for boundary conditions (position between 0 and 20000) and direction constraints (not moving West or East when at the boundary positions 0 or 20000). It returns 'YES' if the journey is valid and ends at the starting point, indicating that all steps were successfully processed without any violations, and 'NO' otherwise, indicating that at least one condition was not met. The function handles edge cases such as negative positions, exceeding the maximum position of 20000, moving West or East from boundary positions, and journey paths that do not return to the origin, adjusting the validation flag 'valid' based on these conditions. After execution, the program's state reflects the outcome of the journey validation, with 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console and the 'valid' flag set accordingly. The final state does not modify the input data but rather evaluates the journey based on the provided steps, giving a clear indication of whether the journey adheres to the predefined rules and constraints.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
