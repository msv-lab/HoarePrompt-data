To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the given code on the variables `x`, `normalized_angle`, and the new variable `turns`.

1. `x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18. This condition remains unchanged as the code does not modify `x`.

2. `normalized_angle` is an integer between -359 and 359, inclusive, representing the normalized camera rotation, calculated as `x % 360`. This condition also remains unchanged since the code does not modify `normalized_angle`.

3. `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This line calculates the number of turns based on the `normalized_angle`. 

Given that `normalized_angle` is between -359 and 359, let's analyze the calculation:

- `(360 - normalized_angle)` will give a value between 1 and 719 because when `normalized_angle` is -359, `(360 - (-359)) = 719`, and when `normalized_angle` is 359, `(360 - 359) = 1`.

- `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90` will then divide this range by 90, resulting in values between 0 (for `normalized_angle` = 359) and 7 (for `normalized_angle` = -359), considering integer division.

- Finally, `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` will give the remainder when the above result is divided by 4, leading to possible values of 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the `normalized_angle`.

Therefore, `turns` is assigned a value that represents the number of quarters of a full turn needed to reach a specific orientation, starting from the current `normalized_angle`, and is always one of 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Since the calculation of `turns` does not alter `x` or `normalized_angle`, and given the range and dependency on `normalized_angle`, the output state remains as follows:

- `x` is an integer representing the camera angle in degrees, where -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.
- `normalized_angle` is an integer between -359 and 359, inclusive, representing the normalized camera rotation, calculated as `x % 360`.
- `turns` is an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive, representing the quarters of a turn needed based on `normalized_angle`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, and `turns` is `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`**
