The code `print(turns)` simply prints the value of `turns` but does not modify any variables. The value of `turns` is still `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, and `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, `turns` is `(360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4` and the value of `turns` has been printed.
Output State: **`x` is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18, `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`, `turns` is `(360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4` and the value of `turns` has been printed**
