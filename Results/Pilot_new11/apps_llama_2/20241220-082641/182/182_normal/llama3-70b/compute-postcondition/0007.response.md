The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it is mentioned that there is a constraint related to a camera angle, which is an integer in the range -10^18 to 10^18, with positive values denoting clockwise camera rotation and negative values denoting counter-clockwise rotation. Since the function does not explicitly accept any parameters, it seems there might be an omission in the problem statement as the function is defined without any parameters but there's a description of a parameter constraint.


Given the information provided and assuming the camera angle is indeed a parameter that should be passed to the function, a corrected interpretation would be:


The function `func` should accept a parameter, let's denote it as `camera_angle`, which is an integer in the range -10^18 to 10^18. The function returns a value based on this `camera_angle`, but the specific return values or conditions are not provided in the problem statement.


Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `camera_angle` and return a value based on the camera angle, which denotes the direction of camera rotation. However, without explicit details on the return conditions or values, we can't specify the return behavior accurately.


Functionality: **The function accepts an integer camera_angle and returns a value based on the camera angle.**
