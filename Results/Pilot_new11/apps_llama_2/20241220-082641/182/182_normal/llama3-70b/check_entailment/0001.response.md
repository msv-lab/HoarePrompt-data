Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes the camera angle in degrees as input, which can be positive (clockwise) or negative (counter-clockwise).
2. The program normalizes the input angle by taking the modulus of the angle with 360, which ensures that the angle is within the range of -360 to 360 degrees.
3. The program then checks if the normalized angle is 0. If it is, the program prints 0, which means no rotation is needed.
4. If the normalized angle is not 0, the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical.

The formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is used to calculate the minimum number of rotations. This formula works as follows:

- `x + 90` shifts the angle to the right, so that the minimum deviation is achieved when the result is a multiple of 90.
- `- 1` is used to handle the case where `x + 90` is exactly a multiple of 90, in which case we need to rotate one less time.
- `// 90` divides the result by 90, effectively counting the number of 90-degree rotations needed.
- `% 4` ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to 3, which corresponds to the minimum number of rotations needed to achieve the minimum deviation.

The program handles both positive and negative input angles correctly, and it also handles the case where the input angle is a multiple of 360 degrees.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, I couldn't find any cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
