Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function appears to correctly implement the required logic to determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum. 

Here is a breakdown of how the function works:

1. The input angle `x` is taken modulo 360 to reduce it to the range [-360, 360), which is equivalent to [0, 360) due to the nature of angles.

2. If the angle is 0, the function prints 0, which is correct since no rotation is needed in this case.

3. For non-zero angles, the function calculates the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary using the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This expression first adjusts the angle to find the nearest multiple of 90 that is greater than the angle, then calculates the number of 90 degrees turns required to reach this multiple, and finally takes the result modulo 4 to ensure it falls within the range [0, 4), which corresponds to the possible number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.

The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by this function. For instance, for an input of 60, the function correctly outputs 1, and for an input of -60, it correctly outputs 3.

After analyzing the function and considering possible edge cases, it appears that the function works correctly for all possible input values within the specified range of -10^18 to 10^18. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
