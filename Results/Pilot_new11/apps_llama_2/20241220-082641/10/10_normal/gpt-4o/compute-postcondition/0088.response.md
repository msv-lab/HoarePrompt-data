Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 1. If `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j`, then `left_count[d]` is increased by 1. Additionally, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is increased by 1, otherwise `right_count[d]` remains unchanged. If the condition `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j` is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `right_count[d]` being increased by 1 if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, and remaining unchanged otherwise.***
