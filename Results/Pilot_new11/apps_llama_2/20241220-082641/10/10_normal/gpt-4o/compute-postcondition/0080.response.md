Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 0. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count[d]` is `top_count[d] + 1`. The values of `left_count[d]`, `right_count[d]`, and `bottom_count[d]` remain unchanged as their updates depend on the conditions related to `x1`, `x2`, `x1_j`, `x2_j`, `y1`, and `y2` relative to each other, and only the condition for `top_count[d]` has been met in this case. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[d]` is `left_count[d] + 1`. If previously `x1` was less than `x1_j` and `x2` was less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is `right_count[d] + 1`. Additionally, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[d]` is incremented by 1, but this condition is not met in the given if part, thus `bottom_count[d]` remains the same.**
