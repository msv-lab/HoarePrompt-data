Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` equals `d`, `j` equals 2, and if `i` equals `j`, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise no changes are made.**
