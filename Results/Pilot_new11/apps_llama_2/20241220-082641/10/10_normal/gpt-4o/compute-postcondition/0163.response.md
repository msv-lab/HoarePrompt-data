The code `break` indicates that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `right_count`, `left_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` are lists of `d` integers, `target_sofa` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
