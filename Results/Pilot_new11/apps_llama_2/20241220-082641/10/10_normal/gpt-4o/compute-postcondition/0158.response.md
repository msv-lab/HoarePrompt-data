The value of `target_sofa` is updated to `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `target_sofa` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `right_count`, `left_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` are lists of `d` integers, `target_sofa` is 2.
