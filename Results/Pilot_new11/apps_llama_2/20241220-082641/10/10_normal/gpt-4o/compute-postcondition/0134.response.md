Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `left_count[d+1]` remains unchanged, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count[d+1]` remains unchanged, and `right_count` remains unchanged. If the condition `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j` is not met, the state remains unchanged, meaning `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[d+1]`, and `right_count` are unchanged, still maintaining the initial conditions related to `x1`, `x2`, `x1_j`, `x2_j` for `left_count` and `right_count` updates.***
