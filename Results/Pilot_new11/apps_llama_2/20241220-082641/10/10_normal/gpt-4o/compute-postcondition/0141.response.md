The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `d` is still at least 3, `n` and `m` are still input integers, `sofas` is still a list of at least `d+1` tuples. The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are still the same as before, and the program is still skipping to the next iteration of the most internal loop if `i` equals `j`, otherwise it continues with the next statements. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j` = `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` = `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` = `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` = `sofas[j][3]`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the next statements.
Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j` = `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` = `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` = `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` = `sofas[j][3]`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the next statements.**
