The code assigns the values of four input integers to the variables `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`. The previous values of `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are replaced by these new input values. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl` is an input integer, `cntr` is an input integer, `cntt` is an input integer, `cntb` is an input integer with `cntl` = `cnt_l`, `cntr` = `cnt_r`, `cntt` = `cnt_t`, `cntb` = `cnt_b`**
