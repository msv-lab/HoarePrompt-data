The given Python code snippet is executed based on the initial state. 

The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are updated to be the elements of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The condition for `i` equals `j` is still valid to skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop if true, otherwise the program continues with the next statements.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas` where `j` is `d-1`, and if `i` equals `j`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the next statements.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j` = `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` = `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` = `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` = `sofas[j][3]`, and if `i` equals `j`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the next statements**
