The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned from the tuple at index `i` in the `sofas` list. Since `i` is equal to `d`, this will be the last tuple in the list (as list indices in Python are 0-based). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`.**
