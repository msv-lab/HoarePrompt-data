The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The initial conditions regarding `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]`, and the conditions related to `right_count[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the `j-th` tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the state remains unchanged**
