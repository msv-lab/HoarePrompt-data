The value of `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `target_sofa` becomes 0 + 1 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`d` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `right_count`, `left_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` are lists of `d` integers, the current value of `left_count` at index `i` equals `cntl`, the current value of `right_count` at index `i` equals `cntr`, the current value of `top_count` at index `i` equals `cntt`, and the current value of `bottom_count` at index `i` equals `cntb`, `target_sofa` is 1**
