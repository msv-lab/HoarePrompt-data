You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j:
                right_count[i] += 1
            if x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j:
                left_count[i] += 1
            if y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j:
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic for counting the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa.

For example, consider a scenario with two sofas: one at (1, 1) and (1, 2), and the other at (2, 2) and (2, 3). The first sofa should have one sofa to its right, but the program will incorrectly count it as having no sofas to its right.

The issue lies in the conditions used to update the left_count, right_count, top_count, and bottom_count arrays. The current conditions only check if the coordinates of the current sofa are less than or greater than the coordinates of the other sofa, but they do not consider the actual positions of the sofas relative to each other.

To correctly implement the logic, the program should check if there exists a cell in the current sofa that is to the left, right, top, or bottom of a cell in the other sofa. This can be achieved by checking the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of each sofa and comparing them to determine the relative positions.

Here is an example of how the corrected conditions could look:

```python
for i in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
    x_min, x_max = min(x1, x2), max(x1, x2)
    y_min, y_max = min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2)
    for j in range(d):
        if i == j:
            continue
        (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
        x_min_j, x_max_j = min(x1_j, x2_j), max(x1_j, x2_j)
        y_min_j, y_max_j = min(y1_j, y2_j), max(y1_j, y2_j)
        if x_min_j > x_max:
            right_count[i] += 1
        if x_min > x_max_j:
            left_count[i] += 1
        if y_min_j > y_max:
            bottom_count[i] += 1
        if y_min > y_max_j:
            top_count[i] += 1
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are integer variables d, n, m, representing the number of sofas in the storehouse, and the size of the storehouse respectively. There is a list of d sofas, each sofa represented by four integer coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) with 1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m, the cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) have a common side, and no cell is covered by more than one sofa. Additionally, there are four integer variables cntl, cntr, cntt, cntb with 0 ≤ cntl, cntr, cntt, cntb ≤ d - 1, representing the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the target sofa, respectively, with 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5.

    print(target_sofa)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input parameters, including the number of sofas (d), storehouse dimensions (n and m), a list of sofa coordinates, and counts of adjacent sofas (cntl, cntr, cntt, cntb). It calculates the actual counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa and compares these counts with the input counts to find a target sofa that matches the given counts. If such a sofa is found, the function prints its index plus one; otherwise, it prints -1. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list of sofas (d = 0) and cases where no sofa matches the given counts. However, the function does not perform any error handling for invalid input, such as non-integer values, negative numbers, or coordinates outside the storehouse dimensions. It also assumes that the input list of sofa coordinates does not contain any duplicate or overlapping sofas, as stated in the initial annotations.
