The original assessment is accurate, and I maintain that the program is correct. The output hints do not provide any information that contradicts the original assessment or the problem description. They do mention potential edge cases that the function does not handle, such as non-numeric input or input values outside the specified range, but this is not relevant to the program's correctness since we assume the input will always be valid.

The output hints also state that the function does not return any value, instead, it prints the result directly. This is consistent with the problem description, which asks to print the corresponding expression, not to return it.

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program's functionality, including input handling, expression calculation, finding the maximum value, and printing the corresponding expression. The examples provided demonstrate the program's ability to handle different inputs and select the correct expression corresponding to the maximum calculated value.

The program's logic is sound, and it implements the required functionality correctly. The output hints do not provide any evidence that the program does not meet the problem description, and therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
