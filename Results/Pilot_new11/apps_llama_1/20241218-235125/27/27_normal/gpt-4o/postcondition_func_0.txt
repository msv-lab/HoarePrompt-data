This function reads three positive real numbers, x, y, and z, from standard input, with each number having exactly one digit after the decimal point and being between 0.1 and 200.0 (inclusive). It calculates 12 different expressions involving exponentiation of x, y, and z, determines the maximum value among these expressions, and prints the string representation of the expression that yields this maximum value. The function does not explicitly accept parameters, instead relying on input from the user through the standard input stream. The function's output is the string representation of the expression that results in the maximum calculated value, potentially handling cases where the maximum value could be the result of multiple expressions, in which case it will print the first encountered expression that yields this maximum value. The state of the program after execution includes the written output of the expression with the maximum calculated value, with the input values x, y, and z being consumed from the standard input stream.
