`max_value` is assigned the value of the maximum mathematical expression from the list `expressions`, and `max_expr` is assigned the corresponding string representation of this maximum mathematical expression. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `max_value` equals the maximum value of the first elements of the tuples in `expressions` (which are the mathematical expressions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`), and the value of `max_expr` equals the second element of the tuple in `expressions` that has the maximum value of the first element. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are the three input floating point numbers, `expressions` is a list of 12 tuples, `max_value` equals the maximum mathematical expression from `expressions`, and `max_expr` equals the string representation of `max_value`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are the three input floating point numbers, `expressions` is a list of 12 tuples, `max_value` equals the maximum mathematical expression from `expressions`, and `max_expr` equals the string representation of `max_value`.**
