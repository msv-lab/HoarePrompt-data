The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console. This operation does not modify any variables. 

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers, and the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`. 

Since the print operation does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, or `y`, and does not change the fact that the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that it now includes the fact that 'No' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers, the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`, and 'No' has been printed**
