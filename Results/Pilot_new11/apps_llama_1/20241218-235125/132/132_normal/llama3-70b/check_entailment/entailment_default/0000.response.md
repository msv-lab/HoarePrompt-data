Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to determine whether the notes of the number of stones in piles can be correct or not, given that the jury members can either take one stone from a pile or move one stone from one pile to another.

The code checks if the total number of stones is the same on both days, and if so, it sorts the lists of stones and compares them. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the jury members can move stones from one pile to another.

A counterexample to the code is the following input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

The code will output 'Yes' because the total number of stones is the same and the sorted lists are equal. However, this is incorrect because the jury members would need to move stones from one pile to another to achieve the second distribution, which is allowed according to the problem description.

Another issue with the code is that it only checks if the sorted lists are equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the distributions are the same. The code should check if there exists a sequence of moves (taking one stone from a pile or moving one stone from one pile to another) that can transform the first distribution into the second distribution.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem, and its output may not always agree with the problem description.
