The function `func` does not seem to have any parameters defined. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it appears that the function should accept a positive integer `n` and two lists of non-negative integers `x` and `y`, each of length `n`. 

Given the constraints: 
- `n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 50.
- `x` and `y` are lists of non-negative integers, each of length `n`, where 0 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000 for all `i`.

However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. For the purpose of describing the functionality based on the constraints given:

The function `func` should accept parameters `n`, `x`, and `y` where `n` is a positive integer, and `x` and `y` are lists of non-negative integers of length `n`. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function should accept parameters n, x, and y where n is a positive integer, and x and y are lists of non-negative integers of length n.**
