The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans` to the console, but it does not change the values of any variables. The value of `ans` is still `1` plus the number of transitions between different characters in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is `1` plus the number of transitions between different characters in `s`, and the value of `ans` has been printed.**
