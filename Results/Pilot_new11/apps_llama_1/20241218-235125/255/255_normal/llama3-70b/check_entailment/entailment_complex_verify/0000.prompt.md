You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string $s$ by applying the given operation.

Here's why it works:

- The operation allows deleting a contiguous substring of equal characters. 
- The program iterates through the string $s$ and increments the `ans` counter whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. 
- This effectively counts the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string, as each operation can delete a contiguous substring of equal characters.

For example, if we have the string "abaca", the program correctly outputs 3, because we can delete the string in 3 operations: "a", "b", and "aca" (where "aca" can be deleted in one operation because the 'a's are contiguous, but here the 'c' is different so 'a' 'c' 'a' is three different operations 'a' then 'c' then 'a'). 

However in the case of "abaca" this works because the operations would be 'a' then 'b' then 'a' 'c' 'a' but 'a' 'c' 'a' can be done in 3 operations: 'a', 'c', 'a'. 

So it seems to work for every potential case, and the provided examples also support the correctness of the program. 

This program assumes that a single character is considered as a valid substring and can be deleted in one operation, which aligns with the problem description. 

So, after considering various potential cases, it seems that the program works as expected and follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the input string, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is `1` plus the number of transitions between different characters in `s`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters from the user, counts the number of transitions between different characters in `s` and prints the result, which is `1` plus the number of transitions. It does not return any value. The function assumes that the input string `s` only contains lowercase Latin letters and that the input integer `n` is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), but it does not validate these assumptions. If the input string `s` is empty or contains non-lowercase Latin letters, or if the input integer `n` is outside the specified range, the function's behavior is not defined. After the function concludes, the program's state is that it has printed the count of character transitions in the input string `s`, and the input variables `n` and `s` have been consumed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
