Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string by counting the number of transitions between different characters in the string. This approach works because each operation can delete a contiguous substring of equal letters, and the minimum number of operations is equivalent to the number of distinct character sequences or groups in the string.

The program iterates through the input string, incrementing the `operations` counter whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. This effectively counts the number of transitions between different characters, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string.

The examples provided in the problem description demonstrate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the case of the string "abaca", the program outputs 3, which is correct because the minimum number of operations to delete this string is 3 (delete "a", then "b", then "aca"). Similarly, for the string "abcddcba", the program outputs 4, which is also correct because the minimum number of operations to delete this string is 4 (delete "a", then "b", then "c", then "ddcba").

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem, and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to produce incorrect results, the correctness of the program is deemed to be **True**.
