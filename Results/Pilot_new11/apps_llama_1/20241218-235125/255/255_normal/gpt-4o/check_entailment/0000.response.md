Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string $s$. The logic is based on the fact that in one operation, a contiguous substring of equal letters can be deleted. Therefore, the program simply counts the number of transitions between different letters in the string, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

- It iterates over the string, checking each character against the previous one.
- Whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one, it increments the `operations` counter.
- This effectively counts the number of distinct "blocks" of the same letter in the string, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required to delete the string, given that each operation can delete a contiguous block of the same letter.

The initial value of `operations` is set to 1, which accounts for the first block of letters in the string. This ensures that the program correctly counts the number of operations even if the string consists of a single block (i.e., all characters are the same).

For example, given the input string "abaca", the program correctly outputs 3, because it identifies three distinct blocks of letters: "a", "b", and "aca" (where "a" and "ca" are considered as separate blocks due to the intervening "b"). Similarly, for the input string "abcddcba", the program outputs 4, reflecting the four distinct blocks: "a", "b", "cddc", and "b" (again, treating each transition as the start of a new block).

Overall, the program's logic aligns well with the problem description, and it correctly handles the examples provided. Without finding a specific case where the program fails to meet the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
