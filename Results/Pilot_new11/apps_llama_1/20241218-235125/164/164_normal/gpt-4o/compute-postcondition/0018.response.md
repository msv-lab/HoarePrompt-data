Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`. If `line[pos]` equals '#', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution as `line[pos]` is not '#'.***
