The code snippet is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. 

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos + k`, `reachable` is either True or False depending on whether the previous `pos` was equal to `T_pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
