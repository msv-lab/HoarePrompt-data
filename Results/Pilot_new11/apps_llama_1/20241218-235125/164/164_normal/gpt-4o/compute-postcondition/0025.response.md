The code sets `reachable` to `True`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos + k`, and `reachable` is True**
