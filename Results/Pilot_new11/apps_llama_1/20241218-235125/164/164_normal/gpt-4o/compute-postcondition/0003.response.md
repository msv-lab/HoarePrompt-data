The code `T_pos = line.index('T')` assigns the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `line` to the variable `T_pos`. The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`. 

The values of `n`, `k`, `line`, and `G_pos` do not change, so they remain as they were. 

The new variable `T_pos` is now equal to the index of the first 'T' in the string `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is an input string, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`**
