The `break` statement does not modify any variables but terminates the loop it is directly inside of. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `reachable` is `False`, `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, the current value of `line` at position `pos` is '#', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
