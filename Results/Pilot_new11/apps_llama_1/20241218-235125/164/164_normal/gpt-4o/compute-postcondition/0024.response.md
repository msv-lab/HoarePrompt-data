Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` is defined based on the positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` and is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `pos` is `G_pos + k`, `reachable` is either True or False, and if `line[pos]` equals '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state remains as before the if statement execution.**
