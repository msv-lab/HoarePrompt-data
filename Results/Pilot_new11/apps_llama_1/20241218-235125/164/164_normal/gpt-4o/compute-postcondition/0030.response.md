The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the states of `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and `reachable` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is an input string containing both 'G' and 'T', `G_pos` and `T_pos` are defined based on the original positions of 'G' and 'T' in `line` with `G_pos` less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and 'YES' has been printed to the console**
