Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It only checks if there is a path from the grasshopper to the insect by jumping in one direction (to the right) with a step size of `k`. However, the problem description states that the grasshopper can jump in both directions (to the left and to the right) with a step size of `k`.

For example, if the input is:

```
6 2
G....T
```

The program will print "NO" because it only checks in one direction (to the right). However, the grasshopper can actually jump to the left with a step size of 2 and then jump to the right with a step size of 2 to reach the insect.

A correct implementation would require using a graph traversal algorithm (such as BFS or DFS) to explore all possible jumping paths from the grasshopper to the insect, taking into account jumps in both directions. 

Here's an example of how this could be implemented in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited.add(G_pos)

    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        for next_pos in [pos + k, pos - k]:
            if 0 <= next_pos < n and next_pos not in visited and line[next_pos] in ['.', 'T']:
                queue.append(next_pos)
                visited.add(next_pos)

    print('NO')

func()
```

This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible jumping paths from the grasshopper to the insect. It keeps track of the positions that have already been visited to avoid revisiting them and to ensure that the algorithm terminates. If the insect's position is reached, the function prints "YES" and returns. If all possible positions have been visited and the insect's position has not been reached, the function prints "NO".
