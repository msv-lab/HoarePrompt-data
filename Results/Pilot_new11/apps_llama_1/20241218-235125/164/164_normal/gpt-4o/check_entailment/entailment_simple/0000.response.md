Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it only checks if there is a path from 'G' to 'T' with step 'k' without encountering '#' when 'G' is to the left of 'T' or when 'G' and 'T' are at a distance that is a multiple of 'k'. However, the problem description states that the grasshopper can jump to any empty cell that is exactly 'k' cells away from the current cell, to the left or to the right. 

This means that the program should also check for paths where 'T' is to the left of 'G' and where the distance between 'G' and 'T' is not a multiple of 'k', but there is still a path with a series of jumps of length 'k'.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper can jump over obstacles. It breaks the loop as soon as it encounters an obstacle, which is incorrect. The program should continue checking for a path even if there is an obstacle at a position that is 'k' away from the current position.

To correctly solve the problem, a graph traversal algorithm such as BFS or DFS should be used, which would allow the program to explore all possible paths from 'G' to 'T' and check if there is a path that consists of jumps of length 'k' without encountering '#'. 

Here is a correct Python solution for the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited = {G_pos}
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        
        for jump in [pos - k, pos + k]:
            if 0 <= jump < n and line[jump]!= '#' and jump not in visited:
                queue.append(jump)
                visited.add(jump)
    
    print('NO')

func()
```

This program uses a queue to keep track of the positions to visit next and a set to keep track of the visited positions. It starts from the position of 'G' and explores all possible jumps of length 'k'. If it reaches the position of 'T', it prints 'YES'. If it has explored all possible positions and has not reached 'T', it prints 'NO'.
