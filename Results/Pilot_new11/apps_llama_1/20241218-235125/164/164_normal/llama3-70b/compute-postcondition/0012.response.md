The code `g = i` assigns the value of `i` to `g`. Since `i` is 1, `g` is now also 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and `t` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, `g` is 1, `t` depends on the character at index 1 of string `s`**
