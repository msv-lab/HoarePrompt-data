The function `func` accepts parameters `n` and `k` and a string of length `n`. `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive). The string consists of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, representing the initial position of the grasshopper and the target insect, respectively, and '.' and '#' represent empty cells and obstacles, respectively. 

However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not explicitly include these parameters. Assuming the parameters should be included in the function definition for clarity, it should be `def func(n, k, string):`. 

Given the parameters, the function should return a value based on the interaction between the grasshopper, the target insect, and the environment defined by the string.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and a string, where n is the length of the string and the environment, k is the hop size of the grasshopper, and the string represents the initial positions of the grasshopper, the target insect, empty cells, and obstacles, and returns a value based on the parameters and the string.**
