The value of `g` is updated to `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `g` is 0, the initial value of `t` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `g` is 0, `t` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G'**
