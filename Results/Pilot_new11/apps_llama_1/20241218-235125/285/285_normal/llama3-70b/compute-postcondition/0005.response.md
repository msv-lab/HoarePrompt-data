The code `print('YES')` prints 'YES' to the console but doesn't modify the values of any variables. Therefore, the states of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the relationships between them remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1 and `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 1. The current value of `c` is `n // 1234`. `a` is 0 and `b` is 0. The expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, and 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
