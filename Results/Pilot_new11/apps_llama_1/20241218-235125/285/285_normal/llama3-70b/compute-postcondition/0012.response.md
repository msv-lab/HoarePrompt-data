Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 123456) // 1234`, `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1, and `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 2. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with its current state.***
