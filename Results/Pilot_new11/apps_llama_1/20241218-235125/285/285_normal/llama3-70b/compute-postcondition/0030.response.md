Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 1357123) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' has been printed and the program has exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
