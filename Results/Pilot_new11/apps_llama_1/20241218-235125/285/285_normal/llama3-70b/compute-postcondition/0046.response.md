The print statement prints 'YES' to the console, but does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change. 
The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`, `a` is still 2, `b` is still 1, and `c` is still `(n - 2591590) // 1234`. 
We printed 'YES' to the console.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 2591590) // 1234` and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
