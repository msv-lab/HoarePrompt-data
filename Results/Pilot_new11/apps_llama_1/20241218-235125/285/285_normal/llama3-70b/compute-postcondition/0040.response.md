Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `k` is `n - 2 * 1234567`, `c` is `k // 1234` and is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `n` is equal to `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, which means that the relationship between `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` is satisfied.**
