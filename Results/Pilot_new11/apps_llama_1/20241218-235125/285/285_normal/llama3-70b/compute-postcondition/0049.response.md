To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`
- `a` is 2
- `b` is 1
- `c` is `(n - 2591590) // 1234`

Given loop statement:
```python
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
```

The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `b` will be incremented to 2.

Given that `a` remains unchanged (since it's not modified within the loop's scope based on the given information) and `n`'s relationship with `a`, `b`, and `c` through the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`, for `b` being incremented, `c` would need to adjust accordingly if the equation were to hold true for the new value of `b`. However, since the task is to understanding the program state at the start of the for loop and not after the loop body has been executed, we focus on the increment of `b`.

The condition for `n` being greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567` does not directly influence the increment of `b` but ensures that the loop has the potential to start and run for at least some iterations. The value of `c` is dependent on `n` and the current values of `a` and `b`, but its adjustment isn't directly relevant to the loop's continuation condition based on `b`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `c` is `(n - 2591590) // 1234`**
