The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. 'YES' is already printed to the console. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 2591590) // 1234`, 'YES' is printed to the console, and the program has terminated.
