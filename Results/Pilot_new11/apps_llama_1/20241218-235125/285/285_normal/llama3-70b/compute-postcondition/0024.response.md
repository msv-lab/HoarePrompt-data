The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that no further code will be executed, and the program will stop running. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c` do not change. The string 'YES' has been printed before the program exited.


Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0, `c` is the integer result of `(n - 1234567) // 1234`, `n` equals `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, the string 'YES' has been printed, and the program has terminated.**
