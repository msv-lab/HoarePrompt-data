The function takes an integer input from the user, checks if the number can be represented as a sum of multiples of 1234567, 123456, and 1234, and prints 'YES' if such a representation exists, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value, it only prints the result to the console. The input integer is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If the input is outside of this range, the function may not behave as expected. The function's execution terminates when it finds a valid representation or exhausts all possible combinations, at which point it prints the result and terminates.
