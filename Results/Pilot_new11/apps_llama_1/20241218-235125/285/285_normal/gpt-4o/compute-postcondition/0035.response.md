According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a` and the expression `n // house_cost + 1`. If `a` is less than `n // house_cost + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be increased by 1, so `a` is 2. The loop will execute as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // house_cost`, so for the loop to execute again, `n // house_cost` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, the loop either returns 'YES' if there exists a `b` such that `(n - 1234567 - b * 123456)` is divisible by 1234, or it does not return 'YES' if no such `b` exists, and in the latter case, `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, `a`, and `remaining_after_houses` retain their initial values and relationships.**
