According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost`. If `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` is greater than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is greater than 0, and `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` is 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and must be greater than 0, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n` (and thus also equal to `remaining_after_houses`) and must be greater than `car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
