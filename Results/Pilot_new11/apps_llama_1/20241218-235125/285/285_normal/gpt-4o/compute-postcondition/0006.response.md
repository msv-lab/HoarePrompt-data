To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `house_cost`.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 0.
- `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and must be greater than 0.
- `b` is 0.

The code is:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```

Given that `b` is 0, the equation simplifies to:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 0 * car_cost
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses
```

Since `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567) and also must be greater than 0, and given that `house_cost` is a specific value, the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` implies that `n` (and thus `remaining_after_houses` and now `remaining_after_cars`) is at least 1234567.

The other variables (`house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, `a`, `b`) do not change value in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567).
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 0.
- `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and must be greater than 0.
- `b` is 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n` (and thus also equal to `remaining_after_houses`) and must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and must be greater than 0, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n` (and thus also equal to `remaining_after_houses`) and must be greater than 0**
