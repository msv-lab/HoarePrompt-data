Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements in the problem description. 

The problem statement requires that each plate should contain at least `x` pieces of cake, and no plate should contain pieces of both cakes. However, the condition `a - x + (b - x) >= x` in the program does not guarantee this.

The condition `a - x + (b - x) >= x` is equivalent to `a + b - 2*x >= x`, which simplifies to `a + b >= 3*x`. This condition does not ensure that each plate will have at least `x` pieces of cake, because it considers the total number of pieces in both cakes, rather than the distribution of pieces across the plates.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the maximum `x` such that we can distribute the cakes into `n` plates, with each plate having at least `x` pieces of cake, and no plate having pieces of both cakes. This can be done by using a different condition, such as checking if we can distribute `a` and `b` into two groups of plates, each with at least `x` pieces of cake.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    for x in range(min(a, b), 0, -1):
        if a % x == 0 and b % x == 0 and a // x + b // x <= n:
            print(x)
            break
```
This program checks for each possible `x` from `min(a, b)` down to `1` if it can distribute `a` and `b` into two groups of plates, each with at least `x` pieces of cake, and no plate having pieces of both cakes. The first `x` that meets this condition is the maximum possible value of `x`.
