The code updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. Since `mid = (low + high) // 2`, we can substitute this expression into the update for `low` to get `low = (low + high) // 2 + 1`. The previous relationship `low < high` is still valid, and since `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`, the new `low` is greater than the old `mid`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `high` are not affected. The value of `mid` is not updated in the given code snippet, so its value remains `(low + high) // 2`, but this expression now refers to the old value of `low`, not the new one. 

However, considering the updated `low`, we should express the output state based on the given information without the exact numeric values for `low`, `high`, `mid`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, but considering their relationships. 

Given that `low` is now `mid + 1`, and originally `mid = (low + high) // 2`, the new `low` is essentially the old `mid` incremented by 1. The condition `2 <= n <= a + b` and the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid` before the update are still in place conceptually, but the exact values and their direct relationships are adjusted by the update of `low`. 

Thus, considering the update of `low` and the existing conditions, the Output State reflects the change in `low` while maintaining the other conditions:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `2 <= n <= a + b`, `low` is now `mid + 1` (where `mid` represents the value before the update), `low < high`, and the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid` is altered due to the update of `low`.**
