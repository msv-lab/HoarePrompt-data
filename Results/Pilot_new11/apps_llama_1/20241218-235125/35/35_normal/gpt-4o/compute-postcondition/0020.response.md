The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, with the constraint that 2 <= `n` <= `a` + `b`. After executing the function body, the function returns the number of pieces per plate that is one less than the smallest number of pieces per plate for which distribution is consistently possible. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, and returns the number of pieces per plate that is one less than the smallest number of pieces per plate for which distribution is consistently possible.**
