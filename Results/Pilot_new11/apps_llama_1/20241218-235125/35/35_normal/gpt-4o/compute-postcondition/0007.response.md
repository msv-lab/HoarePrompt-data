Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 2 <= `n` <= `a` + `b`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is True, then `low` is `mid + 1` and `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is False, then `low` is 1 and `high` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, indicating that it is not possible to distribute the cakes with `mid` pieces.**
