The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `2 <= n <= a + b`, `low` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1` (which means `low` is greater than the old `mid`), and `high` remains the same, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` but it has to be recalculated based on the new value of `low`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `2 <= n <= a + b`, `low` is equal to `mid + 1` which was `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is greater than `low`, `mid` needs to be recalculated based on the new `low`.**
