#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of plates, a is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, and b is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 2 <= n <= a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `low` equals `high`, and `low` represents the smallest number of pieces per plate for which `can_distribute` starts to consistently return True, or the point of transition regarding distribution possibility, with `n`, `a`, and `b` retaining their original meanings related to the number of plates and pieces of cakes.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns the number of pieces per plate that is one less than the smallest number of pieces per plate for which distribution is consistently possible, with `n`, `a`, and `b` retaining their original meanings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum number of pieces per plate that can be distributed among 'n' plates when there are 'a' pieces of the first cake and 'b' pieces of the second cake available, such that it is one less than the smallest number of pieces per plate at which the distribution becomes consistently possible. The function assumes that 'n' is a positive integer representing the number of plates, and 'a' and 'b' are positive integers representing the number of pieces of each cake, where the total number of pieces ('a + b') is enough to fill at least 'n' plates with at least 2 pieces each. The function relies on the external function 'can_distribute' to determine the possibility of distributing the cakes with a given number of pieces per plate. The return value represents the point just before the distribution becomes feasible with the given number of plates and cakes, taking into account the binary search logic performed within the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the two cakes, n is a non-negative integer representing the number of plates, and x is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces per plate.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns True if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least x pieces from cakes a and b is greater than or equal to n, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute(x)` checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces from two cakes, represented by the positive integers `a` and `b`, is greater than or equal to a given non-negative integer `n`. It returns `True` if this condition is met and `False` otherwise. However, the function seems to be missing parameters `a`, `b`, and `n`, which are crucial for its operation as described in the annotations. Despite this, the code provided only takes `x` as a parameter, suggesting a potential discrepancy between the intended functionality and the actual implementation. The function's purpose appears to be determining the feasibility of distributing cake pieces into a specified number of plates with a minimum number of pieces per plate, but the actual implementation only considers the distribution based on the provided `x` and implicitly defined `a`, `b`, and `n`, which are not explicitly passed to the function.
