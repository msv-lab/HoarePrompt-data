Correctness: **False**

The program is not following the problem description correctly for every potential case. The issue lies in the way the `can_distribute` function is implemented. This function checks if it's possible to distribute `a` and `b` pieces of cake into plates with at least `x` pieces, but it does not check if the remaining pieces can be distributed into the remaining plates.

For example, consider the input `n = 5, a = 3, b = 4`. The `can_distribute` function will return `True` for `x = 1`, but it's not possible to distribute the cake pieces such that each plate has at least `1` piece and no plate contains pieces of both cakes.

A correct implementation would need to check all possible ways of distributing the cake pieces into plates and ensure that the conditions are met.

Another issue is that the program does not define the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` in the `can_distribute` function, which would cause a `NameError` when trying to run the program. 

The `can_distribute` function should be modified to correctly check if the cake pieces can be distributed into plates with at least `x` pieces, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` should be passed as arguments to this function. 

Here is an example of how the `can_distribute` function could be modified:

```python
def can_distribute(n, a, b, x):
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if a >= i * x and b >= (n - i) * x:
            return True
    return False

def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(n, a, b, mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1
```
