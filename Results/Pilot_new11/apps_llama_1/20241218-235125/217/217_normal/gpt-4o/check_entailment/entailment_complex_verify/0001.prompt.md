You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of B - C by summing up all the positive numbers in sequence a and putting them into sequence b, and summing up all the negative numbers in sequence a and putting them into sequence c. This approach ensures that the sum of elements in sequence b (B) is maximized, and the sum of elements in sequence c (C) is minimized, resulting in the maximum possible value of B - C.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When all numbers in sequence a are positive, the program puts all of them into sequence b, resulting in B being the sum of all numbers in a and C being 0.
* When all numbers in sequence a are negative, the program puts all of them into sequence c, resulting in B being 0 and C being the sum of all numbers in a.
* When sequence a contains both positive and negative numbers, the program puts all the positive numbers into sequence b and all the negative numbers into sequence c, resulting in the maximum possible value of B - C.
* When sequence a contains zeros, the program ignores them when calculating B and C, which is correct because the sum of elements in an empty sequence is 0.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when n is 1, or when all numbers in sequence a are the same.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, so its correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input will be a sequence of operations: the first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum(x for x in a if x > 0)
    C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
    result = B - C
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer n and a sequence of n integers from input, calculates the difference between the sum of all positive integers and the sum of all negative integers in the sequence, and prints the result. The function handles sequences with any combination of positive, negative, and zero integers, and it correctly calculates the result even if the input sequence contains zeros, since zeros are excluded from both the sum of positive and negative integers. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or a sequence length that does not match the specified integer n. After the function concludes, the program state will have been modified by the input and output operations, but the function's local variables (n, a, B, C, result) will no longer be accessible. The output will be the calculated difference between the sum of positive and negative integers in the input sequence.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
