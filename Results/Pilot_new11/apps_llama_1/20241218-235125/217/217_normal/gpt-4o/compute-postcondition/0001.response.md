The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` creates a new list `a` containing integers, where these integers come from the user's input. This input is split into parts (by default, split by spaces) and each part is converted into an integer.

Given the initial state that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, this code does not directly affect `n`. Instead, it introduces a new variable `a` which is a list of integers provided by the user through `input()`.

Since `input().split()` could provide any number of values (including none, if the user enters nothing but spaces or just presses enter), and each of these is converted to an integer, `a` could be any list of integers, depending on the input.

However, the initial state regarding `n` remains unchanged because this code snippet does not modify or use the value of `n` in any way. It only introduces a new variable `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `a` is a list of input integers**
