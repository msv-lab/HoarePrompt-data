The function accepts two lines of input: the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` (-100 ≤ `a_{i}` ≤ 100). After processing the input, the function sorts the `n` integers in descending order and calculates two sums: `b` is the sum of all elements at even indices, and `c` is the sum of all elements at odd indices. The function then returns the difference between `b` and `c` (`b - c`). The final state of the program is that it has printed this difference to the console. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is 1, in which case it will return the single integer, and when `n` is even or odd, in which case it will correctly calculate the sums `b` and `c` based on the sorted list.
