Postcondition: **The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is an odd number (since `i % 2!= 0`), and `i` is 0 is not possible because 0 is even, so `i` is not 0, but since `i` is initially 0 and it can only be an integer, `i` must be at least 1 to be odd, but the condition that `i` is 0 in the precondition takes precedence unless the program has changed `i`, which is not indicated in the given information, therefore, a more accurate statement is: `i` is an odd number greater than or equal to 1 or the initial value of `i` has not been changed and this condition does not apply because the if condition was not met for `i` to be 0, but given `i` must be an odd number for the else block to be executed, we can only conclude `i` is odd, but considering the initial condition `i` is 0, this seems to be a contradiction unless the value of `i` has changed before the conditional statement, however, given the task instructions we must consider `i` is odd and `i` is an integer.**
