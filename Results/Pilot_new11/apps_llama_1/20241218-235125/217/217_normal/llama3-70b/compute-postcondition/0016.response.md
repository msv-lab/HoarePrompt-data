The code increments the value of `c` by the value of `a` at index `i`. The value of `a` at index `i` is an integer between -100 and 100 (inclusive) because `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100.

Given that `i` is `i+1`, this implies that `i` has been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. However, for the purpose of evaluating `a[i]`, we consider the updated value of `i` which is `i+1`. 

The value of `c` after the increment will be `c + a[i]`, where `a[i]` is the integer at index `i` in the list `a`. The exact value of `c` depends on its initial value and the value of `a[i]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected: `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than `i+1` (considering `i` before the increment), `a` is still a list of `n` integers in descending order, and `i` is still `i+1`. 

The parity of `i` after the increment would determine the update of `b` and `c` in subsequent operations, but based on the given code, only `c` is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i` (considering `i` after the increment), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `i` is `i+1`, `c` is `c + a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `i` is `i+1`, `c` is `c + a[i]`.**
