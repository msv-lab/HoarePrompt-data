The code `b += a[i]` increments the value of `b` by the value of `a` at index `i`. The initial value of `i` is 0, which is an even number. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, the value of `a[0]` is the largest integer in the list. The value of `b` is initially 0.

Output State: **The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `b` is equal to `a[0]`, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
