The value of `c` is incremented by `a[i]`. The previous value of `c` depends on whether `i+1` is even or odd. If `i+1` is even, `c` was 0. If `i+1` is odd, `c` was equal to `a[i+1]`. After `i` is updated to `i+1`, if the new `i+1` is even, the old `c` which was `a[i]` (when `i+1` was odd) is now used, if the new `i+1` is odd, `c` which was 0 is now replaced by `a[i+1]`. But since `i` has changed, now new `i+1` is the old `i+2`, thus we now check `i+2`. However, since `c` is now `c + a[i]`, which means the value of `c` after update will be either `a[i+1] + a[i]` or `0 + a[i]`.


Given that `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order and -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i+1`, so after the update `i` is equal to `i+1`, we know that the maximum value of `i+1` is `n-1` because `n` is greater than `i+1` initially and the list has `n` elements.


`n` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is still a list of `n` integers in descending order, `i` has been updated to `i+1`. Given that if `i+1` is even, `b` is equal to `a[0]`, if `i+1` is odd, `b` is 0. This condition still holds, however since `i` has changed, we must recheck this condition for the new value of `i`. The parity of the new `i+1` will determine the value of `b`. If the new `i+1` is even, then `b` is `a[0]`, if the new `i+1` is odd, `b` is 0.


Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, `i` is `i+1`, if the new `i+1` is even, `b` is `a[0]` and `c` is `a[i]`, if the new `i+1` is odd, `b` is 0 and `c` is `a[i+1] + a[i]`.**
