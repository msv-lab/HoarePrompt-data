Postcondition: **The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is an even number because the current value of `i` is 0 and 0 modulus 2 equals 0, which satisfies the if condition `i % 2 == 0`**
