Postcondition: ***the input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `i` is `i+1`. If `i` is even, then if the initial `i+1` was even, `b` is `a[0] + a[i-1]` and `c` is 0, if the initial `i+1` was odd, `b` is `a[i-1]`, `c` is equal to `a[i]`. If `i` is odd, then `b` is `a[0]` and `c` is `a[i-1]` if the new `i+1` is even, `b` is 0 and `c` is `a[i] + a[i-1]` if the new `i+1` is odd.***
