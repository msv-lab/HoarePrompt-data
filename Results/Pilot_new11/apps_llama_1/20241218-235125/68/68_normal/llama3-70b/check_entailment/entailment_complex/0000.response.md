Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description in all cases. 

The problem description states that the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations. 

However, the program prints '?' in cases where $x$ is greater than $y$ and $z$ is greater than 0, which is incorrect according to the problem description. 

In this case, if all $z$ persons upvote, the result will be '+' because $x + z > y$. If all $z$ persons downvote, the result will still be '+' because $x > y + z - z = y$. Therefore, the result is not uncertain in this case.

Another case where the program does not follow the problem description is when $x$ is equal to $y$ and $z$ is greater than 0. The program prints '?' in this case, which is correct, but it does not check if $z$ is even or odd. If $z$ is even, the result will still be '0' because $x + z/2 = y + z/2$. If $z$ is odd, the result will be uncertain because if the extra person upvotes, the result will be '+' and if the extra person downvotes, the result will be '-'.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and does not follow the problem description. 

The correct implementation should check for the following conditions:

- If $x > y + z$, the result is '+'.
- If $x < y$, the result is '-'.
- If $x == y$ and $z == 0$, the result is '0'.
- If $x > y$ and $z > 0$, the result is '+'.
- If $x < y + z$ and $x > y$, or if $x == y$ and $z > 0$, the result is '?'.
- If $x == y + z$, the result is '?'. 

This implementation would correctly follow the problem description and handle all cases. 

Here is a sample correct implementation in Python:
```python
x, y, z = map(int, input().split())

if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    if x + z < y:
        print('-')
    elif x > y:
        print('+')
    else:
        print('?')
```
This implementation correctly checks for all conditions and handles all cases according to the problem description.
