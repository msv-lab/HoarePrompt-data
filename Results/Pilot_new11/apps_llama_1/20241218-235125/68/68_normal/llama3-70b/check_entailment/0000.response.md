Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles all the possible cases as described in the problem statement. 

- If x is greater than y + z, it means that even if all unknown votes are downvotes, the upvotes will still be more, so the result is '+'. 
- If x is less than y, it means that even if all unknown votes are upvotes, the downvotes will still be more, so the result is '-'.
- If x is equal to y and z is 0, it means that there are no unknown votes, so the result is '0'. 
- If x is equal to y and z is not 0, it means that the unknown votes can change the result, so the result is uncertain and '?' is printed.
- In all other cases, the unknown votes can change the result, so the result is uncertain and '?' is printed.

The program handles all these cases correctly and does not have any missing logic or edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True. 

This function should cover all possible cases that are described in the problem, including the edge cases, so it can be considered correct. 

No counterexample was found, so the function should behave as expected according to the problem description. 

However, to cover more cases, we might want to add some more test cases or inputs to thoroughly verify its correctness, but with the current description and given examples, it works correctly.
