Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

In the problem description, it is stated that if there are more people who would upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people who would downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise, the result will be "0". Additionally, if the result is uncertain due to the unknown persons, the program should print "?".

However, in the given program, there are several issues:

1. If `x > y + z`, the program correctly prints "+". However, this condition only checks if the number of upvotes is more than the total number of downvotes and unknown votes. It does not consider the case where `x` is equal to `y + z` and the unknown persons could vote either way, making the result uncertain.

2. If `x < y`, the program correctly prints "-". However, this condition does not consider the case where `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 0. In this case, the result is uncertain because the unknown persons could vote either way.

3. If `x == y` and `z == 0`, the program correctly prints "0". However, if `x == y` and `z > 0`, the program prints "?", which is correct because the result is uncertain.

4. If `x > y` and `x <= y + z`, the program prints "?", which is incorrect. In this case, the result could be "+" or "0" depending on how the unknown persons vote. The program should print "?" only when the result is completely uncertain, i.e., when `x <= y + z` and `x >= y - z`.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to correctly handle all possible cases and print the result accordingly. 

Here is a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y - z:
        print('-')
    elif x >= y + z and x <= y - z:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
```
This implementation correctly checks all possible cases and prints the result or "?" accordingly.
