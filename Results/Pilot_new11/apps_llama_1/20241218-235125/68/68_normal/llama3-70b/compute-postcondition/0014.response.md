The given code snippet is `print('?')`, which simply prints a question mark to the console. This operation does not modify the values of `x`, `y`, or `z` in any way. 

The initial conditions specified that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100) with specific relationships between them: `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. Since the code does not alter these variables, these conditions remain unchanged.

Additionally, since `print('?')` does not return any value but simply prints to the console, there is no returned value to consider.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100), `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is not equal to `y`, and '?' has been printed to the console.**
