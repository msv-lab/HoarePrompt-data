The given code snippet is a simple print statement that prints '+'. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`. The values of these variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100), `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and '+' has been printed.**
