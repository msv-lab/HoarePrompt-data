Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers, `x` equals `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, if `z` is 0, then the state of `x`, `y`, and `z` remains as is. If `z` is greater than 0, then a '?' has been printed, and `x`, `y`, and `z` are still non-negative integers with `x` equal to `y` and `x` less than or equal to `y + z`.**
