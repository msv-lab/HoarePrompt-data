Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately handles all possible cases for determining the result of the votes.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- The program first calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes by adding the unknown votes (`z`) to the known upvotes (`x`) and downvotes (`y`), respectively.

- It then checks if the maximum possible upvotes (`x + z`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`y`). If this condition is true, it means that even if all unknown votes are upvotes, the total upvotes will still be less than the total downvotes, so the result will definitely be "-".

- Conversely, if the maximum possible downvotes (`y + z`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`x`), it means that even if all unknown votes are downvotes, the total downvotes will still be less than the total upvotes, so the result will definitely be "+".

- In all other cases, the maximum possible upvotes is greater than or equal to the minimum possible downvotes, and the maximum possible downvotes is greater than or equal to the minimum possible upvotes. This means that the result is uncertain because there are possible scenarios where the upvotes win, lose, or tie, depending on how the unknown votes are distributed, so the program prints "?".

This logic covers all possible cases and ensures that the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. The program does not have any obvious flaws or edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
