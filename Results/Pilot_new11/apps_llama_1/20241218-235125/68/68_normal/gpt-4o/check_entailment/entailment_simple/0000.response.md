Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the given values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. It first calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes: `min_upvotes = x` and `max_upvotes = x + z`. This is because the minimum number of upvotes is the number of people who would definitely upvote (`x`), and the maximum number of upvotes is the number of people who would definitely upvote plus the number of people who might upvote (`x + z`).

2. Similarly, it calculates the minimum and maximum possible downvotes: `min_downvotes = y` and `max_downvotes = y + z`. This is because the minimum number of downvotes is the number of people who would definitely downvote (`y`), and the maximum number of downvotes is the number of people who would definitely downvote plus the number of people who might downvote (`y + z`).

3. It then checks if the maximum possible upvotes is less than the minimum possible downvotes. If this is the case, it means that even if all the uncertain people upvoted, the total upvotes would still be less than the total downvotes, so the result is definitely "-".

4. If the maximum possible upvotes is not less than the minimum possible downvotes, it then checks if the maximum possible downvotes is less than the minimum possible upvotes. If this is the case, it means that even if all the uncertain people downvoted, the total downvotes would still be less than the total upvotes, so the result is definitely "+".

5. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that the result is uncertain, because the uncertain people could either upvote or downvote and change the outcome. In this case, the program prints "?".

The program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description. It does not assume any specific input or try to handle invalid input, as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
