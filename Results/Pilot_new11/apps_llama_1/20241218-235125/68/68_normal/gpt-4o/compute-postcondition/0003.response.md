The code assigns the value of `y` to `min_downvotes`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, and `max_upvotes` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
