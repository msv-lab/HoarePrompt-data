`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The initial state is that `x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`. The states of `x`, `y`, and `min_upvotes` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.
Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`**
