Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `avg` is `n // 4`, if the first character `c` of `s` is '?', then `c` is the first character from 'ACGT' that had a count greater than 0 in `count`, the count of the first character appended to `res` is decreased by 1 from its original value, and `res` contains the first character from 'ACGT' that had a count greater than 0 in `count`. Otherwise, `res` is a string containing the first character of `s` which is not '?', and `count` remains a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is `n // 4 - original_count[key]`.***
