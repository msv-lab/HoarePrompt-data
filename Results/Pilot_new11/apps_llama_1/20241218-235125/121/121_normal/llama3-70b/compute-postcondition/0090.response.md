Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is 0, `c` is the last character in `s`, and `res` contains the modified string from `s` with '?' replaced based on availability in `count` and 'ACGT'. None of the values in `count` are greater than 0, meaning all values in the dictionary are 0.**
