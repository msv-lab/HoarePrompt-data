Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character of `s`, if `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `res` is its original value plus 'A', `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where `count['A']` is `count['A']` - 1 and each other key's value is `n // 4 - original_count[key]`, `nc` is 'A', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
