Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character of `s`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where if `count['C']` was greater than 0, then `count['A']` is `count['A']` - 1, `count['C']` is `n // 4 - original_count['C'] - 1`, and each other key's value is `n // 4 - original_count[key]`, `nc` is 'C', if `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `res` is its original value plus 'A' and then 'C', else `res` is 'C' when `count['C']` is greater than 0, and no changes occur to `count` and `res` when `count['C']` is not greater than 0.**
