Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is the integer result of `n` divided by 4, `nc` is 'C'. If `count['C']` is greater than 0, then `res` is the previous value of `res` plus 'C', `count['C']` is the previous value of `count['C']` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count['C']` is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
