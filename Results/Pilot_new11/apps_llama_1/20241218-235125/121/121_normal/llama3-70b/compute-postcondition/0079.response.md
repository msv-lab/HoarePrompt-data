The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `nc`, which is 'G'. The initial value of `res` is not provided in the initial state, so we will express it as `res` plus 'G'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is the integer result of `n` divided by 4, `nc` is 'G', `res` is the initial value of `res` plus 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is the integer result of `n` divided by 4, `nc` is 'G', `res` is the initial value of `res` plus 'G'**
