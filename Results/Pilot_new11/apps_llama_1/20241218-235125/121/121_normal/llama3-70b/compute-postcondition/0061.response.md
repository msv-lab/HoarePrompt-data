Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character of `s`, `nc` is 'G'. If `count['G']` is greater than 0, then `count` is a dictionary where `count['G']` is `count['G'] - 1`, and if `count['C']` was originally greater than 0, then `count['A']` is `count['A']` - 1, `count['C']` is `n // 4 - original_count['C'] - 1`, and each other key's value is `n // 4 - original_count[key]`. If `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `res` is its original value plus 'A', 'C', and 'G', else if `count['C']` is greater than 0, `res` is 'CG'. If `count['G']` is not greater than 0, then `count` and `res` remain unchanged.**
