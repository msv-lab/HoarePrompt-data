Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is the integer result of `n` divided by 4, `nc` is 'G'. If `count['G']` is greater than 0, then `res` is the initial value of `res` plus 'G', and `count['G']` is decreased by 1 from its initial value.**
