The code `res += nc` is incrementing the value of `res` by the value of `nc`. The initial state of `nc` is 'C'. However, the initial state of `res` is not provided, so we will consider it as an unknown value. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an input integer, `s` is still an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is still the integer result of `n` divided by 4.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is the integer result of `n` divided by 4, `nc` is 'C', `res` is the previous value of `res` plus 'C'**
