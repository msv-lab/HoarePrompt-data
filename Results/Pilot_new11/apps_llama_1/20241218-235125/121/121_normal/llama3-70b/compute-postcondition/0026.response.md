Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `c` is '?', initially `nc` was 'A' and `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. The current value of `avg` is `n // 4`, `res` is an empty string. The current value of `nc` is 'A' and the count of 'A' in the dictionary is greater than 0, meaning the count of the current nucleotide (`nc`) is greater than 0.**
