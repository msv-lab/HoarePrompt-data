Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of decoding the genome by replacing unrecognized nucleotides with one of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') so that the number of nucleotides of each type becomes equal.

Here is why the code is correct:

1. It calculates the average count of each nucleotide type by integer dividing the length of the genome by 4.
2. It then determines how many of each nucleotide type are needed to reach this average count.
3. The code iterates through the genome, replacing each unrecognized nucleotide ('?') with a nucleotide type that has a count greater than 0.
4. If there are any nucleotide types left with a count greater than 0 after replacing all unrecognized nucleotides, the program prints '===' to indicate that it is impossible to decode the genome.

This solution works because it ensures that each nucleotide type is used as many times as necessary to reach the average count. If it is impossible to decode the genome (i.e., the total number of nucleotides is not a multiple of 4, or there are too many unrecognized nucleotides), the program correctly prints '==='.

I have not found any case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. The program handles all edge cases, including when the genome is already decoded, when there are no unrecognized nucleotides, and when it is impossible to decode the genome.
