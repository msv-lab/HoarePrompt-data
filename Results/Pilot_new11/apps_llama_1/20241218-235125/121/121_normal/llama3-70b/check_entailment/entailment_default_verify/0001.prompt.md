You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks if the input string can be decoded into a genome where the number of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides are equal. 

Here's how it works:

1. It first counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides in the input string.
2. It calculates the average number of each nucleotide that should be in the decoded genome by dividing the length of the string by 4.
3. For each nucleotide, it calculates the number of occurrences that still need to be added to reach the average by subtracting the current count from the average.
4. It then iterates over the input string. When it encounters a '?', it replaces it with the first nucleotide that still needs to be added to reach the average.
5. Finally, it checks if there are any nucleotides that still need to be added. If there are, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

The program handles the cases correctly as described in the problem description. It correctly determines whether the genome can be decoded and prints the decoded genome or '===' accordingly. 

The code works for all the provided test cases and seems to handle all the edge cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles the case when the input string is already decoded, when the input string cannot be decoded, and when the input string can be decoded in multiple ways.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes an integer `n` between 4 and 255, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' as input. It calculates the count of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` and then adjusts these counts to achieve a balanced distribution where each character's count is as close as possible to `n // 4`. If there are '?' characters in `s`, it replaces them with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' based on which character's count is currently below its target distribution. The function then checks if all '?' characters have been replaced such that the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are as close as possible to `n // 4`. If the counts are successfully balanced, the function prints the modified string `s` with all '?' replaced; otherwise, it prints '===' to indicate that not all '?' characters could be replaced to meet the target distribution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
