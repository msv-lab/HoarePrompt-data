Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks if the input string can be decoded into a genome where the number of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides are equal. 

Here's how it works:

1. It first counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides in the input string.
2. It calculates the average number of each nucleotide that should be in the decoded genome by dividing the length of the string by 4.
3. For each nucleotide, it calculates the number of occurrences that still need to be added to reach the average by subtracting the current count from the average.
4. It then iterates over the input string. When it encounters a '?', it replaces it with the first nucleotide that still needs to be added to reach the average.
5. Finally, it checks if there are any nucleotides that still need to be added. If there are, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

The program handles the cases correctly as described in the problem description. It correctly determines whether the genome can be decoded and prints the decoded genome or '===' accordingly. 

The code works for all the provided test cases and seems to handle all the edge cases correctly. For example, it correctly handles the case when the input string is already decoded, when the input string cannot be decoded, and when the input string can be decoded in multiple ways.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
