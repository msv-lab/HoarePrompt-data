Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` has at least one more key. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `result` is updated at index `i` with the value of `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop.***
