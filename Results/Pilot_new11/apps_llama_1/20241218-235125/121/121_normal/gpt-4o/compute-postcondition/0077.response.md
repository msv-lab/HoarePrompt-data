Postcondition: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is either the original count or the original count plus 1 if the corresponding character's count was less than `target_count`, `result` is a list where if `result[i]` is '?', its element is updated to a character from `s` that has a count less than `target_count`, otherwise it remains the same, `i` is the index of the last updated element in `result` plus 1, and `char` is the first key in the `counts` dictionary. The current value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`.**
