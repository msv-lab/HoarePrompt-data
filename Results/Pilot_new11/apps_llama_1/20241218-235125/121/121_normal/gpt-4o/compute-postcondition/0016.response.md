Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `char` is the second character in `s`. If the second `char` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', then `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where `counts[char]` is 2 and the counts for the other characters are 1, otherwise `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where `counts[char]` is 1 and the counts for the other characters are 0.**
