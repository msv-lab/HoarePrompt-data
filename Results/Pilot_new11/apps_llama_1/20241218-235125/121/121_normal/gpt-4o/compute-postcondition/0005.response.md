The given code prints '===' to the standard output stream. This operation does not modify the values of `n`, `s`, or `data`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional effect of printing '==='.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, `n` modulo 4 is not equal to 0, and '===' has been printed to the standard output stream.**
