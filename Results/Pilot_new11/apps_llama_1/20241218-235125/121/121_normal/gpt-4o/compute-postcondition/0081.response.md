Postcondition: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is either the original count or the original count plus 1 if the corresponding character's count was less than `target_count`. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1, `result` is a list where `result[i]` is `char`, `i` is the index of the last updated element in `result` plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counts[char]` is not less than `target_count`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
