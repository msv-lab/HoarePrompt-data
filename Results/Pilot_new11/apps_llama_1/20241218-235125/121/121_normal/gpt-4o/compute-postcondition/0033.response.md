Postcondition: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a string, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' containing the respective character counts in `s`. If `counts[char]` is greater than `target_count`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning anything, maintaining the existing state of `n`, `s`, `target_count`, and `counts`.**
