The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from the standard input stream, splits it into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. 

`n` is still an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255. `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and the number of each of the four nucleotide types plus the number of unrecognized nucleotides '?' is divisible by 4.

The value of `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', the number of each of the four nucleotide types plus the number of unrecognized nucleotides '?' is divisible by 4, and `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream.**
