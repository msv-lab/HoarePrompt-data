The value of `s` is updated to `data[1]`. The length of `s` is no longer necessarily equal to `n`, but `n` is still an integer equal to `int(data[0])`. The number of each of the four nucleotide types plus the number of unrecognized nucleotides '?' in the original `s` is divisible by 4, but this may not be true for the new `s`. The value of `data` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, and `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream**
