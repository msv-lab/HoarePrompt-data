Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to be correct based on the problem description and the output hints. It checks if the length of the genome is divisible by 4 and if the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' do not exceed the target count. If the length is not divisible by 4 or any of the counts exceed the target count, it prints '===' and returns. Otherwise, it replaces all occurrences of '?' in the string with the first available nucleotide type that has a count less than the target count, and then prints the modified string.

The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints. For example, it correctly handles cases where the input string contains only '?' characters and their count is evenly divisible by 4, replacing them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in that order, up to `n // 4` occurrences each.

The code also passes the test cases provided in the problem description:

* For the input `8` and `AG?C??CT`, it correctly replaces the '?' characters with 'A', 'G', 'T' to make the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' equal, resulting in the output `AGACGTCT`.
* For the input `4` and `AGCT`, it leaves the string unchanged since the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' are already equal, resulting in the output `AGCT`.
* For the input `6` and `????G?`, it prints '===' since it is impossible to make the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' equal.
* For the input `4` and `AA??`, it prints '===' since it is impossible to make the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' equal.

No cases were found where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description and the output hints.
