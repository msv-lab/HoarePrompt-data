Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. The program checks if the length `n` of the genome is divisible by 4. If it's not, the program prints '===' and returns, as required by the problem description.

2. It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the string `s`. If any of these counts exceed `n // 4`, the program prints '===' and returns, as required by the problem description.

3. If the counts are valid, the program replaces all occurrences of '?' in the string with the first available nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count less than `n // 4`. This ensures that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal, as required by the problem description.

4. Finally, the program prints the modified string, which is the decoded genome with all '?' replaced.

The program handles all potential cases specified in the problem description, including:

- If the input string contains only '?' characters, and their count is evenly divisible by 4, the function will replace them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in that order, up to `n // 4` occurrences each.

- If the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it, the function will print the original string.

- If it's impossible to decode the genome, the function will print '==='.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases as required.
