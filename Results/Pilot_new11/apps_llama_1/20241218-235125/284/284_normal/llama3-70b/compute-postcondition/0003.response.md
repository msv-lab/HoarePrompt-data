According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `num` is at least 4 (since the loop starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of `num`), the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` being an integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 1000 and `num` is greater than or equal to 2 does ensure that the loop can potentially execute, but it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num` is at least 4 for the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, `i` will start at 2.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 4 <= `num` <= 1000, `i` is 2**
