Correctness: **True**

The provided program is designed to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis that for each positive integer `m`, the number `n*m + 1` is a prime number, given a positive integer `n`. The code checks each value of `m` from 1 to 1000 and verifies if `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds an `m` where `n*m + 1` is not prime, it prints that `m` and stops.

The prime-checking function `func_1(num)` correctly identifies prime numbers by checking divisibility up to the square root of `num`, which is an efficient approach to reduce the number of checks.

Given the problem description, the program does the following correctly:
1. It takes an input `n` from the user.
2. It iterates through possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
3. For each `m`, it checks if `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function.
4. As soon as it finds an `m` where `n*m + 1` is not prime (i.e., `func_1(n*m + 1)` returns `False`), it prints that `m` and exits the loop.

The program handles all potential cases correctly based on the given problem description. It efficiently finds a counterexample for the hypothesis for any given `n` within the specified range of `m`. Since no case can be identified where the program fails to meet the requirements as described, the program is considered correct.
