Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads an input number `n` and checks for each `m` in the range `[1, 1000]` whether `n*m + 1` is a prime number. If it finds an `m` where `n*m + 1` is not prime, it prints that `m` and stops.

The function `func_1` checks if a given integer is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisors. This is an efficient way to check for primality and correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases.

The code handles the example test cases correctly. For `n = 3`, it outputs `1` because `3*1 + 1 = 4`, which is not prime. For `n = 4`, it outputs `2` because `4*2 + 1 = 9`, which is not prime.

Since the output hints agree with the code, and the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, we can conclude that the code is correct.
