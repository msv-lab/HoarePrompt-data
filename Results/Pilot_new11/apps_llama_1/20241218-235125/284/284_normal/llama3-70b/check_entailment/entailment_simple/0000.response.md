Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. The task is to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that there exists a positive integer `n` such that for each positive integer `m`, `n*m + 1` is a prime number. The program is designed to find an `m` for a given `n` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000. This is sufficient because the problem guarantees that a counterexample exists and will be found within this range.

2. For each `m`, the program checks if `n*m + 1` is a prime number by calling the `func_1` function. This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisors up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient and correct method.

3. If `n*m + 1` is not a prime number (i.e., `func_1` returns `False`), the program prints the current value of `m` and breaks out of the loop. This `m` is a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis, and the program has fulfilled its purpose.

4. The `func_1` function itself is also correct. It correctly handles the edge case where `num` is less than 2 (in which case it returns `False`, since numbers less than 2 are not prime). For numbers greater than or equal to 2, it checks for divisors up to the square root of `num`, which is sufficient to determine primality. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is prime.

Overall, the program is correct because it systematically searches for a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis and uses a correct method to check for primality. It will always find a counterexample for any given `n` within the guaranteed range of `m`.
