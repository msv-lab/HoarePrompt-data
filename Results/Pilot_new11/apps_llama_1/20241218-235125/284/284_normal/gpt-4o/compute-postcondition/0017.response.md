Postcondition: ***`x` is an odd integer not divisible by 3, larger than 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 121, `x` is not divisible by 5, `x` is not divisible by 7, and `i` is 11. If `x` is divisible by `i` (11) or `i + 2` (13), the program returns False; otherwise, there is no change in the state of `x` and `i`.***
