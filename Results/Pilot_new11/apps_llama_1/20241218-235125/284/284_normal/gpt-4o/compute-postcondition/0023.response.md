To determine the output state of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions and updates within the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
while i * i <= x:
    if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
        return False
    i += 6
```

And the initial state: `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 1000, and x is larger than 1, and x is larger than 3, and x is not divisible by 2 and x is not divisible by 3; `i` is 5.

From the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can observe the pattern:

- The loop starts with `i = 5` and increments `i` by 6 in each iteration. This means `i` takes values 5, 11, 17, 23, and so on.
- For each `i`, the loop checks if `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. If `x` is divisible by either, the function returns False, indicating `x` is not a prime number.
- The conditions for `x` not being divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, etc., suggest that `x` must be a prime number since it's not divisible by any of these primes.
- The loop continues as long as `i * i <= x`. This means the loop will check divisibility up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for primality tests.

Considering these points:

- If `x` is a prime number within the given range and conditions, the loop will execute until `i * i > x`.
- The final value of `i` will be the first value where `i * i > x`, given that `i` is incremented by 6 each time.
- If at any point `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the loop will terminate early with a return of False, indicating `x` is not prime.
- If the loop completes without returning False, `x` is likely a prime number, considering it has been checked against divisibility by all relevant primes up to its square root.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed would be:

Output State: **`i` is the smallest value greater than the square root of the original `x` such that `i` is of the form `5 + 6k` (where `k` is an integer), and if the function hasn't returned False, `x` is a prime number not divisible by 2, 3, or any prime number less than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
