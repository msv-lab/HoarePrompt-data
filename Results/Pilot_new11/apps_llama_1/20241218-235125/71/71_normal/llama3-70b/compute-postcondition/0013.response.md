The function `func` seems to be missing parameters. Based on the provided constraints, I will assume that the function should have two parameters, `n` and `k`.

The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer ranging from 0 to 2,000,000,000, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive. 

To determine the return value, we need the output description, which is currently missing. Once we have the output description, we can proceed to describe the functionality of the function.


Please provide the output description to proceed. 

Once we have it, the answer will be in the following format:
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, and returns [insert return value description].**
