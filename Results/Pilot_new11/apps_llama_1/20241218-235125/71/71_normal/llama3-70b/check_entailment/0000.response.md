Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue with the program is that it simply removes the last digit of the number until it is divisible by 10^k, which is not the optimal solution. 

For example, if the input is 10203049 2, the program will remove the last digit one by one until the number becomes 102030, which is divisible by 10^2. However, the optimal solution would be to remove the digits 1, 2, and 0, resulting in the number 3049, and then remove the digits 3, 4, and 9, resulting in the number 0, which is divisible by 10^2, or remove the digits 1, 0, 2, and 0, resulting in the number 3049, and then remove the digit 4 and 9 and one more digit to get a number divisible by 10^2, but the program does not consider these possibilities.

The program does not consider all possible ways to remove digits from the number to make it divisible by 10^k, it just removes the last digit until it is divisible by 10^k. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible subsequences of the input number and counting the minimum number of digits that need to be removed to make the subsequence divisible by 10^k. 

Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:
```python
import itertools

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    min_w = float('inf')
    for w in range(len(str(n)) + 1):
        for remove_indices in itertools.combinations(range(len(str(n))), w):
            new_n = ''.join([c for i, c in enumerate(str(n)) if i not in remove_indices])
            if new_n and new_n[0]!= '0' or new_n == '0':
                new_n_int = int(new_n)
                if new_n_int % (10 ** k) == 0:
                    min_w = min(min_w, w)
    print(min_w)
