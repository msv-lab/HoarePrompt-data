You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue with the program is that it simply removes the last digit of the number until it is divisible by 10^k, which is not the optimal solution. 

For example, if the input is 10203049 2, the program will remove the last digit one by one until the number becomes 102030, which is divisible by 10^2. However, the optimal solution would be to remove the digits 1, 2, and 0, resulting in the number 3049, and then remove the digits 3, 4, and 9, resulting in the number 0, which is divisible by 10^2, or remove the digits 1, 0, 2, and 0, resulting in the number 3049, and then remove the digit 4 and 9 and one more digit to get a number divisible by 10^2, but the program does not consider these possibilities.

The program does not consider all possible ways to remove digits from the number to make it divisible by 10^k, it just removes the last digit until it is divisible by 10^k. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible subsequences of the input number and counting the minimum number of digits that need to be removed to make the subsequence divisible by 10^k. 

Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:
```python
import itertools

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    min_w = float('inf')
    for w in range(len(str(n)) + 1):
        for remove_indices in itertools.combinations(range(len(str(n))), w):
            new_n = ''.join([c for i, c in enumerate(str(n)) if i not in remove_indices])
            if new_n and new_n[0]!= '0' or new_n == '0':
                new_n_int = int(new_n)
                if new_n_int % (10 ** k) == 0:
                    min_w = min(min_w, w)
    print(min_w)

func()
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer ranging from 0 to 2,000,000,000, and k is an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is either 0 or the original value of `n` with its last `k` digits removed if it was divisible by `10
    print(w)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer ranging from 0 to 2,000,000,000 and `k` is an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive. It returns the number of times `n` needs to be divided by 10 before its last `k` digits are removed, effectively counting the number of digits from the right that need to be removed to make `n` divisible by 10 to the power of `k`. If `n` is already divisible by 10 to the power of `k`, it returns 0. The function modifies the input variable `n` in the process and discards the modified value after execution. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has printed the count of divisions required to remove the last `k` digits of `n` and does not modify any external state beyond the print operation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
