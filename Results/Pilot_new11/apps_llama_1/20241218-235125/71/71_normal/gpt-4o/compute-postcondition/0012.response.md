Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer. If the last character of `n` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 0. If the last character of `n` is not '0', then `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 1. The function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count_zeros` equals `k`.***
