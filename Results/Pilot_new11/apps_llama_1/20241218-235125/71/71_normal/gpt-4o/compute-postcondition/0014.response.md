The value of `count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count_zeros` can be either 0 or 1, depending on whether the new last character of `n` is '0' or not. 

If the new last character of `n` is '0', then `count_zeros` is initially 1, so it becomes 2. 
If the new last character of `n` is not '0', then `count_zeros` is initially 0, so it becomes 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, `to_remove` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the new last character of `n` is '0' or not, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the new last character of `n` is '0' or not.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, if the new last character of `n` is '0', `count_zeros` is 2 and `to_remove` is 0, if not '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 1**
