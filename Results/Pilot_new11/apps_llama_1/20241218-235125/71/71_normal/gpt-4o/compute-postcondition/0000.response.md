The code assigns the input values to `n` and `k` after splitting the input string into two parts and converting them to strings. The previous values of `n` and `k` as an integer and a positive integer respectively are discarded. 

The value of `n` becomes a string and `k` becomes a string. The states of no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is a string**
