Postcondition: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` is an integer, if `count_zeros` equals `k`, then the loop or if statement is terminated; if `count_zeros` does not equal `k`, the conditions of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` remain unchanged, specifically: if the digit is '0', then `count_zeros` is 2 and `to_remove` is 0; if the digit is not '0', `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are determined by the second-to-last character of `n`: if it's '0', `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 1, otherwise `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 2.**
