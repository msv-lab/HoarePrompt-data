According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a string, but it needs to be a non-empty string for the loop to execute. The variable `digit` is introduced in the loop and is assigned the last character of `n` in the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0, `digit` is the last character of `n`**
