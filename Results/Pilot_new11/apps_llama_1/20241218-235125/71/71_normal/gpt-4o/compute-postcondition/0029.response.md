The code `print(len(n) - 1)` prints the length of the string `n` minus 1. The length of `n` is not specified, but it is known that `count_zeros` is less than `k`, indicating that the end of `n` was reached without finding `k` '0's.

The values of `n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove` are not changed by the code. The code only prints the length of `n` minus 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is less than `k`, `to_remove` is the count of non-'0' digits encountered before the loop terminated, and the length of `n` minus 1 has been printed, which is equal to `len(n) - 1`.**
