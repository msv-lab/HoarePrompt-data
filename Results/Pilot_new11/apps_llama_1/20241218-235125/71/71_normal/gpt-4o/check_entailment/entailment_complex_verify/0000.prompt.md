You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the number `n` has less than `k` digits and is not divisible by `10^k`. For example, when `n = 123` and `k = 3`, the program will output `len(n) - 1`, which is `2`, but the correct output should be `3` because we need to remove all digits to get a number divisible by `1000`.

Another issue is that the program does not consider cases where removing leading digits would result in a smaller number of removed digits. For example, when `n = 123000` and `k = 3`, the program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `3` because we can remove the leading `123` to get `000`, which is divisible by `1000`.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where `n` starts with zeros, although the problem statement guarantees that the input numbers are written in traditional notation of integers, without any extra leading zeros.

To solve this problem correctly, we need a more sophisticated algorithm that considers all possible substrings of `n` and checks if they are divisible by `10^k` after removing some digits. 

However, this solution should be revised to consider these cases and provide the correct output. 

Here is a simple step-by-step process to solve the problem:

1. Convert the input number `n` to a string to easily manipulate its digits.
2. Use a loop to generate all possible substrings of `n`.
3. For each substring, use another loop to generate all possible combinations of digits that can be removed from the substring.
4. Check if the resulting number after removing the digits is divisible by `10^k`. If it is, update the minimum number of digits to be removed.
5. Output the minimum number of digits to be removed.

The correct solution should use a more efficient algorithm to avoid unnecessary iterations and optimize the solution. 

The existing code has several logical and technical errors that make it incorrect. Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and k is a positive integer between 1 and 9, such that 0 <= n <= 2,000,000,000.
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either equal to `k` if `k` '0's were found from the end of `n`, or less than `k` if the end of `n` was reached without finding `k` '0's, and `to_remove` is the count of non-'0' digits encountered before the loop terminated.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either equal to `k` if `k` '0's were found from the end of `n`, or less than `k` if the end of `n` was reached without finding `k` '0's, and `to_remove` is the count of non-'0' digits encountered before the loop terminated. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then the value of `to_remove` has been printed. Otherwise, if `count_zeros` is less than `k`, the length of `n` minus 1, which is equal to `len(n) - 1`, has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a string representation of an integer and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9. It calculates the number of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until it encounters `k` zeros or reaches the beginning of `n`. If `k` zeros are found, it prints the count of non-zero digits encountered before the `k` zeros. If `k` zeros are not found, it prints the length of `n` minus 1. The function does not handle cases where `n` is an empty string, `k` is outside the specified range, or `n` contains non-digit characters. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that a value has been printed to the console, which is either the count of non-zero digits or the length of `n` minus 1, and the input parameters `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
