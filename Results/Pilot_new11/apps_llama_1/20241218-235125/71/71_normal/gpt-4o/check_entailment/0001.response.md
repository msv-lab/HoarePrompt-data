Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. 

One potential issue with this program is that it doesn't correctly handle cases where the number of zeros at the end of the number is less than k. In such cases, the program should try to remove as few digits as possible to get a number that is divisible by 10^k.

For example, consider the input "1234567 3". The program will output "6", but the correct answer is "6" because we need to remove at least 6 digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^3. However, the program doesn't consider the optimal removal of digits in such cases.

Another issue with the program is that it doesn't handle cases where the number starts with zeros correctly. Although the program doesn't need to handle such cases because the input is guaranteed to be without extra leading zeros, it's still worth noting that the program may not work correctly if the input can have leading zeros.

To correctly solve this problem, a more complex algorithm is needed that tries all possible removals of digits and checks if the resulting number is divisible by 10^k. The program should also correctly handle edge cases, such as when the number of zeros at the end of the number is less than k, or when the number starts with zeros (if such cases are allowed). 

Here is an example of how to solve this problem correctly in Python:
```python
def min_digits_to_remove(n, k):
    n = str(n)
    min_removals = len(n)
    for i in range(2**len(n)):
        bin_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(len(n))
        new_num = ''
        for j, digit in enumerate(n):
            if bin_str[j] == '1':
                new_num += digit
        if new_num and int(new_num) % (10**k) == 0:
            min_removals = min(min_removals, len(n) - len(new_num))
    return min_removals

n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(min_digits_to_remove(n, k))
```
