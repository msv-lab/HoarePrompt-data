You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and k is a positive integer between 1 and 9, such that 0 <= n <= 2,000,000,000.
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either equal to `k` if `k` '0's were found from the end of `n`, or less than `k` if the end of `n` was reached without finding `k` '0's, and `to_remove` is the count of non-'0' digits encountered before the loop terminated.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either equal to `k` if `k` '0's were found from the end of `n`, or less than `k` if the end of `n` was reached without finding `k` '0's, and `to_remove` is the count of non-'0' digits encountered before the loop terminated. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then the value of `to_remove` has been printed. Otherwise, if `count_zeros` is less than `k`, the length of `n` minus 1, which is equal to `len(n) - 1`, has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a string representation of an integer and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9. It calculates the number of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until it encounters `k` zeros or reaches the beginning of `n`. If `k` zeros are found, it prints the count of non-zero digits encountered before the `k` zeros. If `k` zeros are not found, it prints the length of `n` minus 1. The function does not handle cases where `n` is an empty string, `k` is outside the specified range, or `n` contains non-digit characters. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that a value has been printed to the console, which is either the count of non-zero digits or the length of `n` minus 1, and the input parameters `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
