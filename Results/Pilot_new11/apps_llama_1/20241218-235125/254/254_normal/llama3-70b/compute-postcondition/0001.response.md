The given code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, respectively. This is a step typically found in the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Given the initial state: `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 1500, and considering the code `a, b = b, a % b`, we can deduce the following:

- The value of `c` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation.
- The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b`, which is `a % b`.

Therefore, after executing the given code, the output state is: `c` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `c` <= 1500, `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, which means `b` is equal to `a % b` (using the original values of `a` and `b`).

Output State: **`c` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `c` <= 1500, `a` is equal to the original `b`, `b` is equal to the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.**
