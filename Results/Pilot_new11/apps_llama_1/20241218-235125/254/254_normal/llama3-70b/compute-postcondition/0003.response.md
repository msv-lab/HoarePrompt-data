The given code snippet is `a, b = b, a % b`. This line of code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b` for the next iteration. 

Given the initial state:
- `c` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `c` <= 1500. 
- `a` is equal to the original `b`, implying that initially, `a` equals `b`.
- `b` must be non-zero.

The impact of the code:
- The new value of `a` becomes the original value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, which is `a % b`. Since initially `a` equals `b`, `a % b` equals `b % b` which is 0.

However, considering the context of the problem and the operation performed, it seems the intention might be to discuss the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. But given `a` equals `b` initially, this specific step would result in `b` becoming 0, which does not align with the typical use of the Euclidean algorithm where `b` should be non-zero for the division to make sense.

Thus, after executing `a, b = b, a % b`:
- `c` remains unchanged as it's not involved in the operation.
- The original relationship between `a` and `b` (where `a` equals the original `b`) no longer holds because `a` now equals the original `b`, and `b` equals 0 (since `a % b` where `a` equals `b` results in 0).

Given this, the output state, taking into account the specific initial conditions and the operation performed, should reflect that `a` now holds the original value of `b`, and `b` is 0. However, considering the constraint that `b` must be non-zero, this creates an inconsistency because after the operation, `b` would indeed be 0.

Therefore, considering the specific initial condition and the operation:
Output State: **`c` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `c` <= 1500, `a` equals the original value of `b`, and `b` is 0, but this conflicts with the requirement that `b` must be non-zero.**
