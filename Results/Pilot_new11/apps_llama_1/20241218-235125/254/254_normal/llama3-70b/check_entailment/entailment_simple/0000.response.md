Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described. The issue lies in the way it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garland intervals (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`) and checks if it is divisible by each of the intervals.

The problem requires finding if there exist three integers (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`) representing the seconds when each garland is switched on, such that every second after the maximum of these three seconds has at least one garland lit. This essentially means that for any second `t` greater than or equal to `max(x1, x2, x3)`, at least one of the garlands should be in a lit state.

The provided program attempts to solve this by calculating the LCM of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, and then checking if this LCM is divisible by each of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. However, this approach does not directly address the requirement that every second after the maximum start time should have at least one garland lit.

The calculation of the LCM is also incorrect. The formula used (`lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))`) is not a standard or correct method to calculate the LCM of three numbers, especially considering the function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two numbers, not directly contributing to finding a valid set of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` for the problem's conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to consider the possible combinations of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` that satisfy the condition that every second after `max(x1, x2, x3)` has at least one lit garland, taking into account the intervals at which each garland lights up.

A correct approach would involve checking for any possibility where the lighting patterns of the garlands could leave a second unlit after `max(x1, x2, x3)`, considering all possible start times and the intervals at which each garland is lit. This is not addressed by the provided program.
