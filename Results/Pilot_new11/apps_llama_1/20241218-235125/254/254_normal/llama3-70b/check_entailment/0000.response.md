Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is with the way it calculates the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the three garland intervals and uses it to determine if it's possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit every second.

The problem in the code is that it only checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals, which is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second.

For example, if the input is 2, 4, 3, the program will calculate the LCM as 12 and then check if 12 is divisible by 2, 4, and 3. Although 12 is divisible by all three, the program will still print 'NO' because of the way it checks the divisibility.

However, a correct approach would be to check all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verify if there is at least one second in which no garland is lit.

A counterexample to the given program is the input 2, 2, 3. The program will print 'YES', which is correct. However, if we modify the code to calculate the LCM correctly and check the divisibility, we can find a case where the program fails.

Let's consider the input 3, 4, 5. The LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60. The program will calculate the LCM correctly but will print 'NO' because it does not correctly check if it's possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit every second.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to check all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verify if there is at least one second in which no garland is lit. 

Here's an example of a correct Python program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def solve():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    for x1 in range(k1):
        for x2 in range(k2):
            for x3 in range(k3):
                possible = True
                max_time = max(x1, x2, x3)
                for time in range(max_time, max_time + k1 * k2 * k3):
                    if (time - x1) % k1!= 0 and (time - x2) % k2!= 0 and (time - x3) % k3!= 0:
                        possible = False
                        break
                if possible:
                    print('YES')
                    return
    print('NO')

solve()
