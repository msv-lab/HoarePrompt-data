Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem asks whether it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. However, the program only checks if the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garlands is divisible by each of the individual garland periods. This is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that every second will be covered by at least one lit garland.

A counterexample is when the input is 2, 4, and 3. The LCM of 2, 4, and 3 is 12, which is divisible by 2, 4, and 3. However, if we switch on the garlands at the same time, there will be seconds when no garland is lit. For example, after 12 seconds, the garlands will be lit at seconds 13, 14, and 15 for the periods 2, 4, and 3 respectively, but there is a gap at second 12 + 1 = 13 - 2 = 11, 11 + 4 = 15, and 13 - 3 = 10,  12 + 1 = 13 where no garland is lit.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the actual periods of the garlands and check if there are any gaps in the seconds covered by the lit garlands. The provided program does not perform this check, therefore, it does not work correctly for every potential case. 

Also note that, the program does not calculate LCM correctly, since it is using a function `func_1` which calculates GCD but the formula to calculate LCM is `lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a,b)`. But even if LCM was calculated correctly, the logic of the program would still be incorrect.
