Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. It calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the three input numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` using the formula `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (gcd(k1, k2) * gcd(k2, k3) * gcd(k1, k3))`, where `gcd` is the Greatest Common Divisor function. However, it then checks if `lcm` is a multiple of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, which is not the correct condition to check.

The problem description states that Mishka wants to choose three integers `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` such that he will switch on the first garland during `x1`-th second, the second one during `x2`-th second, and the third one during `x3`-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from `max(x1, x2, x3)` at least one garland will be lit.

The program should instead check if there exist three integers `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` such that for every second `s` greater than or equal to `max(x1, x2, x3)`, at least one of the following conditions is true: `(s - x1) % k1 == 0`, `(s - x2) % k2 == 0`, or `(s - x3) % k3 == 0`. This means that at least one of the garlands will be lit during each second `s`.

The program does not correctly implement this check, and therefore does not always do what the problem description says. For example, if the input is `2 3 4`, the program will calculate `lcm = 12` and check if `12` is a multiple of `2`, `3`, and `4`, which it is. However, this does not guarantee that there exist three integers `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` such that at least one garland will be lit during each second `s` greater than or equal to `max(x1, x2, x3)`.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` and verifying that for every second `s` greater than or equal to `max(x1, x2, x3)`, at least one garland will be lit. This can be done using a brute-force approach or a more efficient algorithm. However, the provided program does not implement this check correctly, and therefore is not correct.
