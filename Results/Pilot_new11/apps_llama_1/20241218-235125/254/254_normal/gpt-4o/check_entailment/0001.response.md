Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is equal to 1. However, this is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland in every second after switching them on.

A counterexample is when `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 4`, and `k3 = 6`. In this case, the GCD of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 2, so the program would print 'NO'. However, if we switch on the garlands at seconds 1, 2, and 3, respectively, we get the following lit seconds:
- Garland 1: 1, 3, 5, 7,...
- Garland 2: 2, 6, 10, 14,...
- Garland 3: 3, 9, 15, 21,...

As we can see, every second after switching on the garlands is covered by at least one lit garland. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if there exists a sequence of switching times for the garlands such that every second after switching them on is covered by at least one lit garland. This requires a more complex algorithm than simply checking the GCD of the time intervals.
