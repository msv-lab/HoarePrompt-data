The code snippet assigns the values of the `(j + 1)`-th tuple in `sofas` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The previous values of these variables are overwritten. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `j` is either 1 or not equal to `i`, and if `i` equals `j`, then `j` is 1. 

The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` (the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`) remain unchanged.

Since `d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, and `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, the `(j + 1)`-th tuple exists in `sofas`. 

The output state is: `d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 1 or `i` and `j` are not equal, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `(j + 1)`-th tuple of `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 1 or `i` and `j` are not equal, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `(j + 1)`-th tuple of `sofas`.**
