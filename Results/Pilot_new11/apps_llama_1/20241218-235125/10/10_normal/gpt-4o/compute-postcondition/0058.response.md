Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the 3rd tuple of `sofas`. If `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j`, then `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `left_count[i]` is the original value of `left_count[i]` plus 1, otherwise `left_count` remains unchanged. If `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `top_count[i]` is the input integer plus 1, otherwise `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers. If `y1` < `y1_j` and `y2` < `y1_j`, then `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `bottom_count[i]` is the original value of `bottom_count[i]` plus 1. If `x1` < `x1_j` and `x2` < `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is the original value of `right_count[i]` plus 1, otherwise the state of `right_count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers***
