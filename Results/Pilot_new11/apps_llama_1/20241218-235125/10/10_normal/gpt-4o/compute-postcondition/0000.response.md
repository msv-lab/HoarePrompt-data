The code `d = int(input().strip())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `d`. This directly influences the value of `d`, making it equal to the input integer. The initial state mentions that `d` is between 1 and 10^5, which is still valid as the input is expected to be an integer within this range.

The states of the other mentioned variables and input lines (`n`, `m`, coordinates, counts) are not directly affected by this line of code, as they are defined by subsequent inputs or operations not shown in this snippet. Therefore, their initial conditions remain unchanged.

Given that `d` is now an integer input value, the output state reflects this update while keeping all other initial conditions valid.

Output State: **`d` is an integer input value between 1 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are between 1 and 10^5, coordinates are between 1 and `n` or `m`, and counts are between 0 and `d`-1.**
