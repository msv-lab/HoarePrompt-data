To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The initial state specifies:
- `d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `n` and `m` are input integer values.
- `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers.
- `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers.
- `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers.
- `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers.
- `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers.
- `i` and `j` are either both 0 or `i` and `j` are not equal, and we stay in the current iteration of the loop.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]
```

This line of code assigns the values from the tuple at index `j` in the `sofas` list to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, respectively.

Since `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` were specified as the values in the first tuple of `sofas` (implying they are at index 0), and given the assignment, we now have:
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the values from the `j`-th tuple in `sofas`.

All other variables retain their initial state specifications because the code snippet only affects the assignment of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 0 or `i` and `j` are not equal and we stay in the current iteration of the loop, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `j`-th tuple of `sofas`.**
