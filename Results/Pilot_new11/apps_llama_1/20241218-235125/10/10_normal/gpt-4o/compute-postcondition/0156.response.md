Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` integers. If at index `i`, `left_count[i]` equals `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` equals `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` equals `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cnt_b`, then `target_sofa` is 1 and the loop breaks, otherwise `target_sofa` remains -1.***
