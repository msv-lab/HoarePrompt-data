Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[2]` is the original value of `left_count[2]` plus 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `right_count[2]` is the original value of `right_count[2]` plus 1. Additionally, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[2]` is the original value of `bottom_count[2]` plus 1, and `y1` and `y2` are less than `y1_j`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
