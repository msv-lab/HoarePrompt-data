To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop statement and the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(d):
    # the loop body is omit
```
And the state at the end of the previous iteration:
* `d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5
* `n` and `m` are input integer values
* `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers
* `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers
* `left_count` is a list of `d` integers
* `right_count` is a list of `d` integers
* `top_count` is a list of `d` integers
* `bottom_count` is a list of `d` integers
* `i` is the index of the next sofa

Since the loop iterates over the range of `d`, the next iteration will execute if `i` is less than `d`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current index. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of `d` integers, `i` is the index of the next sofa incremented by 1**
