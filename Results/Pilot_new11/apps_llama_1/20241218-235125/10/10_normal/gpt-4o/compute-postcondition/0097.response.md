The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right_count[i]` is not specified, but it is now increased by 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected: `d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the `(j+1)-th` tuple elements in `sofas`, `j` is equal to the last iteration number plus one. 

Also, if `i` equals `j`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the loop ends.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the `(j+1)-th` tuple elements in `sofas`, `j` is equal to the last iteration number plus one, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the loop ends**
