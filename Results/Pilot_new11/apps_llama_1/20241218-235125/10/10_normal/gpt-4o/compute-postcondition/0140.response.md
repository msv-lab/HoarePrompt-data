The given code snippet assigns the values from the `(j+1)-th` tuple in the `sofas` list to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. 

The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are updated to the corresponding values in the `(j+1)-th` tuple of `sofas`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is the next index plus one, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the four input integers corresponding to the `(j+1)-th` tuple in `sofas`.**
