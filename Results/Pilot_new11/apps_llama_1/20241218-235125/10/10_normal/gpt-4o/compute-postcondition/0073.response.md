The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left_count[i]` was the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, 
`n` and `m` are input integer values, 
`sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, 
`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, 
`left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where the element at index `i` is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions plus 1 and the other elements remain unchanged, 
`top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers where each element is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions, 
if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where the element at index `i` is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions plus 1, otherwise `right_count` remains unchanged, 
`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the second tuple of `sofas`, 
`x1_j` is `x1`, 
`y1_j` is `y1`, 
`x2_j` is `x2`, 
`y2_j` is `y2`, 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 0, 
`x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`.
