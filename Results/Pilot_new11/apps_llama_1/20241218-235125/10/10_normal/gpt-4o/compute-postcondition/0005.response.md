The code appends a tuple containing the input integers `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` to the list `sofas`. The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, and `counts` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, `counts` are between 0 and `d`-1, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
