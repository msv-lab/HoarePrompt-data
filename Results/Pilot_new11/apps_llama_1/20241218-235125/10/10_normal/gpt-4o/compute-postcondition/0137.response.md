To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the given information and the loop condition. 

Given the loop statement `for j in range(d):`, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `d`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has a certain value, and `d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` is the index of the `sofas` list, which contains at least `d` tuples, the list must still have at least `d` tuples when `j` is incremented.

Considering the conditions for `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count`, these lists will be updated accordingly based on the comparison of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `x2_j`, `y1_j`, and `y2_j`. However, these updates do not affect the loop condition, which only depends on `j` and `d`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has a certain value. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `d`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `j` will now be `j + 1`. The loop will execute again if `j + 1` is less than `d`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `d` remains the same, as it is not changed by the loop iteration.
- Other variables (`n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, `bottom_count`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`) may be updated based on the loop body, but these updates do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is the next index plus one, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are input integers corresponding to the `(j+1)-th` tuple in `sofas`, and if `i` equals `j+1`, the loop skips to the next iteration, `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are updated according to the loop body**
