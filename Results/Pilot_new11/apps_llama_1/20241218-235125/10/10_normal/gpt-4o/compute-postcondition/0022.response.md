The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. In this case, since `i` is equal to `j` and both are 0, and there are no changes to the variables, the values of the variables remain the same. 

The value of `i` is still 0 and `j` is still 0. `d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5. `n` and `m` are input integer values. `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers. `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers. `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `j`, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas` and we move to the next iteration of the loop**
