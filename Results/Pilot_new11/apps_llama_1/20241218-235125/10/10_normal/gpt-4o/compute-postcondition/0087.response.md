The code increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. The previous value of `left_count[i]` is unknown, but it is an element of the list `left_count`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the `j-th` tuple elements in `sofas`, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the `j-th` tuple elements in `sofas`, `left_count[i]` is the old value of `left_count[i]` plus 1**
