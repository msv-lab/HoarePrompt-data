The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the given initial state, there is no explicit loop mentioned. But assuming that this code is part of a loop (since `continue` can only be used within a loop), the `continue` statement will cause the loop to move on to the next iteration.

Given that, the values of the variables do not change because of the `continue` statement itself. The `continue` statement does not modify any variables; it only affects the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, if `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `top_count[i]` is the input integer plus 1, otherwise `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 2 or `i` and `j` are not equal, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `(j + 1)`-th tuple of `sofas`, `j` is 2, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
