The loop code is designed to append input coordinates to the `sofas` list `d` times. 

After analyzing the loop code and the provided output states, it's clear that the loop will execute `d` times, and in each iteration, it will append a tuple of four input integers to the `sofas` list.

If `d` is 0, the loop won't execute, and the `sofas` list will remain empty.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 0 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
