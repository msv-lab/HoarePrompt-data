Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, if `i` equals `j`, then the lists `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` are updated according to the given conditions based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
