The function accepts a sofa and a list of sofas as input, where each sofa is represented by a list of four integers. It returns the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa within the list of sofas. The function considers a sofa to be to the left, right, top, or bottom of the given sofa if they share the same y or x coordinate and the given sofa's x or y coordinate is greater than or less than the other sofa's corresponding coordinate. The function returns four non-negative integers representing the count of sofas in each direction. If the input sofa does not exist in the list of sofas or there are no other sofas, the function returns (0, 0, 0, 0). The function handles cases where the input sofa is at an edge or corner of the set of sofas, and correctly counts the number of sofas in each direction. However, the function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input will be a list of four integers and a list of such lists. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where two or more sofas have the same coordinates, as this is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations or the code.
