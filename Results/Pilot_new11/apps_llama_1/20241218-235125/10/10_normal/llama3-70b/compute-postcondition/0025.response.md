Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sofas, `s` is the second sofa in the `sofas` list. If `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then the values of `top`, `right`, `left`, and `bottom` are updated based on the comparisons of the first and second elements of the first sublists in `sofa` and `s`: `top` is increased by 1 if the first element of `sofa` is equal to the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is less than the second element of `s`; `right` is increased by 1 if the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`; `left` is increased by 1 if the first element of `sofa` is less than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`; `bottom` is increased by 1 if the first element of `sofa` is equal to the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` is greater than the second element of `s`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.**
