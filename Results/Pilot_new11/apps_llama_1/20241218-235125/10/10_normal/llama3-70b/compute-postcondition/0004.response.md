The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was 0, so the new value of `left` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list, the current value of `s` is not equal to `sofa`, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. Additionally, the first element of the first sublist of `sofa` is less than the first element of the first sublist of `s`, and the second element of the first sublist of `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first sublist of `s`.
Output State: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list, `s` is not equal to `sofa`, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, the first element of the first sublist of `sofa` is less than the first element of the first sublist of `s`, and the second element of the first sublist of `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first sublist of `s`.**
