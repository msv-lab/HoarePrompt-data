Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list, `s` is not equal to `sofa`. The second element of `sofa` is greater than the second element of `s` and the first element of `sofa` is equal to the first element of `s`. If the first element of `sofa` was greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` was equal to the second element of `s`, then the current value of `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `top` is 0 if `sofa[0][1]` is not less than `s[0][1]`, otherwise `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 0. If the first element of `sofa` was less than the first element of `s` and the second element of `sofa` was equal to the second element of `s`, then the current value of `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0 if `sofa[0][1]` is not less than `s[0][1]`, otherwise `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 0. In all other previous cases, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` remained unchanged, all equal to 0 if `sofa[0][1]` is not less than `s[0][1]`, otherwise `top` is 1. However, given the current if condition, the current value of `left` is 0, `right` is 1 is not valid and the current value of `left` is 1, `right` is 0 is not valid. The current values of `left` and `right` must be derived from the previous conditions. The current value of `top` is 0 because `sofa[0][1]` is greater than `s[0][1]` and `bottom` is 0.**
