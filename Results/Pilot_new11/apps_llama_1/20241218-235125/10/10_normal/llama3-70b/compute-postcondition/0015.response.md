Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sofa, `s` is the first sofa in the `sofas` list, if `s` is not equal to `sofa`, then the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are determined by the comparisons between the elements of `sofa` and `s`: if the first element of `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second elements are equal, then `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `top` is 0 if `sofa[0][1]` is not less than `s[0][1]`, otherwise `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 0; if the first element of `sofa` is less than the first element of `s` and the second elements are equal, then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0 if `sofa[0][1]` is not less than `s[0][1]`, otherwise `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 0; if the second element of `sofa` is greater than the second element of `s` and the first elements are equal, then `left` and `right` retain their previous values, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 1; in all other cases under the condition `s` is not equal to `sofa`, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged, with `left`, `right`, and `bottom` equal to 0 and `top` equal to 0 if `sofa[0][1]` is not less than `s[0][1]`, otherwise `top` is 1; if `s` equals `sofa`, then `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged as 0.**
