#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a list of four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa, and sofas is a list of lists, where each sublist contains four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa in the storehouse.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of sofas, `left` is the number of sofas to the left of `sofa`, `right` is the number of sofas to the right of `sofa`, `top` is the number of sofas above `sofa`, and `bottom` is the number of sofas below `sofa`, with `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` being 0 if the loop does not execute.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of `sofa`, with each being 0 or more, depending on the position of `sofa` within the list of sofas `sofas`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sofa and a list of sofas as input, where each sofa is represented by a list of four integers. It returns the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa within the list of sofas. The function considers a sofa to be to the left, right, top, or bottom of the given sofa if they share the same y or x coordinate and the given sofa's x or y coordinate is greater than or less than the other sofa's corresponding coordinate. The function returns four non-negative integers representing the count of sofas in each direction. If the input sofa does not exist in the list of sofas or there are no other sofas, the function returns (0, 0, 0, 0). The function handles cases where the input sofa is at an edge or corner of the set of sofas, and correctly counts the number of sofas in each direction. However, the function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input will be a list of four integers and a list of such lists. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where two or more sofas have the same coordinates, as this is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations or the code.
