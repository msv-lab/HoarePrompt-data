Correctness: **False**.

The code seems to be incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. The function `func_1` only compares the coordinates of the first point of each sofa, which is not enough to determine the relative position of two sofas. 

For example, consider two sofas `s1` and `s2` with coordinates `((1, 1), (1, 2))` and `((1, 2), (1, 3))`, respectively. In this case, `s1` is to the top of `s2`, but the function `func_1` would not count it as such because it only compares the y-coordinates of the first points of the sofas, which are the same.

To correctly count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa, the code should compare the x and y coordinates of both points of each sofa. 

Additionally, the function `func_1` should be modified to handle cases where two sofas have the same x or y coordinate, but one sofa is still to the left, right, top, or bottom of the other. 

The correct implementation should iterate over all cells covered by the given sofa and compare them with all cells covered by other sofas. This is because a sofa can be to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa if there exist two cells, one covered by each sofa, such that the x or y coordinate of the cell covered by the first sofa is less than or greater than the x or y coordinate of the cell covered by the second sofa.

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    cells_covered_by_sofa = set()
    for x in [sofa[0][0], sofa[1][0]]:
        for y in [sofa[0][1], sofa[1][1]]:
            cells_covered_by_sofa.add((x, y))
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            cells_covered_by_other_sofa = set()
            for x in [s[0][0], s[1][0]]:
                for y in [s[0][1], s[1][1]]:
                    cells_covered_by_other_sofa.add((x, y))
            for cell in cells_covered_by_sofa:
                for other_cell in cells_covered_by_other_sofa:
                    if cell[0] < other_cell[0]:
                        left += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[0] > other_cell[0]:
                        right += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] < other_cell[1]:
                        top += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] > other_cell[1]:
                        bottom += 1
                        break
            else:
                continue
            break
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```
Note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(d^2 * 4^2) where d is the number of sofas, which may not be efficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution would require a more complex data structure, such as a quadtree or a k-d tree, to store the cells covered by each sofa.
