You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for every potential case because the `func_1` function only considers the position of the first cell of each sofa when comparing them, but the problem description states that a sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_a < x_b, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. This means that the function should consider both cells of each sofa, not just the first one.

For example, if we have two sofas with coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2) and (2, 1), (3, 1) respectively, the function will incorrectly determine that the first sofa is to the left of the second sofa, because it only compares the x-coordinates of the first cells of the two sofas, which are both 1.

To fix this, the function should be modified to consider both cells of each sofa when comparing them. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
            other_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            for cell in cells:
                for other_cell in other_cells:
                    if cell[0] < other_cell[0]:
                        left += 1
                    elif cell[0] > other_cell[0]:
                        right += 1
                    if cell[1] < other_cell[1]:
                        top += 1
                    elif cell[1] > other_cell[1]:
                        bottom += 1
    # Avoid counting duplicates
    left = (left > 0)
    right = (right > 0)
    top = (top > 0)
    bottom = (bottom > 0)
    # Count the actual sofas
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
            other_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            left_sofa = False
            right_sofa = False
            top_sofa = False
            bottom_sofa = False
            for cell in cells:
                for other_cell in other_cells:
                    if cell[0] < other_cell[0]:
                        left_sofa = True
                    elif cell[0] > other_cell[0]:
                        right_sofa = True
                    if cell[1] < other_cell[1]:
                        top_sofa = True
                    elif cell[1] > other_cell[1]:
                        bottom_sofa = True
            if left_sofa:
                left += 1
            if right_sofa:
                right += 1
            if top_sofa:
                top += 1
            if bottom_sofa:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

However, this function still does not perfectly solve the problem, as it counts the same sofa multiple times if they are on the same row or column. A better approach would be to directly compare the sofas based on the conditions given in the problem description. 

One possible solution would be to create sets of sofas that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of the current sofa, and then count the number of sofas in each set. This approach would ensure that each sofa is only counted once. 

Here is a simplified and corrected version of the program:

```python
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left = sum(1 for s in sofas if s!= sofa and (sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] or sofa[0][0] < s[1][0]) and (sofa[1][0] < s[0][0] or sofa[1][0] < s[1][0]))
    right = sum(1 for s in sofas if s!= sofa and (sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] or sofa[0][0] > s[1][0]) and (sofa[1][0] > s[0][0] or sofa[1][0] > s[1][0]))
    top = sum(1 for s in sofas if s!= sofa and (sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] or sofa[0][1] < s[1][1]) and (sofa[1][1] < s[0][1] or sofa[1][1] < s[1][1]))
    bottom = sum(1 for s in sofas if s!= sofa and (sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] or sofa[0][1] > s[1][1]) and (sofa[1][1] > s[0][1] or sofa[1][1] > s[1][1]))
    return (left, right, top, bottom)

for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a list of four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa, and sofas is a list of lists, where each sublist contains four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa in the storehouse.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists of sofas, `left` is the number of sofas to the left of `sofa`, `right` is the number of sofas to the right of `sofa`, `top` is the number of sofas above `sofa`, and `bottom` is the number of sofas below `sofa`, with `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` being 0 if the loop does not execute.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of `sofa`, with each being 0 or more, depending on the position of `sofa` within the list of sofas `sofas`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sofa and a list of sofas as input, where each sofa is represented by a list of four integers. It returns the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa within the list of sofas. The function considers a sofa to be to the left, right, top, or bottom of the given sofa if they share the same y or x coordinate and the given sofa's x or y coordinate is greater than or less than the other sofa's corresponding coordinate. The function returns four non-negative integers representing the count of sofas in each direction. If the input sofa does not exist in the list of sofas or there are no other sofas, the function returns (0, 0, 0, 0). The function handles cases where the input sofa is at an edge or corner of the set of sofas, and correctly counts the number of sofas in each direction. However, the function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input will be a list of four integers and a list of such lists. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where two or more sofas have the same coordinates, as this is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations or the code.
