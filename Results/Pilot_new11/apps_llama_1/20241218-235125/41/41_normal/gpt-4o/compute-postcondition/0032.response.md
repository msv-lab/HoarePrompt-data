The code sets `is_unrated` to `True`. The initial value of `is_unrated` is already `True`, so this assignment does not change its value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 3, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`**
