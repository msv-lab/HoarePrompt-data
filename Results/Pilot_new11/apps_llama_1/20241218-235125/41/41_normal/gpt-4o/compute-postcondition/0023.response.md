Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, initially `is_rated` was `False`, and `is_unrated` was `False`, `i` is 1. The current value of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remains `False`. The first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`.**
