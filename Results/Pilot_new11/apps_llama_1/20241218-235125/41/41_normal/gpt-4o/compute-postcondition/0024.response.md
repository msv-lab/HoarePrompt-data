The code sets `is_unrated` to `True`. The previous values of the other variables are still valid. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive. The value of `ratings` is still a list of `n` tuples of integers. The value of `is_rated` is still `False`. The value of `i` is still 1. The first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is still less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 1, and the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`.**
