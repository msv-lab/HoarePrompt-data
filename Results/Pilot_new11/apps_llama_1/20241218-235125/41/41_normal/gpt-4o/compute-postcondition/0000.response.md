The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The precondition states that the input consists of a single integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000). Therefore, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, representing the number of participants**
