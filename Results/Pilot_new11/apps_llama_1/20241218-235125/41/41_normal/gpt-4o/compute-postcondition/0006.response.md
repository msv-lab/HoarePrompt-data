The code `ratings.append((a, b))` adds a tuple containing the values of `a` and `b` to the end of the `ratings` list. 

The value of `n` is between 2 and 1000, inclusive, and it is not affected by the code. 
The values of `a` and `b` are input integers and they are also not affected by the code. 
The values of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` are `False` and they are not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list containing a tuple of two input integers, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list containing [(`a`, `b`)], `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
