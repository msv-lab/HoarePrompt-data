Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list containing at least one element which is a tuple of two integers (`a`, `b`), `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True` and `is_unrated` is `False`. If `a` equals `b`, then the state of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` remains unchanged as `False`.***
