To understand the impact of the code on the program, we first need to consider the initial state and then apply the changes made by the given code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than the number of iterations that have occurred so far and less than or equal to 1000.
- `ratings` is a list containing at least one element, which is a tuple of two integers, and includes the tuple `(a, b)`.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- The state of `is_rated` remains as previously determined by the comparison of `a` and `b`.

Code Snippet:
```python
ratings.append((a, b))
```

Impact of the Code:
- The list `ratings` is modified by appending a new tuple `(a, b)` to it. This means the list now contains all its original elements plus the additional tuple `(a, b)`.

Calculating the Result:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. So, `n` is still an integer greater than the number of iterations that have occurred so far and less than or equal to 1000.
- The list `ratings` now contains at least the original elements plus an additional tuple `(a, b)`. Therefore, `ratings` is a list containing all its original tuples plus the newly appended tuple `(a, b)`.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain the same as they are not modified by the code.
- The state of `is_rated` also remains unchanged since the code does not affect it.

Output State:
**`n` is an integer greater than the number of iterations that have occurred so far and less than or equal to 1000, `ratings` is a list containing all its original tuples plus the newly appended tuple `(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and the state of `is_rated` remains as previously determined by the comparison of `a` and `b`.**
