According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`**
