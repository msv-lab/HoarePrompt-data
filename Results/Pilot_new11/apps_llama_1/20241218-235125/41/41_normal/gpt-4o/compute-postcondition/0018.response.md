The code sets `is_rated` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than the number of iterations that have occurred so far and less than or equal to 1000, `ratings` is a list containing all its original tuples plus the newly appended tuple `(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `is_rated` is `True`.
