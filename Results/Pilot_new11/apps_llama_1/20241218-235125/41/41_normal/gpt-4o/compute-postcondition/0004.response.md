According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already given to be an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, this condition is already met for the loop to execute. The loop variable is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop. 

For the loop to execute at least once, no adjustments are needed to the given state because `n` is already within the required range. The loop will execute `n` times.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`**
