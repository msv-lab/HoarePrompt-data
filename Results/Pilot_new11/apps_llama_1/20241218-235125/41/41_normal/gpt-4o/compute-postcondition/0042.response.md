Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers. `is_rated` is `False`, and there does not exist any pair of consecutive tuples in `ratings` where the first element of the first tuple is less than the first element of the second tuple, which implies `is_unrated` is `False`.**
