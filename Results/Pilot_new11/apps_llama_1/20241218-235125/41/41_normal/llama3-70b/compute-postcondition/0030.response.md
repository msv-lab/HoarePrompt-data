The value of `unrated` is updated to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is still a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is still a list of `n` input integers, `rated` remains `False`, `maybe` remains `True`, and `i` is still 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2**
