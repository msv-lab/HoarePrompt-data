The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it uses external input which is a list of pairs of integers representing the rating of each participant before and after the round. The number of participants is a known integer between 2 and 1000. After executing the function body, the functionality of the function is not fully specified in the given problem description. 

To provide a correct answer, the problem description should include the output of the function based on the input. Since this information is missing, let's assume the function will return some value based on the ratings of the participants.


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but uses a list of pairs of integers representing participant ratings before and after a round, and returns a value based on these ratings.**
