Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `maybe` is `True`, if for all pairs of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` implies `ratings_after[i] <= ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `True`, 'unrated' has been printed, and `rated` is `False`; otherwise, `unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, and 'maybe' has been printed, indicating the existence of at least one pair of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`.**
