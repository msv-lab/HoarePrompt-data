The value of `ratings_before` is updated by appending the value of `a` to the list. The initial state of `ratings_before` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `a`, so after appending `a`, it will contain three instances of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing three instances of the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
