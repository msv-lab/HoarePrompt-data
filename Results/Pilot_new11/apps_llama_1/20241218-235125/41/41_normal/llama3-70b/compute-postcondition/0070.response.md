Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. The variable `unrated` was set to `False` if a specific rating inconsistency was found, where there exists at least one `j` in the range `i + 1` to `n` for which `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`. The current value of `unrated` is `False`, indicating that such a rating inconsistency was indeed found.**
