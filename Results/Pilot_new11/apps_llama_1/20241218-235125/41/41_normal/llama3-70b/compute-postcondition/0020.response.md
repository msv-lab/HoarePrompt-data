To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we must analyze the loop statement and the given initial states.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This loop depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `n`, because the `range()` function in Python generates numbers from the start value up to but not including the stop value.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
- `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers.
- `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers.
- `rated` is `False`.
- `unrated` is `True`.
- `maybe` is `True`.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute, considering `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1. Since `n` is between 2 and 1000, `i + 1` (which is 1) is always less than `n`, ensuring the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted or confirmed for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, which is inherently satisfied given `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 0.
- `i` is 0, as given.
- `j` will start at `i + 1`, which means `j` starts at 1.

However, the conditions of `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` do not directly affect the execution of the loop as described. The loop's execution is contingent upon the relationship between `i` and `n`.

Thus, the adjusted state considering the loop's requirements and the initial conditions is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `True`, `maybe` is `True`, `i` is 0, `j` will be 1 at the start of the loop**
