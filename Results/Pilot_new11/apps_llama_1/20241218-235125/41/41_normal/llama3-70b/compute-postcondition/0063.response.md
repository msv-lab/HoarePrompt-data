The code `break` is a statement that terminates the loop it is inside. In this case, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
