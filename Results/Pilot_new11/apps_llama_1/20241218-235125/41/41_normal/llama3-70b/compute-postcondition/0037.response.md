According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified but we know that `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be the next integer in the sequence.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is the next integer in the sequence, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `unrated` is `False`, then `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `unrated` is `True`, then the execution continues without any changes to `rated`, `maybe`, or the loop/state.**
