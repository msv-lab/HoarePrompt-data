The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change. 


Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
