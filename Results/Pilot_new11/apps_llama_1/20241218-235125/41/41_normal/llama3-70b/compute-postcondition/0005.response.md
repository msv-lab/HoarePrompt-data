The code `ratings_before.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the end of the `ratings_before` list. The initial state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.

After executing this code, `ratings_before` is no longer empty but contains the input integer `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
