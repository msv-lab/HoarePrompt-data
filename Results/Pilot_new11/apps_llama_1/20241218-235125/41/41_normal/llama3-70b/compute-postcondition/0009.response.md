The code appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. 

The initial state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the updated input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the updated input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.

After executing the code, `ratings_before` will contain the updated input integer `a` and the value of `a`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the updated input integers `a` and `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the updated input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the updated input integers `a` and `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the updated input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
