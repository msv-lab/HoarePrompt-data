The code sets `unrated` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `unrated` is `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `unrated` is `False`**
