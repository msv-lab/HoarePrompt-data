The code sets `unrated` to `False`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial state of `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. 
These conditions are still valid after the code has been executed.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `unrated` is `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `unrated` is `False`**
