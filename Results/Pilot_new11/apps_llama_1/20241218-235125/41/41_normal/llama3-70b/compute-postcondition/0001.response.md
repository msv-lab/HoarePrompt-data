The code initializes an empty list `ratings_before`. The initial state provides that the number of participants `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000. This information about `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `n`. 

The variable `ratings_before` is assigned the value of an empty list `[]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list**
