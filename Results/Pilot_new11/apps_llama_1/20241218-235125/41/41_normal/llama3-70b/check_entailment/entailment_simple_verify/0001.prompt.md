You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input

1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input

2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings_before.append(a)
        ratings_after.append(b)
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        if not unrated:
            break
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
    if rated:
        print('rated')
    elif unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether a round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated or not. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of participants and their ratings before and after the round.
2. It checks if any participant's rating has changed. If so, it sets `rated` to `True` and breaks the loop.
3. It then checks if any participant with a lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with a higher rating. If so, it sets `unrated` to `False`.
4. Finally, it prints the result based on the values of `rated` and `unrated`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

- If any participant's rating has changed, it prints "rated".
- If no participant's rating has changed and a participant with a lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with a higher rating, it prints "unrated".
- If no participant's rating has changed and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating, it prints "maybe".

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, and it correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
