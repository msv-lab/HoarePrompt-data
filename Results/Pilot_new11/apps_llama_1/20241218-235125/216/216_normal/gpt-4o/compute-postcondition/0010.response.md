Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the string and is a lowercase letter. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `max_count` is 0. If `char` is in `current_set`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.**
