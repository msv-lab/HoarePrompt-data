The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, containing only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means `n` now holds the input integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, containing only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
However we don't know the string yet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is still unknown**
