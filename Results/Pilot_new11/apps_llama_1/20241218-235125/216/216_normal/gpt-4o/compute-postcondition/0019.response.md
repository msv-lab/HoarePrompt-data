Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains `s[1]` and `current_count` is increased by 1. If `char` is in `current_set`, then the state of the program remains unchanged.***
