The code `current_count = 0` resets the value of `current_count` to 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, `max_count` is the maximum of the old `max_count` and the old `current_count` which is now outdated, but since `current_count` has been updated, `max_count` should also be updated to be the maximum of the old `max_count` and the new `current_count` which is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, `max_count` is the maximum of the old `max_count` and 0**
