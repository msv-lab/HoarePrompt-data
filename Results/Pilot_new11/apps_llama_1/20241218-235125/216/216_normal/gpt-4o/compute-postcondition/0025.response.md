The code adds the `char` to the `current_set`. The value of `char` is the third character in the string `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string, `current_set` contains the third character in the string `s` in addition to its previous elements, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string `s`, `current_set` contains the third character in the string `s` in addition to its previous elements, `current_count` remains unchanged, `max_count` remains unchanged**
