The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_count` is unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string `s`, `current_set` contains the third character in the string `s` in addition to its previous elements, `current_count` is `current_count + 1`, `max_count` remains unchanged.
