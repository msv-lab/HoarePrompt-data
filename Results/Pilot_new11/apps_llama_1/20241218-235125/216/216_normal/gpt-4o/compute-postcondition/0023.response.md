Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string. If `char` is lowercase, then if `char` is not in `current_set`, `current_set` contains `s[1]` and `current_count` is increased by 1, otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged. If `char` is not lowercase, then `max_count` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `current_count` is 0, and `current_set` is an empty set.**
