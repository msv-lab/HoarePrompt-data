The code `print(max_count)` simply prints the value of `max_count` to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `s`, `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count` are not changed by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `max_count` is the maximum count of unique lowercase letters seen so far and has been returned at the output, `current_set` is either empty or contains unique lowercase letters from the last sequence of lowercase letters in `s`, `current_count` is either 0 or represents the count of unique lowercase letters in the last sequence of lowercase letters in `s`.**
