#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string s of length n, containing only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `max_count` is the maximum count of unique lowercase letters between any two non-lowercase characters (or the start/end of the string), `current_set` is either empty or contains unique lowercase letters from the last sequence of lowercase letters in `s`, `current_count` is either 0 or represents the count of unique lowercase letters in the last sequence of lowercase letters in `s`.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` as input, where `n` is between 1 and 200 (inclusive) and `s` contains only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It calculates the maximum count of unique lowercase letters between any two non-lowercase characters (or the start/end of the string) in `s`. After processing the input string, the function prints the maximum count of unique lowercase letters found in any such sequence. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotated code and the return postconditions, as the code actually calculates and prints the maximum count of unique lowercase letters, rather than returning "same", "mixed", or "other" based on the string's composition. The function does not handle any potential exceptions, such as invalid input types or lengths, and does not provide any error messages. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has printed the maximum count of unique lowercase letters found in the input string.
