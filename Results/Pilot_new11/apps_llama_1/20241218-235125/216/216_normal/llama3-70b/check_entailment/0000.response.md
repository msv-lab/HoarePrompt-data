Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The program is simply counting the number of lowercase letters in the string, but it does not guarantee that there are no uppercase letters between the positions of these letters, which is a key condition for a "pretty" set of positions. 

For example, if the input string is "aAa", the program will output 2, because there are two lowercase letters, but the positions of these letters (0 and 2) are not a "pretty" set, because there is an uppercase letter between them. 

A correct solution would need to consider all possible subsets of the positions of lowercase letters and check if each subset meets the conditions of a "pretty" set. It would then return the size of the largest such subset. The given program does not perform this check and therefore does not produce the correct output for all inputs. 

Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    max_count = 0
    for mask in range(1 << len(lowercase)):
        subset = [lowercase[i] for i in range(len(lowercase)) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(subset) - 1):
            if any(s[j].isupper() for j in range(subset[i] + 1, subset[i + 1])):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            max_count = max(max_count, len(subset))
    print(max_count)
```
