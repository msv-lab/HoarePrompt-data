You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The program is simply counting the number of lowercase letters in the string, but it does not guarantee that there are no uppercase letters between the positions of these letters, which is a key condition for a "pretty" set of positions. 

For example, if the input string is "aAa", the program will output 2, because there are two lowercase letters, but the positions of these letters (0 and 2) are not a "pretty" set, because there is an uppercase letter between them. 

A correct solution would need to consider all possible subsets of the positions of lowercase letters and check if each subset meets the conditions of a "pretty" set. It would then return the size of the largest such subset. The given program does not perform this check and therefore does not produce the correct output for all inputs. 

Here is an example of a correct solution in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    max_count = 0
    for mask in range(1 << len(lowercase)):
        subset = [lowercase[i] for i in range(len(lowercase)) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(subset) - 1):
            if any(s[j].isupper() for j in range(subset[i] + 1, subset[i + 1])):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            max_count = max(max_count, len(subset))
    print(max_count)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two implicit parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`, reads them from the user input, and then calculates the number of lowercase letters in the string `s`. It returns this count as output, printing it to the console, regardless of the value of `n`. The input integer `n` is not used in the function's logic. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer for `n` and a string for `s`, without performing any error checking. After the function concludes, the program's state is such that the user has been prompted to input an integer and a string, and the number of lowercase letters in the input string has been printed to the console. The function does not modify the input string `s` or store it in any way after processing, and its execution does not depend on the length `n` of the string, despite `n` being input by the user.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
