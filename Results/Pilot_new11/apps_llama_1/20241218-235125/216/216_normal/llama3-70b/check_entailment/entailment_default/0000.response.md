Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem. It simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, which does not satisfy the conditions for a "pretty set" of positions as defined in the problem statement.

A "pretty set" requires that the letters at the positions in the set are distinct and lowercase, and that there are no uppercase letters between any two positions in the set. The code does not check for these conditions.

For example, in the input "aaaaBaabAbA", the code would output 8, which is the total number of lowercase letters. However, the correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, the code would need to iterate over all possible subsets of positions in the string and check if each subset satisfies the conditions for a "pretty set". This would involve checking for distinctness of letters and the absence of uppercase letters between positions. The current code does not perform these checks and therefore does not produce the correct output.
