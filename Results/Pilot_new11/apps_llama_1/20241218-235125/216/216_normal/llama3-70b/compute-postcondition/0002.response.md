The list `lowercase` is created and assigned the indices of characters in the string `s` that are lowercase. The length of string `s` is `n`, and `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive). The string `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

The states of `n` and `s` are not affected. The list `lowercase` is a new variable that contains the indices of lowercase characters in `s`.

The list `lowercase` can be empty if there are no lowercase characters in `s`, or it can contain one or more indices between 0 and `n-1`, depending on the input string `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, with a length of `n`, `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, with a length of `n`, `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`.**
