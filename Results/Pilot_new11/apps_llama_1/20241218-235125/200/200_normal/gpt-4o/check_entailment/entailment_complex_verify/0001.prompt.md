You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program first checks if the total volume of all kegs is less than the desired volume `s`. If so, it immediately returns `-1`, as it's impossible to pour `s` liters from the kegs.

2. The program sorts the keg volumes in ascending order. This is done to easily find the minimum keg volume, which is the volume that the Fair Nut wants to keep in the least keg.

3. The program then iterates through the sorted keg volumes, from smallest to largest. For each keg, it calculates how much kvass can be taken from that keg without reducing the minimum keg volume. This is done by calculating `min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`, which is the minimum of the kvass that can be taken from the current keg and the remaining kvass that needs to be poured.

4. The program continues this process until all the remaining kvass has been poured (`remaining_kvass == 0`) or all kegs have been processed.

5. If there's still remaining kvass that needs to be poured after processing all kegs, the program reduces the minimum keg volume by the amount that's needed to pour the remaining kvass, divided by the number of kegs. This ensures that the Fair Nut pours an equal amount of kvass from each keg, thus maximizing the minimum keg volume.

6. Finally, the program prints the minimum keg volume, which is the amount of kvass that will be left in the least keg after pouring `s` liters.

All the provided examples work correctly with this program, and it seems to handle all edge cases. The program correctly handles cases where it's impossible to pour `s` liters from the kegs, and it correctly calculates the minimum keg volume when it is possible to pour `s` liters. 

Therefore, based on the provided description and examples, the program appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s is a positive integer, and there is a list of n positive integers v_i such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, 1 <= s <= 10^12, and 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for all i.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is the last index that was processed, and `remaining_kvass` is the remaining value after the loop execution, which is either 0 or the remaining value after `n` iterations or the break condition.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, then `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, and `i` is the last index that was processed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, and `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the value -1 has been printed and returned. Otherwise, `total_volume` is larger than or equal to `s`, and the value of `min_keg_volume` has been calculated as `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, and this value has been printed and returned, with `i` being the last index that was processed if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function calculates the minimum possible keg volume that can hold a certain amount of kvass, given a list of kegs with different volumes. The function takes as input the number of kegs `n`, the total amount of kvass `s`, and a list of `n` positive integers representing the volumes of the kegs. It returns the minimum keg volume if the total volume of the kegs is greater than or equal to the amount of kvass, or -1 if the total volume is less than the amount of kvass. The function iterates through the sorted list of keg volumes, and for each keg, it calculates the amount of kvass that can be poured into it without overflowing. If there is still kvass remaining after filling all kegs, it reduces the minimum keg volume by the amount of remaining kvass divided by the number of kegs, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The function handles potential edge cases, such as an empty list of kegs or a total volume that is less than the amount of kvass, and returns the correct result in these cases. The state of the program after execution includes the calculated minimum keg volume, or -1 if the total volume is insufficient, and the remaining amount of kvass if not all of it can be poured into the kegs.
