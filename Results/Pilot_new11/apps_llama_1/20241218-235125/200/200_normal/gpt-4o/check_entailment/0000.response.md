Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. The code first checks if the total volume of all kegs is less than the desired glass volume `s`. If so, it outputs `-1` as it's impossible to pour the glass. 

If the total volume is sufficient, the code sorts the keg volumes in ascending order and initializes `min_keg_volume` to the volume of the smallest keg. It then iterates through the kegs, starting from the smallest, and attempts to pour as much kvass as possible from each keg while maintaining the minimum keg volume. 

The code correctly handles cases where the remaining kvass is not evenly divisible among the kegs, ensuring that the minimum keg volume is maximized. 

I was unable to find a counterexample where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program appears to be correct. 

The program uses a binary search-like approach to maximize the minimum keg volume, ensuring that the Fair Nut can pour his glass with the maximum possible amount of kvass in the least keg. 

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of kegs. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the keg volumes. 

Overall, the program seems to be a correct and efficient solution to the problem.
