Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`, `total_volume` is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, `i` is 0, and if the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, we move to the next iteration in the loop; otherwise, `possible_to_take` is 0.**
