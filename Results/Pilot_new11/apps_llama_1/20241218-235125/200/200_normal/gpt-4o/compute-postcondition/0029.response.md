The value of `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`. The value of `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[2] - volumes[0]` and `remaining_kvass`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 2, `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[2] - volumes[0]` and `remaining_kvass`, `remaining_kvass` is `remaining_kvass` - `possible_to_take`**
