The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not given any loop in the provided code snippet, the effect of `continue` cannot be directly determined. However, assuming it is part of a loop that iterates over the `volumes` list or any other loop that might be present in the larger context of the program (not shown here), the `continue` statement would essentially move on to the next iteration of that loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1,
- `s` is an input integer,
- `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order,
- `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`,
- `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`,
- `i` is 2,

The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables. It merely controls the flow of the program, causing it to skip to the next iteration of the loop it is contained within.

Therefore, after executing the `continue` statement, the values of `n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, and `i` remain unchanged. The program simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop it is part of, without modifying any of the given variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 2, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
