The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration in the loop. Since there are no changes made to the variables in the given code snippet, all the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`, `total_volume` is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, the current value of `min_keg_volume` is the smallest volume in `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, and we move to the next iteration in the loop.**
