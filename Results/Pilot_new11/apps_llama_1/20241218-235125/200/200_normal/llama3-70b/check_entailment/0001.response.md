Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a binary search solution that attempts to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be left in the least full keg after pouring a glass of `s` liters. 

Here's why it works:
- The program first reads the input, sorts the keg volumes in ascending order, and initializes the search range `[low, high]` for the binary search.
- The binary search iteratively calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range and checks if the total amount of kvass that can be poured from all kegs, assuming each keg is `mid` liters or less full, is less than the target amount `s`.
- If the total amount is less than `s`, it means that the current `mid` value is too small, so it updates `low` to `mid`.
- If the total amount is not less than `s`, it means that the current `mid` value might be too large, so it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
- The binary search continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`, at which point `low` is the maximum amount that can be left in the least full keg.
- Finally, it checks if the total amount of kvass that can be poured when each keg is `low` liters or less full is exactly `s`. If not, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `low`.

The program handles edge cases correctly. For instance, if `s` is greater than the total amount of kvass in all kegs, it will correctly print `-1`. 

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program seems correct.
