To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the provided program state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `while low < high:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `low` is less than `high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input integer.
- `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0.
- If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` equals `mid` and `high` is greater than `low`.
- Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `low` is less than or equal to `mid`, where `mid` is updated to `(low + (mid - 1) + 1) // 2` and `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for all `x` in `v`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low < high` must still be true.

If `total` is less than `s`, the adjustments are:
- `low` equals `mid`.
- `high` is greater than `low`.

This scenario does not ensure that the next iteration will meet the loop condition because `low` and `high` could potentially be equal after the update. Thus, the condition that `high` is greater than `low` needs to be explicitly maintained for the next iteration to occur. 

If `total` is not less than `s`, then:
- `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `mid`.

In this case, for the loop to continue, it must be ensured that `low` is less than `high` after the update. Since `high` becomes `mid - 1` and `low` is less than or equal to `mid`, there's a possibility that `low` could be equal to `mid`, which would then be equal to or greater than `high` after the update, potentially ending the loop. Hence, the relationship between `low` and `high` must be such that `low` is strictly less than `high` for the loop to continue.

Considering both scenarios and focusing on the critical condition for the loop to execute again (`low < high`), we conclude that no matter the conditions on `total` and `s`, `low` must be strictly less than `high` for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0, and `low` must be strictly less than `high`.**
