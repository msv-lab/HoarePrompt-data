The value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0, `total` is `mid * len(v)` is no longer valid because mid has been changed, `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `low` is less than `high`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0, `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `low` is less than `high`**
