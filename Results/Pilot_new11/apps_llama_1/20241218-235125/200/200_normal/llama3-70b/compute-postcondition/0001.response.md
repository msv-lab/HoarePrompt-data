The given code overrides the initial value of `v`. Initially, `v` was a list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` is such that 1 <= `v_i` <= 10^9. However, after the execution of the code, `v` becomes a list of integers obtained from the input. The number of integers in `v` and their values are now determined by the input, not necessarily equal to `n` or within the range 1 to 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
