The code `n, s = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `s` respectively. 

Since `n` and `s` are updated to the input values, we can no longer guarantee the original constraints on `n` and `s`. However, the updated values of `n` and `s` are both integers.

The list `v` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of n integers where each integer v_i is such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9**
