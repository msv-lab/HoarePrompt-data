#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, s is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i is such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the original input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `v` is the original sorted list of integers, `low` is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `sum(min(mid, x) for x in v) >= s` or the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition if no such integer is found, `high` is the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition, `mid` is the value that satisfies the condition or the largest value that does not satisfy the condition if no such value is found
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the original input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `v` is the original sorted list of integers, `low` is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `sum(min(mid, x) for x in v) >= s` or the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition if no such integer is found, `high` is the largest integer that does not satisfy the condition, `mid` is the value that satisfies the condition or the largest value that does not satisfy the condition if no such value is found. If the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in `v` is not equal to `s`, then -1 has been printed and returned. Otherwise, the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in `v` is equal to `s`, and the value of `low` has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in the sorted list `v` is equal to or greater than the target sum `s`. If such an integer exists, it returns the smallest integer `low` that satisfies the condition `sum(min(low, x) for x in v) == s`. If no such integer exists, it returns -1. The function accepts input from the user for the number of integers `n` and the target sum `s`, and a list of `n` integers `v`. Upon execution, the function prints and returns either the smallest integer `low` that satisfies the condition or -1 if no such integer is found, with the state of the program retained as the original input integers `n` and `s`, and the original sorted list of integers `v`. The function handles edge cases, including when the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`, and when the input list `v` contains integers that are greater than the target sum `s`.
