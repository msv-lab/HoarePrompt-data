Postcondition: **`node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph where `graph[node]` has at least one neighbor, `visited` is a list or set of integers where `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list or set of integers representing the current recursion stack where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, and `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`. The first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, which is `neighbor`, has been visited, i.e., `visited[neighbor]` is `True`. The current value of `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`, indicating that `neighbor` is in the current recursion stack.**
