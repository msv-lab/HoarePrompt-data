You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: node is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph with n vertices, visited and rec_stack are lists or sets of integers representing the visited vertices and the current recursion stack, respectively.
```
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the condition for the current node in the context of the graph, visited nodes, and recursion stack has been met, specifically for a node that has at least one neighbor in a directed graph where the first neighbor has not been visited before but meets the conditions specified by func_1.

Case_2: The program returns True, indicating a cycle is detected in the graph, where 'node' is a valid vertex, 'graph' is a directed graph with 'node' having at least one neighbor, 'visited[node]' and 'visited[neighbor]' are True, and 'rec_stack[node]' and 'rec_stack[neighbor]' are True, and 'neighbor' is the first neighbor of 'node' in 'graph[node]'

Case_3: The program returns True, indicating a value of boolean type

Case_4: The program returns True, indicating a valid result for a node in the graph with at least two neighbors, where the current node has been visited and is in the recursion stack.

Case_5: The program returns boolean value True, for a node in a directed graph where the node has at least three neighbors, the node is marked as visited, and the node is in the current recursion stack, and the third neighbor is one of the node's neighbors in the graph

Case_6: The program returns True, indicating a boolean value where node is a valid vertex in the graph with at least three neighbors, and the current recursion stack rec_stack and visited list have node marked as True

Case_7: The program returns False

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
