You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph with n vertices, visited and rec_stack are lists or sets of integers representing the visited vertices and the current recursion stack, respectively.
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` remains unchanged, `visited` reflects the visitation state of all neighbors of `node` after traversal, and `rec_stack` represents the recursion stack state after visiting all neighbors of `node`. If the graph contains a cycle reachable from `node`, the program returns True; otherwise, the return value depends on the implementation of `func_1`. If `graph[node]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the initial state of `visited` and `rec_stack` is preserved.
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters node, graph, visited, and rec_stack, and returns a boolean value based on the evaluation of the node in the context of the graph, visited nodes, and recursion stack.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the condition for the current node in the context of the graph, visited nodes, and recursion stack has been met, specifically for a node that has at least one neighbor in a directed graph where the first neighbor has not been visited before but meets the conditions specified by func_1.

Case_2: The program returns True, indicating a cycle is detected in the graph, where 'node' is a valid vertex, 'graph' is a directed graph with 'node' having at least one neighbor, 'visited[node]' and 'visited[neighbor]' are True, and 'rec_stack[node]' and 'rec_stack[neighbor]' are True, and 'neighbor' is the first neighbor of 'node' in 'graph[node]'

Case_3: The program returns True, indicating a value of boolean type

Case_4: The program returns True, indicating a valid result for a node in the graph with at least two neighbors, where the current node has been visited and is in the recursion stack.

Case_5: The program returns boolean value True, for a node in a directed graph where the node has at least three neighbors, the node is marked as visited, and the node is in the current recursion stack, and the third neighbor is one of the node's neighbors in the graph

Case_6: The program returns True, indicating a boolean value where node is a valid vertex in the graph with at least three neighbors, and the current recursion stack rec_stack and visited list have node marked as True

Case_7: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
