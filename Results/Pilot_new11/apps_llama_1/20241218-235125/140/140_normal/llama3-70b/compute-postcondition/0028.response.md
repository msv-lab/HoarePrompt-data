Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks for the presence of a cycle in a directed graph starting from a given vertex `node`. It accepts four parameters: `node` (the current vertex), `graph` (the adjacency list or matrix representation of the graph), `visited` (a list or set of visited vertices), and `rec_stack` (a list or set representing the current recursion stack). The function returns `True` if a cycle is detected and `False` otherwise. After execution, the `visited` list reflects the visitation state of all vertices reachable from `node`, and the `rec_stack` represents the recursion stack state after visiting all these vertices. The function handles various cases, including when the graph contains a cycle reachable from `node`, when `node` has unvisited neighbors, and when `node` has no neighbors. The function's return value indicates whether a cycle is detected, and its side effects update the `visited` and `rec_stack` data structures to reflect the traversal state. Edge cases, such as an empty graph or a node with no neighbors, are implicitly handled by the function's recursive structure and the base case `return False` statement.**
