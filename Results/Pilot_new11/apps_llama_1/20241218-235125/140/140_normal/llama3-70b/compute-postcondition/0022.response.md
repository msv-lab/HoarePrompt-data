Postcondition: ***`node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph where `graph[node]` has at least three neighbors, `visited` is a list or set of integers where `visited[node]` is `True`, and `rec_stack` is a list or set of integers representing the current recursion stack where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If the third neighbor of `node` is in the recursion stack `rec_stack`, the program returns True, indicating a cycle detection. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
