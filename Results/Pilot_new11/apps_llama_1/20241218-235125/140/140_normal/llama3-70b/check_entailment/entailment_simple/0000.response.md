Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. However, the given program does not implement this functionality correctly. It simply detects if the graph is acyclic or not, but it does not check if removing one edge can make it acyclic.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check all possible edges in the graph and temporarily remove each one, then check if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it finds an edge that, when removed, makes the graph acyclic, it should print "YES". If it checks all edges and none of them make the graph acyclic when removed, it should print "NO".

The given program only checks if the original graph is acyclic and prints "YES" if it is, and "NO" if it is not. It does not consider the case where removing one edge can make the graph acyclic, which is the main requirement of the problem.

Here is a high level idea of how the correct program should look like:
- First, check if the graph is already acyclic. If it is, print "YES".
- If the graph is not acyclic, then for each edge in the graph, temporarily remove the edge and check if the resulting graph is acyclic.
- If removing any edge makes the graph acyclic, print "YES".
- If none of the above conditions are met, print "NO".

The given program does not follow this logic and therefore does not solve the problem as described in the problem description.
