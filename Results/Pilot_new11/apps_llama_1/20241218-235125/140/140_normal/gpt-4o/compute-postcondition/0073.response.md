Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing where `in_degree[neighbor]` equals `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `node` has at least one more neighbor in `graph`, `count` is unchanged. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `queue` contains the recently added `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` does not contain the last node that was processed.***
