The code introduces a new variable `count` and assigns it the value 0. The previous values of the variables `graph`, `n`, `in_degree`, and `queue` are not affected.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the original number of vertices in the graph, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph and each value is the actual in-degree of that vertex, `queue` is a deque containing all nodes in `in_degree` with an in-degree of 0, and `count` is 0**
