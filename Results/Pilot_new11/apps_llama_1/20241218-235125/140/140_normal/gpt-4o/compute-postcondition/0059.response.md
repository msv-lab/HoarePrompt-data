The code appends `neighbor` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a list of neighbors with at least one less neighbor to process, `n` is a non-negative integer, `node` is the same node, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees, `count` is consistent with the processing of one more neighbor of the `node` in the `graph`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`. 

After appending `neighbor` to the `queue`, the `queue` now contains the updated nodes with in-degrees, including the newly added `neighbor`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a list of neighbors with at least one less neighbor to process, `n` is a non-negative integer, `node` is the same node, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees including the newly added `neighbor`, `count` is consistent with the processing of one more neighbor of the `node` in the `graph`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`.**
