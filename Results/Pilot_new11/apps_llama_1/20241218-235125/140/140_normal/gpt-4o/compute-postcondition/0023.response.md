The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `in_degree[v]` reflects the in-degrees of all vertices directly reachable from the current `u`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one more vertex, `n` is at least 2, `u` is the current vertex in `graph`, `v` is the next adjacent vertex of the current `u`, `graph[u]` has at least one adjacent vertex, `in_degree[v]` is the previous in-degree of `v` plus 1, and `in_degree` has updated values to reflect the in-degrees of all vertices directly reachable from the current `u`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one more vertex, `n` is at least 2, `u` is the current vertex in `graph`, `v` is the next adjacent vertex of the current `u`, `graph[u]` has at least one adjacent vertex, `in_degree[v]` is `in_degree[v] + 1`, and `in_degree` has updated values to reflect the in-degrees of all vertices directly reachable from the current `u`.**
