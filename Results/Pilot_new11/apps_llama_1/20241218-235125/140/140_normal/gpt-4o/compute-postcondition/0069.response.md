Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing, `queue` does not contain the last node that was processed, `node` is the node that was just removed from the `queue` and has at least one neighbor in `graph`, `count` is `count + 1`, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `neighbor` is added to the `queue`.***
