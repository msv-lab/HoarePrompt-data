Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list of neighbors, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after further processing, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees, `node` is the leftmost node that was previously in the `queue`, and `count` is consistent with the processing of one more node in the graph; if `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then the `neighbor` node is added to the `queue`, otherwise, the state of the `queue` remains unchanged with one less node than before, and for each `neighbor`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1***
