The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, except that `count` is now consistent with the processing of one more neighbor of the `node` in the `graph`. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a list of neighbors with at least one less neighbor to process, `n` is a non-negative integer, `node` is the same node, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees, `count` is consistent with the processing of one more neighbor of the `node` in the `graph`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a list of neighbors with at least one less neighbor to process, `n` is a non-negative integer, `node` is the same node, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees, `count` is consistent with the processing of one more neighbor of the `node` in the `graph`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`**
