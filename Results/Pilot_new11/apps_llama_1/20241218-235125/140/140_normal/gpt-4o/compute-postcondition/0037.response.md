The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph including `node` and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex, `in_degree[neighbor]` is one less than its previous value, `queue` is not empty and contains either the same number of nodes as before with a new `neighbor` as the rightmost node if the updated `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, or one less node than before, `count` is any number, and `node` has at least one more neighbor in `graph[node]`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph including `node` and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex, `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, `queue` is not empty and contains either the same number of nodes as before with a new `neighbor` as the rightmost node if `in_degree[neighbor] - 1` is 0, or one less node than before, `count` is any number, and `node` has at least one more neighbor in `graph[node]`.**
