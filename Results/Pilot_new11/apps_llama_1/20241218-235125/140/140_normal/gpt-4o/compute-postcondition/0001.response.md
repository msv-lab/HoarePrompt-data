To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for u in graph:
    # the loop body is omitted
```
The loop will iterate over each key `u` in the `graph` dictionary. For this loop to execute, `graph` must not be empty, meaning it must have at least one key (vertex) to iterate over.

Initial state:
- `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and each value is 0.

Adjusted state for the loop to execute:
- `graph` must not be empty, implying it has at least one vertex (key).
- Since `graph` is related to `n` (the number of vertices), `n` must be at least 1 for the graph to have vertices.
- `u` will take the value of each vertex (key) in `graph` during each iteration, starting with the first key.
- The state of `in_degree` having all values as 0 does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute but is part of the overall state.

Thus, considering the requirement for the loop to execute, the adjusted state should reflect that `graph` has at least one vertex, `n` is at least 1, and `u` will iterate over each vertex in `graph`.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one vertex, `n` is at least 1, `in_degree` has all values as 0, and `u` is the first vertex in `graph`**
