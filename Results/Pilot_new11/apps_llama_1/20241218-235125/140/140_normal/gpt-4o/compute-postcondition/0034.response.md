The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` node to the end of the `queue`. The previous state of the `queue` was that it contained one less node than before and was not empty. After appending `neighbor`, the `queue` now contains the same number of nodes as before, and `neighbor` is now the rightmost node in `queue`. 

The other variables are not affected by this operation. The `graph` is still a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` remains a non-negative integer representing the original number of vertices in the graph, `in_degree` is still a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex, and `count` remains unchanged. The `node` is still the leftmost node that was in `queue` before the operation. The current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is still 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph including `node` and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex with `in_degree[neighbor]` equal to 0, `queue` contains the same number of nodes as before and is not empty with `neighbor` as the rightmost node, `count` is any number, and `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue`.**
