Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a list of neighbors with at least one more neighbor to process, `n` is a non-negative integer, `node` is the same node. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees including the newly added `neighbor`, and `count` is consistent with the processing of another neighbor of the node in the graph. Otherwise, `in_degree[neighbor]` is greater than 0, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees, and `count` is consistent with the processing of another neighbor of the node in the graph.***
