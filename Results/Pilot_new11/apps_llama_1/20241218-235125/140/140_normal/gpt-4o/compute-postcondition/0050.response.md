Postcondition: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list of neighbors, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after further processing, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees and has one less node than before, `node` is the leftmost node that was previously in the `queue`, and `count` is consistent with the processing of one more node in the graph. For each `neighbor`, the current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, after being decremented by 1 from its previous value, indicating that `neighbor` has no incoming edges from other vertices that have not been processed yet.**
