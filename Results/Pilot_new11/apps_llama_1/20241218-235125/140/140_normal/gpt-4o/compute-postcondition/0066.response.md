The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices where `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after decreasing the in-degree of `neighbor` by 1, `queue` is one node shorter and does not contain the last node that was processed, `node` is the node that was just removed from the `queue` and has at least one neighbor in `graph`, and `count` is `count + 1`.
