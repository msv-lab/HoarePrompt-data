Correctness: **True**.

The provided code seems to correctly implement the problem description. It correctly checks if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `has_cycle`. The `func_1` function checks if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge, and the `has_cycle` function checks if a graph contains a cycle.

The `has_cycle` function works by using the concept of in-degree. It calculates the in-degree of each node and then performs a topological sorting using a queue. If the graph is acyclic, then all nodes should be visited during the topological sorting. If any nodes remain unvisited, then the graph contains a cycle.

The `func_1` function first checks if the original graph contains a cycle. If it does, then it iterates through each edge in the graph, removes the edge, and checks if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found after checking all edges, it returns 'NO'.

The output hints agree with the code, and the examples provided in the problem description also match the expected output of the code. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code seems to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs. 

The code handles all potential cases, including empty graphs, graphs with multiple connected components, and graphs with no nodes having an in-degree of 0. It correctly identifies whether the removal of a single edge can make the graph acyclic. 

So, the code does what the problem description says for every potential case.
