You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function checks if a directed graph, represented by the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a list of edges `edges`, can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. It returns 'YES' if such an edge exists and 'NO' otherwise. The function iterates through all edges, checking if the removal of each edge results in an acyclic graph. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it immediately returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found after checking all edges, it returns 'NO'. The function handles graphs with any number of vertices and edges, including empty graphs, and correctly identifies whether the removal of a single edge can make the graph acyclic.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `has_cycle` checks if a directed graph contains nodes that are not reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0. It accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph and an implicit integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the graph, where each key in the dictionary is a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has a directed edge to. The function returns `True` if the graph contains nodes that are not reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0, indicating the presence of a cycle or disconnected nodes; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles all potential cases, including empty graphs, graphs with multiple connected components, and graphs with no nodes having an in-degree of 0. However, it assumes that the input graph is a valid dictionary representation of a directed graph and does not contain any self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. The function's return value indicates whether the graph contains a cycle or has disconnected nodes, but does not provide any information about the specific cycle or disconnected nodes.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
