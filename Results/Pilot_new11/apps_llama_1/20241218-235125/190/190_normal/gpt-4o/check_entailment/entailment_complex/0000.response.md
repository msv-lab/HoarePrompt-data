Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input, which consists of an integer `n` representing the number of sticks and `n` integers `a_i` representing the lengths of the sticks.

2. **Loop Over Possible Target Lengths**: The program iterates over all possible target lengths `t` from 1 to 100. For each `t`, it calculates the cost of adjusting the lengths of all sticks to be within 1 unit of `t`.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is also correct. For each stick length, if the length is less than `t - 1`, the cost is `t - 1 - length` (to adjust it to `t - 1`), and if the length is greater than `t + 1`, the cost is `length - (t + 1)` (to adjust it to `t + 1`). This matches the problem description.

4. **Finding the Optimal Target Length**: The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding optimal target length `best_t`. It correctly updates these values whenever it finds a target length with a lower total cost.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the optimal target length `best_t` and the minimum cost, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

This analysis shows that the program correctly implements the problem description, covering all potential cases and edge cases within the specified input constraints.
