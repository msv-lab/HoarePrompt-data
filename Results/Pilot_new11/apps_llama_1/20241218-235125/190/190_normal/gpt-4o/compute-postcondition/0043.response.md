Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `length` is the second element of `a`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 2. If `length` is less than 1, `current_cost` is increased by `1 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, no changes are made to `current_cost`. If `length` is greater than 3, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 3`.***
