The given code snippet is `current_cost += t - 1 - length`. To determine the output state, we need to analyze how this line affects the variables.

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). This variable is not affected by the code.
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements. This variable is not affected by the code.
- `length` is the third element of `a`. This variable is not affected by the code.
- `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far. This variable is not affected by the code.
- `best_t` is either -1 or 1. This variable is not affected by the code.
- `t` is 3. This variable is used in the calculation but its value is not changed by the code.
- `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. Since `t` is 3, this simplifies to `current_cost += 3 - 1 - length`, which further simplifies to `current_cost += 2 - length`.

Given that `length` is the third element of `a` and `t` is 3, the change in `current_cost` depends on the value of `length`. However, since we do not have a specific value for `length` (or `current_cost` initially), we express the change in terms of `length`.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), 
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, 
- `length` is the third element of `a`, 
- `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, 
- `best_t` is either -1 or 1, 
- `t` is 3, 
- `current_cost` is increased by `2 - length`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `length` is the third element of `a`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 3, `current_cost` is increased by `2 - length`.**
