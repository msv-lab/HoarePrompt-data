Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers. If `current_cost` is less than the initial `min_cost`, then `min_cost` equals `current_cost`, `best_t` is 1, and `t` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` remain unchanged, with `min_cost` being positive infinity and `best_t` being -1 initially.***
