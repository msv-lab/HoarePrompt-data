`current_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost` plus `t - 1 - length`. The value of `t` is 3 and the value of `length` is the third element in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `current_cost` was not defined in the initial state, we can only express its new value in terms of its old value. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the third element in `a`, `current_cost` is `current_cost` + 3 - 1 - `length` = `current_cost` + 2 - `length`**
