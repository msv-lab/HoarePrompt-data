Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (i.e., `length` < 1), then `current_cost` is increased by `1 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (i.e., `length` >= 1) and `length` is greater than `t + 1` (i.e., `length` > 3), then `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3`. If `length` is between `t - 1` and `t + 1` (inclusive) (i.e., 1 <= `length` <= 3), no change is made to `current_cost`.***
