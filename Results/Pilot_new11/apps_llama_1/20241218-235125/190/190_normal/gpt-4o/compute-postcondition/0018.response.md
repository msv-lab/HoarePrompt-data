Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1. If `length` is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` and less than or equal to `t + 1`, then no change is made to `current_cost`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `length - 2`.***
