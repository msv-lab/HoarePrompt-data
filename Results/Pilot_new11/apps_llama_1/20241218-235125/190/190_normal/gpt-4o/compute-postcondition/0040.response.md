The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. The value of `t` is 2, and the value of `length` is the second element of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `length` is the second element of `a`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is increased by `2 - 1 - length` which equals `1 - length`**
