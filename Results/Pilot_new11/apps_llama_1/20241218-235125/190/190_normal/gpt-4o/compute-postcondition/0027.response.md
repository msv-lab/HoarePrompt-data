The code updates the value of `best_t` to be equal to `t`. The previous values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `current_cost` are not affected. Since `t` is 1, `best_t` becomes 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` equals `current_cost`, `best_t` is 1, `t` is 1**
