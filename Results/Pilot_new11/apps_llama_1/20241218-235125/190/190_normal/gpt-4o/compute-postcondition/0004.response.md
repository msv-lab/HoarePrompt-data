According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `t`. Since the loop is defined as `for t in range(1, 101):`, it will execute as long as the loop body is valid, regardless of the initial values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t`. The loop variable `t` will start from 1 and go up to 100.

At the start of the loop, `t` is 1, because that's where the range starts. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
