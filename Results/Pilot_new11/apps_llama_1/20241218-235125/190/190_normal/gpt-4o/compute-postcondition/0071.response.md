To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state:

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the third element in `a`.

Given code:
```python
current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```

Here, `current_cost` is not defined in the initial state, so we will consider it as a new variable. 

Since `t` is 3, `t + 1` equals 4. The value of `length` is the third element in `a`. 

The new value of `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`. 

As `n` and `a` are not affected by the code and `t` remains the same, the output state is: 
`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the third element in `a`, and `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`.

However, the initial state of `current_cost` is not defined. 

If we consider the previous value of `current_cost` as `x`, then the new value of `current_cost` is `x + length - 4`. 

Therefore, considering `current_cost` as a new variable with an initial value `x`, we get:
`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the third element in `a`, and `current_cost` is `x + length - 4`, where `x` is the previous value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the third element in `a`, and `current_cost` is `x + length - 4**, where `x` is the previous value of `current_cost`**.
