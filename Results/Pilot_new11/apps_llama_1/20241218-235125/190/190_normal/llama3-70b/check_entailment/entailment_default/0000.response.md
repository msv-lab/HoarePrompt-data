Correctness: **False**.

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through potential stick lengths from the middle value of the sorted list down to 1 and up to 100, calculating the minimum cost at each step. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution, as it only considers the middle value and its adjacent lengths.

A case where the code does not work correctly is when the optimal solution is to choose a stick length that is not the middle value or its adjacent lengths. For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 10, 10, 10], the optimal solution is to choose a stick length of 1 or 10, with a minimum cost of 0. However, the code may not consider these lengths if they are not the middle value or its adjacent lengths.

To achieve the optimal solution, the code should iterate through all possible stick lengths and calculate the minimum cost for each length. The correct code should look something like this:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_t = None
    for t in range(1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - t), abs(x - (t - 1)) if x >= t else abs(x - t), abs(x - (t + 1))) for x in sticks)
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = t
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```
This code iterates through all possible stick lengths from 1 to 100 and calculates the minimum cost for each length. It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding stick length, and finally prints the optimal solution.
