To calculate the output state, let's break down the given information and the code's impact:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`.
   - `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers.
   - `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`.
   - `i` is `mid + 3`.
   - `cost` is the sum of the minimum of the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 3` and the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 2`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The code assigns `min_cost = cost`. This means `min_cost` is now equal to the current value of `cost`.

3. **Output State Calculation**:
   - The value of `n`, `sticks`, `mid`, and `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify these variables.
   - `cost` remains unchanged because the code only assigns its value to `min_cost`, not modifying `cost` itself.
   - A new variable, `min_cost`, is introduced and assigned the value of `cost`. Therefore, `min_cost` is now equal to the sum of the minimum of the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 3` and the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 2`.

**Output State: `n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is `mid + 3`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum of the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 3` and the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 2`, and `min_cost` equals `cost`.**
