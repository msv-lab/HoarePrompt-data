Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`. If the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and the stick lengths `mid` and `mid + 1` is less than the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around stick lengths from `mid - 1` down to `1`, then `min_cost` is equal to this sum, `min_t` is `mid + 1`, and `i` is `mid + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as it was before the if statement, with `min_cost` being the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around stick lengths from `mid - 1` down to `1`, and `min_t` being the stick length that yields `min_cost`.***
