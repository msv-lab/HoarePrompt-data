The given Python code snippet is a print statement that prints the values of `min_t` and `min_cost`. This statement does not change the values of any variables, it simply outputs the current values of `min_t` and `min_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around stick lengths from `mid` to `100`, `min_t` is the stick length that yields `min_cost`, and the values of `min_t` and `min_cost` have been printed.**
