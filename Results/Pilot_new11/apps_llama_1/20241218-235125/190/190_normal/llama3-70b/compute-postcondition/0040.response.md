Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is `mid + 3`, if the sum of the minimum of the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 3` and the absolute difference between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 2` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` equals this sum, and `min_t` equals `mid + 3`.**
