The value of `cost` is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and the middle stick length `mid`. Since `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, it is the median of the stick lengths. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`. 

The value of `n` is still an input integer, where 1 <= `n` <= 1000. 

The value of `sticks` is still a sorted list of `n` positive integers representing stick lengths, where each stick length is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), in ascending order. 

The value of `mid` is still the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers representing stick lengths, where each stick length is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), in ascending order, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, and `cost` is equal to `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`**
