`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`, which equals `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`, where `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, and `n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `cost` equals `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`, `t` equals `mid`, which is `sticks[n // 2]`, and `min_cost` equals `cost` which is `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks`, `cost` equals `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`, `t` equals `mid`, which is `sticks[n // 2]`, and `min_cost` equals `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`**
