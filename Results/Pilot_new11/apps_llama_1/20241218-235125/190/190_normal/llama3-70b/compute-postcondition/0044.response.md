Functionality: **The function accepts a list of positive integers representing stick lengths and returns the optimal stick length and the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around this length. The function first sorts the input list in ascending order, then iterates through potential stick lengths from the middle value down to 1 and up to 100, calculating the minimum cost at each step. The minimum cost is determined by summing the minimum absolute differences between each stick length and the current potential stick length or its adjacent length. The function returns the optimal stick length and the corresponding minimum cost achievable, handling all input scenarios within the defined constraints (1 <= n <= 1000 and 1 <= each stick length <= 100) and edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element are implicitly handled by the input validation and iteration logic, though explicit error handling for these cases is not included in the provided code.**
