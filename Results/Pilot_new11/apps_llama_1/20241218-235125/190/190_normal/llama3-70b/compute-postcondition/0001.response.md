The code creates a list of integers `sticks` based on the input. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings, and `map(int,...)` converts each substring to an integer. 

The initial state is: n is an input integer, where 1 <= n <= 1000.

After executing the code, `sticks` is a list of n positive integers representing stick lengths, where each stick length is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), as per the input.

Output State: **n is an input integer, where 1 <= n <= 1000, and `sticks` is a list of n positive integers representing stick lengths, where each stick length is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), as per the input.**
