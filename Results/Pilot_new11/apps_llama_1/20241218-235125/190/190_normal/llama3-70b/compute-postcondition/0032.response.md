The code calculates the total cost by summing the minimum absolute difference between each stick length `x` in the `sticks` list and the two reference values `i` and `i - 1`. 

Here, `n` is still an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is still a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is still the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is still `mid + 2`. 

`cost` is assigned the value of the sum of the minimum absolute differences.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length `x` in `sticks` and `i` and `i - 1`.**
