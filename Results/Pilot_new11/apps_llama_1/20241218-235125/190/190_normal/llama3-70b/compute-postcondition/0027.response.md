Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost achievable by considering partitions around stick lengths from `mid - 1` down to `1`, `min_t` is the stick length that yields `min_cost`, `i` is `mid + 1`, the current value of `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and the stick lengths `mid` and `mid + 1`, and the current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.**
