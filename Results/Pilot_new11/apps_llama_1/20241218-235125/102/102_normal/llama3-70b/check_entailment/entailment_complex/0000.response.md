Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input values `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, which are the total amount of money, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of one Bars bar, respectively.

2. It then checks all possible combinations of buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and `y` Bars bars such that `x * a + y * b == n`. This is done by iterating over all possible values of `x` from 0 to `n // a` (inclusive) and calculating the corresponding `y` value.

3. If it finds a combination where `x * a + y * b == n`, it prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y`, indicating that it is possible to spend exactly `n` burles. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

The program correctly handles all possible cases because:

- It checks all possible values of `x` from 0 to `n // a`, ensuring that it covers all possible combinations of buying Ber-Cola and Bars bars.
- It correctly calculates the corresponding `y` value for each `x` value, ensuring that it considers all possible ways to spend exactly `n` burles.
- It checks whether `x * a + y * b == n` for each combination, ensuring that it only prints 'YES' when a valid combination is found.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and will produce the correct output for all possible input values.
