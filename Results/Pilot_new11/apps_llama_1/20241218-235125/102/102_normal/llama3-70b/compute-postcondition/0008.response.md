The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. Therefore, the states of the variables do not change, but the program ends. 'YES' has been printed, and `0` and `n // b` have been printed before the program termination.


Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, `x` multiplied by `a` plus `y` multiplied by `b` equals `n`, 'YES' has been printed, `0` and `n // b` have been printed, and the program has been terminated**
