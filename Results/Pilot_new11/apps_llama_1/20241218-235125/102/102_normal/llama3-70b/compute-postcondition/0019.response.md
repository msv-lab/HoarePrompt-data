The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is 2, and the value of `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed before. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, 'YES' and the value of `x` and `y` have been printed.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, 'YES' and the values 2 and `(n - 2 * a) // b` have been printed**
