The given code simply prints the string 'YES' and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, and 'YES' has been printed**
