The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. The values 'YES', 2, and `(n - 2 * a) // b` have been printed before the program terminates.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, 'YES' and the values 2 and `(n - 2 * a) // b` have been printed, and the program has terminated**
