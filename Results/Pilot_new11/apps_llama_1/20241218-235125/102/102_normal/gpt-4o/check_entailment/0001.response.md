Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and accurately solves the problem described. It iterates through all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) up to `n // a` (the maximum number of bottles Vasya can afford). For each value of `x`, it checks if the remaining amount `n - x * a` can be divided evenly by `b` (the cost of a Bars bar), which would mean that Vasya can buy some number of Bars bars with the remaining amount. If such a value of `x` is found, the program prints 'YES' along with the corresponding values of `x` and `y` (the number of Bars bars), and then exits.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the scenario where Vasya spends all his money on either only Ber-Cola or only Bars bars (since `x` can range from 0 to `n // a`, and `y` is calculated based on the remaining amount after spending on `x` Ber-Cola). If no suitable combination of `x` and `y` is found after checking all possibilities for `x`, the program correctly prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles.

The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the program only considers whole numbers of bottles and bars, as required by the problem. The modulo operation (`%`) checks for the remainder when dividing `n - x * a` by `b`, allowing the program to determine if the remaining amount can be spent exactly on Bars bars.

After examining the code and considering various potential inputs and cases, there does not appear to be any scenario where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
