You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and accurately solves the problem described. It iterates through all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) up to `n // a` (the maximum number of bottles Vasya can afford). For each value of `x`, it checks if the remaining amount `n - x * a` can be divided evenly by `b` (the cost of a Bars bar), which would mean that Vasya can buy some number of Bars bars with the remaining amount. If such a value of `x` is found, the program prints 'YES' along with the corresponding values of `x` and `y` (the number of Bars bars), and then exits.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the scenario where Vasya spends all his money on either only Ber-Cola or only Bars bars (since `x` can range from 0 to `n // a`, and `y` is calculated based on the remaining amount after spending on `x` Ber-Cola). If no suitable combination of `x` and `y` is found after checking all possibilities for `x`, the program correctly prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles.

The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the program only considers whole numbers of bottles and bars, as required by the problem. The modulo operation (`%`) checks for the remainder when dividing `n - x * a` by `b`, allowing the program to determine if the remaining amount can be spent exactly on Bars bars.

After examining the code and considering various potential inputs and cases, there does not appear to be any scenario where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) representing the amount of money, a is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) representing the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and b is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) representing the cost of one Bars bar, where Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars such that x·a + y·b = n, and x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
            y = (n - x * a) // b
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, and either the loop completed without finding a solution (in which case `x` is `n // a`) or the loop found a solution and returned (in which case the final values of `x` and `y` are the solution values).
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines whether it's possible to spend a given amount of money on two items with specific costs, and if so, finds the number of each item that can be bought. It accepts three implicit parameters: the amount of money and the costs of two items, all positive integers. The function then attempts to find non-negative integer values of x and y such that x times the cost of the first item plus y times the cost of the second item equals the given amount of money. If such values are found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of x and y, and returns None. If no such values are found after checking all possible combinations, it prints "NO" and returns None. The function handles cases where the amount of money is not enough to buy at least one item, as well as cases where the costs of the items are such that no combination can sum up to the given amount of money, by printing "NO" in such scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
