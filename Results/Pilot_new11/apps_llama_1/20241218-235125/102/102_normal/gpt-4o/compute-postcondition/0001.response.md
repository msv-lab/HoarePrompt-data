The value of `a` is updated to be an integer input by the user. The previous value of `a` and the values of `n` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000), `a` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000), `a` is an input integer**
