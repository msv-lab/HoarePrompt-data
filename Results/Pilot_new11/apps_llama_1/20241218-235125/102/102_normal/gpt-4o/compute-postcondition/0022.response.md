To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the conditions provided in the output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is as follows:
```python
for x in range(n // a + 1):
    if (n - x * a) % b == 0:
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        print('YES')
        print(x, y)
        return
```
From the loop code, we can see that it iterates over a range of values for `x`, from 0 to `n // a` (inclusive). Inside the loop, it checks if `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`. If it is, the function prints 'YES' and the values of `x` and `y`, and then returns.

Now, let's analyze the output states for the first few iterations:

* Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 0, and `(n - x * a) % b` is not equal to 0.
* Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 1. If `(n - a)` is divisible by `b`, the function returns None. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.
* Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 2, and `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`. If `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`, the program returns None. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.

From these output states, we can see that the loop will execute as long as `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`. If `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b` at any point during the loop, the function will return.

Now, let's consider what happens after all iterations of the loop have finished. There are two possible scenarios:

1. The loop completes without finding a value of `x` for which `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`. In this case, the loop will iterate over all values of `x` from 0 to `n // a`, and the final value of `x` will be `n // a`.
2. The loop finds a value of `x` for which `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`, and the function returns. In this case, the loop will not complete, and the final value of `x` will be the value for which `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`.

In either case, the values of `n`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged, as they are input variables that are not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, and either the loop completed without finding a solution (in which case `x` is `n // a`) or the loop found a solution and returned (in which case the final values of `x` and `y` are the solution values).**
