The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This operation does not modify the values of any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, and 'YES' has been printed**
