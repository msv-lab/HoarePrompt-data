Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 1. If `(n - a)` is divisible by `b`, the function returns None. Otherwise, no specific action is taken, retaining the original conditions: `n` is greater than or equal to `-a` and `(n - a)` is not divisible by `b`.**
