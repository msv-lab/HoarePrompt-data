According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have at least one more iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 0 and ending at any index up to `n - 1`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes**
