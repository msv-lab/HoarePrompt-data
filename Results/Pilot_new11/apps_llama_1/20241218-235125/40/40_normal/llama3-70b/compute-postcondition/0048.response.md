To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        substr = s[i:j]
        if substr!= substr[::-1]:
            max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```
The loop iterates over all possible substrings of `s` and checks if they are palindromic. If a non-palindromic substring is found, its length is compared to the current `max_len`, and `max_len` is updated if the new length is greater.

From the output states for the first few iterations, we can see that:

* `s` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
* `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
* `i` takes on values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop.
* `max_len` is initially 0 and is updated to be the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at any index up to `n-1`, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `n-1`, because it takes on values from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `max_len` will be the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), `max_len` will remain 0, because there are no substrings to check.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is `n-1`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.**
