The code `substr = s[i:j]` creates a new variable `substr` and assigns it the value of the substring of `s` from index `i` to `j`. 

Given the initial state: `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `substr` will be assigned the value of the first two characters of `s`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is a string equal to the first two characters of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is a string equal to `s[0:2]`.**
