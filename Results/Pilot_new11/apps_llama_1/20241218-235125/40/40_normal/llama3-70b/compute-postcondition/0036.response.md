Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 1 and ending at any index up to `n`, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes, `j` is 3, and `substr` is a string of length 1 equal to the third character of `s`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, meaning `substr` is not a palindrome.**
