To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than `i`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- If `substr` (the first character of `s`) is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is 1. If `substr` is a palindrome, the state of `max_len` is not updated and remains 0.

Given loop statement:
```
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Analysis:
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` should become 2 because the `range` function generates numbers from `i + 1` up to but not including `n + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue depends solely on `j` being less than `n + 1`, and since `n` is greater than `i`, and initially `i` is 0, we only need to ensure `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time when `j` is 2.

Adjusted state:
- `s` remains the same, as there's no operation in the loop that changes it based on the information given.
- `n` must be at least 2 to allow `j` to reach 2.
- `i` remains 0, as it does not change within the loop based on the given information.
- `j` needs to be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
