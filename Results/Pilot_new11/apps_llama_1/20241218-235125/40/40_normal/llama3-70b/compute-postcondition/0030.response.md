Given the initial state and the provided Python code, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program.

The initial state is as follows:
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is at least 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- `substr` is a string of length 3 equal to `s[1:4]`.

The provided code is:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```
Before executing this line, we need to know the initial value of `max_len`. However, since it's not provided in the initial state, we'll assume `max_len` is already defined with some value.

Now, let's calculate the result:
- The value of `substr` is a string of length 3.
- The `len(substr)` will always be 3 because `substr` is defined as a string of length 3 equal to `s[1:4]`.
- The `max` function compares the current value of `max_len` with the length of `substr` (which is 3) and assigns the maximum of these two values back to `max_len`.
- The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `substr`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is at least 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- `substr` is a string of length 3 equal to `s[1:4]`.
- `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 3.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `substr` is a string of length 3 equal to `s[1:4]`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 3**
