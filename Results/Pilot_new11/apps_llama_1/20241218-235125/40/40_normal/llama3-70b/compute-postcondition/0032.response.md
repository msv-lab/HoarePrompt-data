To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the provided information and the loop code.

The loop code iterates over a range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, where `i` is initially 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1. For each iteration, it checks if the substring `s[i:j]` is a palindrome. If it's not, it updates `max_len` with the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found so far.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

- `s` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.
- `n` must be at least `j` for the loop to execute `j - i` times, indicating that `n` should be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus `i`.
- `i` remains 1 throughout the loop as it's not updated within the loop.
- `j` increments by 1 in each iteration, ranging from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
- `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to `j`, and its length increases by 1 in each iteration.
- `max_len` is updated with the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings found so far. If all substrings are palindromes, `max_len` remains 0.

Considering these patterns, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `s` will remain the same as it was initially, a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, which does not change.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` will have reached `n + 1` after the last iteration, but since we are looking at the state after all iterations, `j`'s final value is not directly relevant to the output state.
- `max_len` will be the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 1 and ending at any index up to `n`, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 1 and ending at any index up to `n`, or 0 if all such substrings are palindromes.**
