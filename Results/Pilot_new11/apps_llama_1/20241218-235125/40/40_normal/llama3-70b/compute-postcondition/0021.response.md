Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s` starting at index 0 and ending at any index up to `n - 1`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes, `j` is 2, and `substr` is `s[1:2]`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, meaning `substr` is not a palindrome.**
