The code updates the value of `max_len` by comparing its current value with the length of `substr` and assigning the maximum of these two values to `max_len`. Since `substr` is `s[1:2]`, its length is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `j` is 2, and `substr` is `s[1:2]`, and `substr` is not a palindrome**
