The value of `left` is decremented by 1. 
The initial value of `left` is `mid - 2`. 
So, the new value of `left` becomes `(mid - 2) - 1` which simplifies to `mid - 3`.
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid - 3`, with the understanding that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid - 3`.**
