Based on the provided information and the loop code, let's analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

The loop code increments `right` as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. The loop will stop executing when `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

From the output state after the loop executes some number of times, we can see that `right` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop will execute at least once if `func_1(mid + 1)` equals `m`.

Since the loop stops when `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, the final value of `right` will be the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

Other variables such as `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `result`, and `left` do not change within the loop, so their final values will be the same as their initial values.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right` is the first value greater than the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the original value of `m`, `m` remains the same, `low` remains the same, `high` remains the same, `mid` remains the same, `zeroes` remains the same, `result` remains an empty list, `left` remains the first value less than or equal to the original value of `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal the original value of `m`**
