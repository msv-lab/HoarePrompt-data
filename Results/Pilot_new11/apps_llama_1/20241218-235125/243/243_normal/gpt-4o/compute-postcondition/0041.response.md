The value of `left` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`m` is still a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is still `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must still equal `m`, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`, and `result` is still an empty list `[]`. 
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`**
