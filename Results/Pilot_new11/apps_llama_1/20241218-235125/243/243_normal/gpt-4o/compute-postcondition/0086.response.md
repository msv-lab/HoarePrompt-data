Output State: **The program returns 'result' which is either an empty list if no 'mid' satisfies 'func_1(mid) == m', or a list of integers from 'left + 1' to 'right - 1' where 'left' and 'right' are the boundaries for which 'func_1(x)' equals 'm', with 'left' being the first value less than 'mid' for which 'func_1(left)' does not equal 'm', and 'right' being the first value greater than 'mid' for which 'func_1(right)' does not equal 'm'**
