The code `zeroes = func_1(mid)` assigns the result of `func_1(mid)` to the variable `zeroes`. The initial state of `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, and `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`. The value of `low` is less than or equal to `high`. 

Since `func_1` is not defined, we assume it is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a value. The exact nature of this function is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroes`. However, we can say that `zeroes` is now equal to the result of `func_1(mid)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`**
