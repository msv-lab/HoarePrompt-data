Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`, with `result` being an empty list. If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, then either `low` remains `0` and `high` is updated to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1` if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, or `low` remains `0`, `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`, and `result` becomes a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `zeroes` equals `m`, with `left` being the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` being the smallest value greater than `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.***
