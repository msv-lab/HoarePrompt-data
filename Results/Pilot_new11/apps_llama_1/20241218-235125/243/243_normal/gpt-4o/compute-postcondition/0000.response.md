To find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, we need to consider how trailing zeroes are formed in a factorial. A trailing zero is created by a pair of 2 and 5 since 2 * 5 = 10. In any factorial, the number of 2s will far exceed the number of 5s because every other number has a factor of 2, and every 4th number has an additional factor of 2, etc., whereas only every 5th number has a factor of 5. Thus, the limiting factor for the number of trailing zeroes will be the number of 5s in the prime factorization of `n!`.

The number of trailing zeroes in `n!`, which is the number of factors of 5 in `n!`, can be calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{Trailing Zeroes} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots \]
until the quotient is less than 5.

Given that `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, and we are looking for `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, we are essentially looking for an `n` that satisfies the equation above with the result equal to `m`. However, without a specific value of `m`, we cannot directly solve for `n` because the relationship between `m` and `n` is not straightforward due to the floor functions and the varying powers of 5.

For any given `m`, to find an `n` that satisfies the condition, we would start by trying to solve the equation for the smallest terms first and then adjusting `n` until the condition is met. The condition given does not directly lead to a simple algebraic solution for `n` in terms of `m` but rather suggests a process of testing values of `n` to see which ones produce a factorial with `m` trailing zeroes.

Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100,000, and without a specific algorithm provided to compute `n` directly from `m`, the output state reflects the initial condition and the goal:
m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000, and we are seeking n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeroes.

Output State: **m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000, and we are seeking n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeroes.**
