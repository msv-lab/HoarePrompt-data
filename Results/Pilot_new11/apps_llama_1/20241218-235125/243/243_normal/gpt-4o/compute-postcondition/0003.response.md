According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`. Given that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `high` will always be greater than `low`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `low` and `high` for the loop to execute one more time. The state of `m` being a positive integer and the other variables can remain as they are because they do not affect the condition of the while loop directly in a way that would prevent its execution.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list**
