To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is unchanged
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`
- `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`
- `low` and `high` are unchanged
- `result` is an empty list `[]`
- `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`
- `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 2`

The loop condition depends on the value of `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`.

Since `right` is defined as `(low + high) // 2 + 2`, and we want `func_1(right)` to equal `m`, we don't necessarily need to adjust `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, or `result` as their current states do not directly impact the condition of the loop for the next iteration.

However, given that `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 2`, for `func_1(right)` to equal `m`, it implies that the values of `func_1` for any `x` where `left < x <= right` should equal `m` to ensure the loop condition can be met again, especially considering `right`'s definition and the requirement for the loop to continue.

But since `right` is specifically defined and its relation to `m` through `func_1(right)` is the critical condition, and we have no information suggesting `func_1`'s behavior changes based on the other variables' states directly in a way that would affect the loop condition, the focus remains on ensuring `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed for certain execution of the next loop iteration would be ensuring `func_1(right)` equals `m`, which is implicitly covered by the condition that needs to be met for the loop to continue. The given states of other variables (`m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `left`) do not require adjustment based on the information provided and the loop condition.

State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 2` and `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
