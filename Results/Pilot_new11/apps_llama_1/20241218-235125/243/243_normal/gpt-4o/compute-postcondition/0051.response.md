The code increases the value of `right` by 1. The value of `right` was initially `(low + high) // 2 + 2`. After the increment operation, `right` becomes `(low + high) // 2 + 3`. 

The values of `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, `result`, and `left` are unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 3`**
