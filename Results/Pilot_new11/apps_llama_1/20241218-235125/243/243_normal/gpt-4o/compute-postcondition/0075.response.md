To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program. The given code is `right += 1`. This means we are incrementing the value of `right` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.
- `right` is `mid + 1` and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`.

After executing `right += 1`, the value of `right` becomes `mid + 2`. This is because `right` was initially `mid + 1`, and we are incrementing it by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`.
- `right` is `mid + 2`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 2`.**
