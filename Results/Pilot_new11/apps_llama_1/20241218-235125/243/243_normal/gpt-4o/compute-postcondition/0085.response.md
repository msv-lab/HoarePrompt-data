To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have executed, let's break down the loop's behavior based on the conditions provided and the updates of variables `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `result`.

1. **Initial State**: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, and `result` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `low <= high`. In each iteration, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.

3. **Update Conditions**:
   - If `zeroes < m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - If `zeroes > m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - If `zeroes == m`, then a range of values from `left + 1` to `right - 1` is calculated and stored in `result`, where `left` is the largest value less than `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the smallest value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. The loop then breaks.

4. **Termination Conditions**: The loop terminates when `low > high` or when `zeroes == m` and the `result` list has been populated.

Considering these steps and conditions, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be described as follows:

- `low` will be greater than `high` if no value of `mid` satisfies `func_1(mid) == m`, indicating that the loop searched through all possible values without finding a match.
- `result` will be populated with a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` if at least one value of `mid` satisfies `func_1(mid) == m`, where `left` and `right` are defined as above.
- `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is used as a constant target value for `func_1(mid)`.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, or `low` and `high` are unchanged if `func_1(mid)` equals `m` and the loop breaks, `m` is unchanged, and `result` is either an empty list if no `mid` satisfies `func_1(mid) == m`, or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` and `right` are the boundaries for which `func_1(x)` equals `m`, with `left` being the first value less than `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` being the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.**
