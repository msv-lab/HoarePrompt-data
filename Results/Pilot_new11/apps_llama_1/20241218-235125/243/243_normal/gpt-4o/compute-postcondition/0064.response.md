The given code initializes an empty list `result`. This operation does not affect the values of `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, or `zeroes`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, and `result` is an empty list**
