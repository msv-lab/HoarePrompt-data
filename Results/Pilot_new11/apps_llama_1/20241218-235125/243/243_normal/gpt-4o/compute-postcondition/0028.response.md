To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. This implies that the loop will stop when `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`.
2. Within the loop, the only variable that changes is `right`, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
3. The output state after the loop executes some number of times shows that `right` increases by the number of iterations. For example, after 1 iteration, `right` becomes `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 2`, indicating an increment of 1 from its initial value of `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1`.

Given this pattern, the loop will continue to increment `right` until `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`. Once this condition is met, the loop will terminate.

Considering the initial state and the changes that occur within the loop, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed will be:

- `m` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `low` remains 0.
- `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`.
- `result` remains an empty list, as there are no operations in the loop that modify it.
- `mid` remains `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, unchanged.
- `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, as it does not change.
- `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and this does not change within the loop provided.
- `right` will be the smallest value greater than its initial value for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, since the loop increments `right` until this condition is met.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the smallest value greater than `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`**
