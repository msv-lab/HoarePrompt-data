To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`

And the code:
```python
left = mid
```

This line of code assigns the value of `mid` to a new variable named `left`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`.

The impact of this code is the introduction of a new variable `left` with the value of `mid`, which is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, `zeroes`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`
- `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `left` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`**
