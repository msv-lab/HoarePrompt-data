The given code is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. Given the initial state, we know the values of `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `left`, and `right` before the `break` statement is executed.

Since `break` does not modify any variable, the values of `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. The only effect of `break` here is to terminate the execution of the loop or conditional statement it is part of.

Therefore, after executing the `break` statement, the state of the variables remains the same as before the execution, with the addition that we exit the most internal loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the first value greater than the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
