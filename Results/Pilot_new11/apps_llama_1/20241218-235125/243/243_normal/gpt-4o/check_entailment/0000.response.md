Correctness: **True**.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (factorial of `n`), and `func_2` uses `func_1` to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

`func_1` works by counting the number of factors of 5 in `n!`, since a trailing zero is created by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5. It does this by dividing `n` by increasing powers of 5 and summing up the results.

`func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the range of numbers `n` that satisfy the condition. It starts by initializing a range `[low, high]` and then performs a binary search to find a number `mid` such that `mid!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Once it finds such a number, it expands around it to find all numbers in the range that satisfy the condition.

The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `m` is 0, the program will return an empty list, which is correct since `0!` has no trailing zeroes. If `m` is a large number, the program will return an empty list, which is also correct since there is a limit to the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

The program also handles the case where there are multiple numbers `n` that satisfy the condition. For example, if `m` is 1, the program will return the list `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, which is correct since `5!`, `6!`, `7!`, `8!`, and `9!` all have exactly one trailing zero.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and handles all potential cases. It correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` and finds all numbers `n` that satisfy the condition.
