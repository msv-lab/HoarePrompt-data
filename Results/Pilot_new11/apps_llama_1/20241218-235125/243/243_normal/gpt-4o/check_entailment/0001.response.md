Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct. It consists of two functions: `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (the factorial of `n`), and `func_2` finds all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

`func_1` uses the fact that trailing zeroes in `n!` are created by factors of 5 and 2, and since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, it only counts the factors of 5. It does this by repeatedly dividing `n` by powers of 5 and summing up the results.

`func_2` uses a binary search to find the range of `n` values that result in `n!` having exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Once it finds a value of `n` that results in `m` trailing zeroes, it expands outwards to find all `n` values that result in `m` trailing zeroes.

The code handles all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.
- It correctly finds all `n` values such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
- It handles the edge case where there are no `n` values that result in `m` trailing zeroes (in which case it returns an empty list).

The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code.

Overall, the provided Python program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
