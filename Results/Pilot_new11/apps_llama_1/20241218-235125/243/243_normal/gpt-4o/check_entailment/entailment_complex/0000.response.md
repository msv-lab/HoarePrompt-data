Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a solution to the problem of finding the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. 

Function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of n. This function is based on the fact that the number of trailing zeroes in n! is determined by the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of all numbers from 1 to n. 

Function `func_2(m)` finds all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes. It uses a binary search approach to find a number mid for which `func_1(mid)` equals m, then expands around mid to find the range of values for which `func_1(n)` equals m.

The problem description provides examples, such as when the input is 1, the output should be 5 5 6 7 8 9, and when the input is 5, the output should be 0. 

The code handles these examples correctly. 

Also, according to the annotations in the code, `func_1(n)` handles all positive integer inputs, and `func_2(m)` handles edge cases where no such range exists by returning an empty list.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number and finds all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes. 

The binary search approach in `func_2(m)` efficiently finds the range of values for which `func_1(n)` equals m. 

Overall, the code is correct, and it follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
