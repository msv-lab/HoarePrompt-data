Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem asks for the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes, where `m` is the input. However, the provided program does not accurately calculate this.

The issue lies in the way the program attempts to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`. The program uses the formula `n // 5 ** count` to calculate the number of trailing zeroes, but this is not the correct formula. The correct formula to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` is based on the number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to `n`, because a trailing zero is formed by a pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of the factorial, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of each `n` and checking if this number equals `m`. However, the provided program does not do this correctly. It instead increments `count` until `n // 5 ** count >= m`, which does not accurately represent the calculation of trailing zeroes in factorials.

Furthermore, the second loop of the program appends `n` to the answer list if `n // 5 ** count < m`, which is also incorrect based on the logic provided. This condition does not correctly check for the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to implement a loop that calculates the number of factors of 5 in each factorial from `n=1` onwards until it finds all `n` where the number of factors of 5 (and thus the number of trailing zeroes) equals `m`. 

Here's a simple example of how the correct function might start:

```python
def count_trailing_zeroes(n):
    count = 0
    i = 5
    while n // i >= 1:
        count += n // i
        i *= 5
    return count

def func():
    m = int(input())
    solutions = [n for n in range(1, m*5 + 1) if count_trailing_zeroes(n) == m]
    print(len(solutions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, solutions)))
```

This corrected version calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of each `n` by counting the factors of 5 (using the `count_trailing_zeroes` function) and checks if this count equals `m`. If it does, `n` is added to the list of solutions. The function then prints the length of this list (the number of solutions) followed by the solutions themselves.
