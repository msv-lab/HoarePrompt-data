Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It attempts to find the values of n for which the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes, but it does not accurately calculate these values.

The issue lies in the logic used to determine the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number. The number of trailing zeroes in n! is determined by the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of all numbers up to n. The program does not correctly calculate this.

A correct approach would be to calculate the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of all numbers up to n, and then compare this to the given value of m. 

For example, if m = 1, the correct output should be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, but the given program does not produce this output for all possible inputs. 

Here is an example of how the program fails:
Input: 3
The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly calculate the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number.

A correct solution would involve calculating the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of all numbers up to n, and then comparing this to the given value of m. This can be done using a loop to calculate the number of factors of 5, 25, 125, etc. in the prime factorization of all numbers up to n.

Here's a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def find_factorial_zeroes(m):
    count = 0
    result = []
    i = 1
    while True:
        num_factors = 0
        n = i
        while n >= 5:
            num_factors += n // 5
            n //= 5
        if num_factors == m:
            result.append(i)
            count += 1
        elif num_factors > m:
            break
        i += 1
    print(count)
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

m = int(input())
find_factorial_zeroes(m)
```
This program correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number and outputs the correct result.
