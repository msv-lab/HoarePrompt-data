The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it is designed to find the smallest positive integer `n` such that the factorial of `n` has a specified number of trailing zeroes `m`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive). The function will return the value of `n`.


Functionality: **The function returns the smallest positive integer n such that the factorial of n has m trailing zeroes, where m is between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive).**
