Postcondition: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 100,000, `m` represents the required number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a positive integer `n`, initially `n` was 1, and the current value of `n` is such that, `count` is 0, and `n` divided by 5 to the power of `count` is greater than or equal to `m`.**
