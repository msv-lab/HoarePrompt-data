Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately compares the two numbers represented in different bases and prints the correct result. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the input correctly: it reads the number of digits `n` and the base `bx` for the first number `X`, the digits of `X`, the number of digits `m` and the base `by` for the second number `Y`, and the digits of `Y`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

2. The function `func_1` correctly converts the digits of a number from any base between 2 and 40 to decimal. It does this by iterating over the digits from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This is a standard algorithm for converting numbers from any base to decimal.

3. The program uses the function `func_1` to convert both numbers `X` and `Y` to decimal, which allows for a correct comparison.

4. The program compares the decimal values of `X` and `Y` and prints the correct result: `<` if `X` is less than `Y`, `>` if `X` is greater than `Y`, and `=` if `X` is equal to `Y`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Since the program correctly reads the input, converts the numbers to decimal, compares them, and prints the result, it follows the problem description and is therefore correct.
