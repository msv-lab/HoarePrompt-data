The original assessment that the program is correct makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code correctly reads the input digits and bases for both numbers, converts them to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values to determine the correct comparison result.

The `func_1` function works by iterating over the input digits from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This is a standard method for converting a number from a given base to decimal.

The output hints confirm that the `func_1` function is working correctly and that the program is handling valid inputs as expected. The hints also mention that the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty input lists or invalid input types, but since we assume the input will always be valid, this is not a concern.

The program's logic is straightforward, and the code is well-structured and easy to follow. The original assessment correctly points out that the program assumes well-formed inputs and does not include error checking or handling for invalid inputs. However, since we are assuming valid inputs, this is not a problem.

Overall, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the program is correct and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
