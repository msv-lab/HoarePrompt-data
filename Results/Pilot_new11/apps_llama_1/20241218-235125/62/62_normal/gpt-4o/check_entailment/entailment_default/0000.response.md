Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts a number represented as a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. The main part of the program uses this function to convert both numbers to decimal and then compares them, which is the main task of the problem description. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to check if the base is between 2 and 40 or if the digits are valid for the given base. The program description provides examples that suggest the code should work correctly for different cases, including different bases and numbers with different numbers of digits. 

The function `func_1` correctly handles all potential edge cases, including the conversion of numbers with leading zeros and the handling of empty input lists, but as stated in the problem description we assume the input is valid and will not cause any errors, so these edge cases are not relevant here.

Therefore, the code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case and thus the Correctness is **True**.
