Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It accepts the number of digits and base for two numbers X and Y, then converts each number from its respective base to decimal using the `func_1` function. Finally, it compares the decimal values of X and Y and outputs the correct comparison operator ('<', '>', or '=').

The `func_1` function correctly handles the conversion of a number from any base between 2 and 40 to decimal, and it handles edge cases such as leading zeros and empty input lists.

The code also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description:

* For the first example, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 and Y = 47_10, so the output is '='.
* For the second example, X = 102_3 = 11_10 and Y = 24_5 = 14_10, so the output is '<'.
* For the third example, X = FF4007A_16 and Y = 4803150_9, and the decimal values are correctly calculated and compared, resulting in the output '>'.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, including the provided examples, the correctness is True.
