According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1, and `decimal_value` is 0. For the loop to execute, `digits` must have at least 1 digit and `digit` is the first digit in the list.
State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1, `decimal_value` is 0, `digit` is the first digit in the list**
