Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `i` is an index in `s` that corresponds to the last character of `s`, the last character of `s` is not ']', and the character at index `i` of `s` is ':', `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s`, or -1 if no such ':' is found. Since `f` is initially `False`, the if condition will not be met, and the program will not execute the if block. Hence, `bind` remains -1 and `f` remains `False`.***
