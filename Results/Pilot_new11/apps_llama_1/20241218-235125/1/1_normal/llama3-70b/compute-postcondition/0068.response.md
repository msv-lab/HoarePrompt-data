Postcondition: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s` and `ind` must be less than `bind - 1`, `bind` is the index of the ':' character and `bind` must be greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `ind + 1`, `f` is `True`, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '|', then `ans` is 5, otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged as 4.**
