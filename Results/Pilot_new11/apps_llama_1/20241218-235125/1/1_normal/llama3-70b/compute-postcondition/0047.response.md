Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, if the last character of `s` is ']', then `f` is `True` and `bind` is `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `f` remains `False` and `bind` is -1***
