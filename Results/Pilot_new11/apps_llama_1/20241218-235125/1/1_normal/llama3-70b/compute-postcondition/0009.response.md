Postcondition: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `ind` is -1, the current value of `f` is True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` was not '[' and the character at index `i` of string `s` was ':' but since `f` is now True, the current value of the character at index `i` of string `s` is ':'**
