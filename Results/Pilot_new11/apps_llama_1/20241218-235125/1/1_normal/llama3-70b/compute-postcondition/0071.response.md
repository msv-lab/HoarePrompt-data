Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s` and `ind` must be less than `bind - 2`, `bind` is the index of the ':' character and `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`, `i` is `ind + 2`, `f` is `True`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '|', then if the character at index `i - 1` in `s` is '|', `ans` is 6, otherwise, `ans` is 5. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '|', then if the character at index `i - 1` in `s` is '|', `ans` is 5, otherwise, `ans` remains 4.***
