Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `i` is an index in `s` that corresponds to the last character of `s`, the last character of `s` is not ']', `f` remains `False`, and `bind` remains -1, regardless of whether the character at index `i` of `s` is ':' or not, since the if condition will not be met due to `f` being initially `False`.***
