The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. Given that `i` is 2, `ind` will be assigned the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2 where 2 < `n` â‰¤ 500000, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2**
