Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2 where 2 < `n` â‰¤ 500000, `i` is 2. If `s` at index `i` is '[', then `f` is `True`. If `s` at index `i` is ':', then `ind` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. For all other cases of `s` at index `i`, the state remains unchanged.***
