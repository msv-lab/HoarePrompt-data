The value of `start_colon` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is `ind + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 1`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 1`, `start_colon` is `i` which equals `ind + 1**
