Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, if `s[i-1]` is '[', then `ind` is equal to the new value of `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `ind` remains unchanged**
