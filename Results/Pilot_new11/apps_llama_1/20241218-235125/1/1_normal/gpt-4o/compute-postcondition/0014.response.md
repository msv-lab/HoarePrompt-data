The code snippet is a `break` statement, which means we exit the loop or conditional statement we are currently in. This statement does not change the values of any variables, but it does change the control flow of the program.


Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `ind` is equal to the value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
