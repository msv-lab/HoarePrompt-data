To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program. The given code is `ind = i`. This means we are assigning the value of `i` to `ind`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- If `s[i]` is '[', then `ind` is 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of `ind` and `i` remains as initially described in the precondition.

When `ind = i` is executed:
- The value of `ind` is updated to be equal to `i`.
- The values of `s`, `n` are not changed by this operation.
- The condition regarding `n` being greater than 1 and its relation to `len(s)` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state after executing `ind = i` is:
- `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, and `n` is greater than 1.
- `ind` is equal to `i`.
- If `s[i]` is '[', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `n` is greater than 1, `ind` is equal to `i`, and if `s[i]` is '[', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
