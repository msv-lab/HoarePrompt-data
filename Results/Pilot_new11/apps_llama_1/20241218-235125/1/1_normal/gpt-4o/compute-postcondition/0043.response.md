The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, `i`, and `start_colon` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `i` is `ind + 1`, `start_colon` is `i` which equals `ind + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
