The value of `bind` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is `n - 3`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 500000 and equal to `len(s)`, so `i` is between -2 and 499997. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is either -1 if no '[' is found in `s` or the index of the first '[' in `s` otherwise, `i` is `n - 3`, `bind` is `n - 3`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is either -1 if no '[' is found in `s` or the index of the first '[' in `s` otherwise, `i` is `n - 3`, `bind` is `n - 3`**
