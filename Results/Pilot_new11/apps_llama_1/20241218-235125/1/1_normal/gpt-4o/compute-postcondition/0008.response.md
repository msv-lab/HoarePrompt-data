According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 and equal to `len(s)`, and `n` is between 1 and 500000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. Since `n` must be greater than `i`, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `n` is greater than 1, if `s[i]` is '[', then `ind` is 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of `ind` and `i` remains as initially described in the precondition**
