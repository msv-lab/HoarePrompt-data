The value of `pipe_count` is incremented by 1. If `s[i-1]` equals `|`, then the previous value of `pipe_count` was 1, so the new value of `pipe_count` is 2. If `s[i-1]` does not equal `|`, then the previous state of `pipe_count` was unchanged, so the new value of `pipe_count` is the previous value of `pipe_count` plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with at least one `[` and one `]`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last `]` in `s`, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `start_colon` and `end_colon` are indices of `:` characters between `[` and `]` in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to `start_colon + 2` and is the current index in the loop, if `s[i-1]` equals `|`, then `pipe_count` is 2, otherwise `pipe_count` is the previous value of `pipe_count` plus 1**
