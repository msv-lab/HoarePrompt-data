To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given loop statement and the conditions provided.

Given loop statement:
```python
for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
The loop iterates from `bind - 1` down to `ind` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`, meaning `i` decreases by `1` in each iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with at least one `[` and one `]`.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`.
- `ind` is the index of the first `[` in `s` and is not `-1`.
- `bind` is the index of the last `]` in `s` and is not `-1`.
- `ind` is less than `bind - 2`.
- `i` is `bind - 2`.
- If `s[i]` equals `:`, then `end_colon` is `bind - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `end_colon` remains as previously determined.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `i` decreases by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `bind - 3`.
- The conditions related to `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `bind` do not change because they are not modified by the loop iteration itself but are rather conditions that must hold true for the loop to be meaningful.
- The condition regarding `end_colon` depends on the value of `s[i]`, but since we're considering the state adjustment for the next iteration without executing the loop body, we don't have new information to update `end_colon` directly from the given state. However, if `s[i]` (where `i` is the new value, `bind - 3`) equals `:`, then `end_colon` would be updated to `bind - 3` according to the problem statement, but this is speculative without knowing the exact content of `s`.

Thus, focusing strictly on the adjustments that can be deduced without additional context:
- `i` must decrease by `1`, so it becomes `bind - 3`.
- Other conditions remain as they are, awaiting the outcome of the loop body execution to potentially update `end_colon` or to break out of the loop.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind - 3`, `i` is `bind - 3`**
