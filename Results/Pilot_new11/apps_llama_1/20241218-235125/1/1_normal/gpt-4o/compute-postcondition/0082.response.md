Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1. If `start_colon` is -1, or `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, then the value -1 has been printed to the console and `i` is equal to `ind`. Otherwise, `start_colon` and `end_colon` are indices of ':' characters between '[' and ']' in `s`, `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, `i` is equal to `end_colon`, and the value `4 + pipe_count` has been returned, where `pipe_count` is the total number of '|' characters between `start_colon` and `end_colon` in `s`.**
