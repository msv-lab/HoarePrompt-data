To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the conditions at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1)`. This means the loop iterates from `bind - 1` down to `ind` (excluding `ind` because the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value), decrementing by 1 each time.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string with specific characteristics.
- `n` equals `len(s)`.
- `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s`.
- `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s`.
- `ind` is less than `bind - 1`.
- `start_colon` might be the index of the first ':' between the first '[' and the last ']', or -1 if no such ':' exists.
- `i` could be equal to `bind - 1` under certain conditions, and `end_colon` could be updated based on the presence of a ':' at `bind - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider how the loop's counter `i` is updated and what conditions must hold for the loop to continue.

1. **Loop Counter (`i`)**: At the end of the previous iteration, if `i` was `bind - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1 because of the `-1` step in the `range` function. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `bind - 2`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Continuation**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than `ind` because the loop iterates from `bind - 1` down to `ind`. So, after the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be greater than `ind`.

3. **Other State Variables**: The values of `s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, `start_colon`, and `end_colon` do not directly influence whether the loop executes one more time, based on the given loop statement. However, their values might change within the loop body based on the omitted logic.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time would be:

- `s` remains the same string.
- `n` remains equal to `len(s)`.
- `ind` remains the index of the first '[' in `s`.
- `bind` remains the index of the last ']' in `s`.
- `i` must be decremented by 1 from its previous value, so if it was `bind - 1`, it becomes `bind - 2`.
- `start_colon` and `end_colon` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless changed by the loop body, which is not detailed.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind - 2`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character between the first '[' and the last ']' if it exists, otherwise -1, `end_colon` is either -1 or the index of the last ':' before `i`, depending on the previous iteration's logic**
