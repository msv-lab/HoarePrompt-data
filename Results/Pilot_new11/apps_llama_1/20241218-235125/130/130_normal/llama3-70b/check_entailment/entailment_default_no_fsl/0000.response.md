Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The condition `M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L` is not sufficient to guarantee that the three terms of the problem are met.

The first term states that everyone must gift as many coins as others. This means that if one friend gifts a coin, all other friends must gift a coin as well.

The second term states that all coins given to Ivan must be different. This means that even if a friend gifts a coin, they cannot gift the same coin again.

The third term states that not less than L coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection. This means that the total number of new coins gifted must be at least L.

The code does not correctly check these conditions. For example, it does not check if the total number of new coins gifted is at least L when each friend gifts one coin.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when N = 10, M = 5, K = 8, and L = 7. In this case, the program would print 1, indicating that one coin from each friend is enough. However, this would not meet the condition that not less than L coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection, since 5 coins would be gifted in total (one from each friend) and not all of them would be new to Ivan's collection. 

In this case, we need to find the minimum number of coins that each friend can gift so that the total number of coins gifted is at least L, and all coins gifted are different. The correct answer for this case would be the minimum number of coins each friend can gift such that the total number of coins gifted is at least L and all coins gifted are different. 

For example, if each friend gifts 2 coins, then a total of 10 coins would be gifted, and since there are only 10 different coins, it is possible that all coins gifted are different, and not less than L coins from gifts altogether would be new in Ivan's collection.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
