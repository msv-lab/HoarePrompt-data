The code prints -1. The values of N, M, K, and L are not changed by this operation. 
The output of the code is -1, and this value has been returned at the output state. 
The condition that either M is less than N - K + 1 or M is less than L is still valid. 
Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, K, and L are input integers, where the values of N, M, K, and L are the input integers, and either M is less than N - K + 1 or M is less than L, and the value -1 has been returned and printed.
Output State: **N, M, K, and L are input integers, where the values of N, M, K, and L are the input integers, and either M is less than N - K + 1 or M is less than L, and the value -1 has been returned and printed.**
