The given code is a simple print statement that prints the value 1. This statement does not affect the values of the variables N, M, K, and L. 

The value of M is still greater than or equal to the result of subtracting K from N and adding 1 (N - K + 1), and the value of M is also greater than or equal to L.

The output of the print statement is 1, but this does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **N, M, K, and L are input integers, where M is greater than or equal to N - K + 1 and M is greater than or equal to L, and 1 has been printed.**
