Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description and correctly determines the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to satisfy all the conditions.

Here's why it works:

1. The minimum number of coins that each friend must gift is determined by the formula `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M`. This is because Ivan must receive at least `L` new coins, and each friend must gift the same number of coins. By dividing `L` by `M` and rounding up to the nearest whole number, we ensure that Ivan will receive at least `L` new coins.

2. The program then checks if `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`. This is because the total number of coins gifted must be less than or equal to the number of coins that Ivan does not already have. If this condition is met, then it is possible to satisfy all the conditions, and the program prints `min_x`.

3. If `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`, then it is not possible to satisfy all the conditions. This is because the total number of coins gifted would exceed the number of coins that Ivan does not already have. In this case, the program prints `-1`.

The program correctly handles all cases, including the edge cases where `M` or `L` is 1. It also correctly determines the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift, taking into account the number of coins that Ivan already has and the minimum number of new coins that Ivan must receive.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description, and it produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
