Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to Ivan to satisfy the problem conditions. 

The program first calculates the minimum number of coins `min_x` that each friend must gift such that the total number of new coins is at least `L`. This is done using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is the ceiling of `L / M`.

Then, it checks if it is possible for each friend to gift `min_x` different coins. If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, it means that each friend can gift `min_x` different coins without exceeding the total number of coins `N` or the number of coins that Ivan does not have (`N - K`). In this case, the program prints `min_x`.

If `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`, it means that it is not possible for each friend to gift `min_x` different coins without exceeding the total number of coins or the number of coins that Ivan does not have. In this case, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to satisfy the problem conditions.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including when `N` is equal to `K`, when `M` is equal to `1`, and when `L` is equal to `0`. It also correctly handles the cases when the input values are at their minimum or maximum allowed values.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible edge cases correctly.
