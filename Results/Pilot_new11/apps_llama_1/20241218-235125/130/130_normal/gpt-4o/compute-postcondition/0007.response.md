Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer, the total number of different collectible coins, `M` is an integer, the number of friends, `K` is an integer, the number of coins Ivan already has, `L` is an integer, the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive, `min_x` is an integer equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`. If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to the difference between `N` and `K`, then the value of `min_x` has been printed. Otherwise, the product of `M` and `min_x` is greater than `N - K`, and the value -1 has been returned.***
