The code snippet provided only includes a print statement, which does not modify any variables. It simply outputs the value 1 to the console. 

The initial state provides relationships between `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`: the sum of `cnt_1` and `cnt_2` equals the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4`, and `cnt_2` is greater than or equal to `cnt_3`. Since the code does not alter any of these variables or their relationships, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the additional note that the value 1 has been printed.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is an input integer, the sum of `cnt_1` and `cnt_2` equals the sum of `cnt_3` and `cnt_4`, `cnt_2` is greater than or equal to `cnt_3`, and the value 1 has been printed.**
