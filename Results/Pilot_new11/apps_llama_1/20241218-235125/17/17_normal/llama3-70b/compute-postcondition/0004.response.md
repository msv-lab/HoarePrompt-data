The code `print(1)` simply prints the value 1 to the console. It does not modify any variables.

Output State: **`cnt1` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt2` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt3` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt4` is a non-negative integer input, `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, and the value 1 has been printed to the console.**
