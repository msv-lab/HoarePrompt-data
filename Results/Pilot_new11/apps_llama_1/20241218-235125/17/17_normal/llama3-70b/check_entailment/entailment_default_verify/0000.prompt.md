You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1
4
3

Output
1

Input
0
0
0
0

Output
1

Input
1
2
3
4

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt3 > cnt1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The condition `if cnt3 > cnt1` is not sufficient to determine whether a regular bracket sequence can be formed. 

A correct condition would be `if cnt3 + cnt4 > cnt1 + cnt2 + 1` or `if cnt1 > cnt3 + cnt4 + 1` and `(cnt1 - cnt3 - cnt4) % 2 == cnt2` when `cnt1 >= cnt3 + cnt4`. When `cnt1 < cnt3 + cnt4`, we should also check `cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4 - cnt1` to ensure that every opening bracket can be matched. Otherwise, the program should print `0`.

A counterexample for the given program is when `cnt1 = 1`, `cnt2 = 3`, `cnt3 = 0`, `cnt4 = 0`. In this case, the program will print `1`, but the correct output should be `0` because it's impossible to form a regular bracket sequence with these strings. 

Here's a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 > cnt3 + cnt4:
        print(1 if (cnt1 - cnt3 - cnt4) % 2 == cnt2 else 0)
    elif cnt1 < cnt3 + cnt4:
        print(1 if cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4 - cnt1 else 0)
    else:
        print(1 if cnt2 >= 1 or cnt2 == 0 and cnt3 + cnt4 == 0 else 0)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four non-negative integers from the input, representing the counts of different string types, and prints 0 if the count of the third type is greater than the count of the first type; otherwise, it prints 1. The function does not perform any validation on the input values beyond assuming they are non-negative integers, and it does not utilize the counts of the second and fourth string types. The final state of the program after execution is that one of two values (0 or 1) has been printed to the console based on the comparison between the first and third input counts, and the input values are stored in variables within the function's scope but are not returned or further processed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
