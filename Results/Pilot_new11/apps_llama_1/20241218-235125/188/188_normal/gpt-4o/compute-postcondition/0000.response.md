The input is a sequence of n integers, where n is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be the input integer. Since the input is a sequence of n integers and `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is now equal to the number of integers in the input sequence, which is the input even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). 

Output State: **The input is a sequence of n integers, where n is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `n` is the input even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive)**
