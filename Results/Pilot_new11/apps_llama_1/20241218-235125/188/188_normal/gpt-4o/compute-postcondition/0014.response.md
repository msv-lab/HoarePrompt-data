Unfortunately, the problem description seems to be incomplete, as it does not specify the output of the function or any specific conditions that affect the return value. However, I will provide an answer based on the provided information.


The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, according to the problem description, the input is a sequence of n integers, where n is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The functionality description should ideally include the relationship between this input sequence and the function's return value.


Given the lack of specific details about the output, I will provide a general description based on typical functions that operate on sequences of integers.


Functionality: **The function accepts a sequence of n integers as input, where n is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and returns a value based on this input sequence.**
