Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It reads the input sequence of n integers, where n is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
2. It counts the frequency of each integer in the sequence using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
3. It sorts the unique integers in ascending order of their frequencies using the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key.
4. It checks if the number of unique integers in the sequence is less than 2. If so, it immediately prints 'NO' because the game cannot be fair with less than 2 unique integers.
5. If there are 2 or more unique integers, it checks if the frequency of the most frequent integer and the second most frequent integer is equal to n // 2. If so, it prints 'YES' along with the two integers that make up the groups.
6. If the frequency of the most frequent integer and the second most frequent integer is not equal to n // 2, it prints 'NO' because the game cannot be fair in this case.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement:

* If the input sequence contains less than 2 unique integers, it prints 'NO'.
* If the input sequence contains 2 or more unique integers, it checks if the frequency of the most frequent integer and the second most frequent integer is equal to n // 2 and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
* The program assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors, as stated in the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases as required.
