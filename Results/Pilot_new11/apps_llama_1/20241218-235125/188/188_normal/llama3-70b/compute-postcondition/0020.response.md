To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` input integers with the second element as the new `i`.
- `d` is a dictionary where the previous `i` has its value incremented by 1, and for the new `i` (which is `a[1]`), if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `d[i]` equals 1.

The loop statement is `for i in a:`. This means that `i` will take the value of each element in `a` one by one.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `a[1]` (the second element of `a`), because it's mentioned that the second element of `a` is the new `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to move to the next element in `a`.

So, for the next iteration:
- `n` remains the same since it's the length of `a` and doesn't change within the loop.
- `a` doesn't change; it's still a list of `n` input integers.
- `i` needs to be the next element in `a` after `a[1]`, which would be `a[2]`.
- For `d`, since `i` is now `a[2]`, if `a[2]` was already a key in `d`, its value should be incremented by 1; otherwise, `d[a[2]]` should be set to 1, indicating this is the first occurrence of `a[2]`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `i` is the third element of `a` (`a[2]`), and `d` is updated such that if `a[2]` was a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `d[a[2]]` equals 1**
