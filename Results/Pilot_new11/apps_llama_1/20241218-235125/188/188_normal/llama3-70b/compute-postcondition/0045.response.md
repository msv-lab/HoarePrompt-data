The code assigns the value of `i` to `a1`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers with at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, and `i` is the next key in `d` after the current one.

Given this, `a1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is the next key in `d`. The states of `n`, `a`, and `d` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d` after the current one, and `a1` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d` after the current one, and `a1` is equal to `i`.**
