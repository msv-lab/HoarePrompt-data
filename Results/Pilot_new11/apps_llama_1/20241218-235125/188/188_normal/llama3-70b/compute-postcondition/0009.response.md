The code snippet creates a new empty dictionary `d`. This does not modify the existing variables `n`, `a`, or `i`.

The value of `n` remains a non-negative integer. 
The list `a` remains a list of `n` input integers and is unchanged.
The value of `i` remains `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` remains undefined if `n` is 0.
A new variable `d` is introduced and is assigned an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0 and is undefined if `n` is 0, `d` is an empty dictionary**
