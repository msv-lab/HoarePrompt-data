The code assigns the value of `i` to a new variable `a2`. The previous values of the variables are: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, and `i` is the next key in `d`.

The states of the variables `n`, `a`, `d`, and `i` are not affected. However, a new variable `a2` is introduced and is assigned the value of `i`, which is the next key in `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d`, and `a2` is equal to `i`**
