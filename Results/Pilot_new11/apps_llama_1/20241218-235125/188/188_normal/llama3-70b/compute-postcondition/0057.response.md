Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is either -1 or the first integer with a count of `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or the second integer with a count of `n // 2`. If both `a1` and `a2` are not -1, 'YES' has been printed to the console along with the values of `a1` and `a2`. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console.***
