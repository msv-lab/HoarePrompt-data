Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the following case:

Input:
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

In this case, the program will print 'NO' which is correct, but the reason is not handled correctly in the program. The program only checks for the cases where two distinct numbers appear exactly n/2 times. However, it should also check for cases where more than two numbers can be chosen such that the total number of cards with those numbers is equal to n/2. 

For example, in this case, if we choose the number 1 and 2, we get two cards each, and if we choose the number 3, we can't get two cards with the remaining number. But the program does not handle such cases.

However, the main issue is that the program only checks for the first pair of numbers that appear exactly n/2 times, and it doesn't check if there are any other pairs. But more importantly, the program doesn't check if the numbers that appear n/2 times are distinct, which is not sufficient for a correct solution. 

But more specifically this program does not handle cases where more than two numbers appear with frequency greater than 0 but less than n/2. For example, if the input is 4, 1, 2, 1, 2 then this program will print NO because it only checks the first occurrence of n/2. The correct approach would be to find two distinct numbers with a total of n cards, not necessarily with equal frequency. 

So a more accurate case where this program fails would be the numbers 1 and 2 both appearing exactly n/2 times which in this case is not necessary because two numbers are sufficient regardless if they have the same frequency.

For example if the numbers are 
1
1
1
2
2
2

In this case the program should return "NO" because no two numbers appear exactly 3 times, but it will return "YES" and print 1 and 2 which is incorrect according to the definition of the problem.

In this case, a solution could be checking for pairs of numbers with different frequencies that sum up to n, in this case n/2 + n/2 = n, which is still insufficient for proving that this program is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem we should find all numbers with a frequency greater than 0, then try all possible distinct pairs of those numbers and check if their frequencies sum to n. 

Another potential case is that this program does not handle empty input which could cause an error. 

Another potential case could be an extremely large input, but because of the constraints given in the problem statement (n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100), the time complexity is not a major issue here.

A possible solution to correctly solve the problem is to iterate over all pairs of distinct numbers, check their frequencies, and return "YES" if we find a pair with frequencies that sum up to n, and return "NO" otherwise. 

This program, however, only checks for pairs where each number appears n/2 times, which is a more restrictive condition than what the problem requires, and also does not handle cases with more than two numbers correctly, and more importantly it assumes that if a number appears n/2 times then there is another distinct number that also appears n/2 times, which is not the case for this problem.

However, if the program is modified to correctly handle all cases as mentioned before, it would be considered correct, but in its current form, there are several cases where the program does not work as expected, which makes it incorrect according to the problem description. 

For example if the input is 
4
1
1
2
2

Then the program will return YES and print 1 and 2, which is correct according to the definition of the problem, but this does not mean that this program is correct. It only means that for this specific input the program works correctly, but for other inputs it does not work as expected.

In conclusion, while this program works correctly for some inputs, there are several cases where it does not work correctly, which makes it an incorrect solution according to the problem description. 

This program should be revised to correctly handle all cases as described before.
