Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. 

Here's why it's correct:

1. The program first reads the number of cards `n` and the integers written on each card, storing them in a list `a`.

2. It then creates a dictionary `d` where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`. This is done to efficiently count the occurrences of each integer.

3. The program then iterates over the dictionary `d` to find two integers that each appear `n/2` times. If such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers.

4. If no such integers are found after iterating over the entire dictionary, the program prints 'NO'.

This implementation correctly meets the problem description because:

- It checks for exactly two integers that each appear `n/2` times.
- It handles cases where there are less than two integers that appear `n/2` times by printing 'NO'.
- It handles cases where there are more than two integers that appear `n/2` times, but since the problem statement guarantees that `n` is even, the number of integers that appear `n/2` times can be either 0, 1, or 2.
- It assumes valid input as stated in the problem description, i.e., `n` is an even number and each integer is between 1 and 100.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all possible cases as described in the problem description.
