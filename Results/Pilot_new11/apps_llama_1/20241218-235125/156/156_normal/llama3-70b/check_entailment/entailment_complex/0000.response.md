Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it doesn't correctly calculate the position of Lara after she moves k times. The problem description states that Lara enters the dungeon at position (1, 1), then moves down to the bottom left corner (n, 1), and then moves in a snake pattern to the right and left, one cell up at a time, until she reaches the final position (1, 2).

However, the program calculates the final position based on the normalized value of k, which is k modulo (2n - 2). This normalization is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the total number of steps Lara takes, including the steps from the top left corner to the bottom left corner, as well as the snake pattern steps.

The program assumes that the normalized value of k is less than 2n - 2, but it doesn't consider the cases where k is greater than n * 2 - 2 and the remainder when k is divided by (n * 2 - 2) plus n * m - (n * 2 - 2) equals or exceeds n * m.

A correct program would need to calculate the number of times Lara goes through the full snake pattern, and then calculate the final position based on the remaining steps. This would require calculating the total number of steps in a full snake pattern (2n - 2) * ((m - 2) // 2 + 1) and then adding the steps to move down the left side (n - 1).

The current program does not accurately model the movement pattern described in the problem description, and therefore, it does not always produce the correct output. 

For example, when n = 4, m = 3 and k = 21, the current program will print a wrong answer. The correct program should first calculate the total steps in a full snake pattern, which is 10 for this example, and then calculate the number of full snake patterns Lara goes through, which is k // 10 = 2. The remaining steps are k % 10 = 1. Then the program should calculate the final position based on these remaining steps, which is (1, 1) in this case. However, the current program will print a wrong answer because it does not accurately model the movement pattern. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
