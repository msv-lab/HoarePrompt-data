Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`, which can also be expressed as `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)`, and initially `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, but currently, the value of `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, and given that `k` is the remainder, it means the current value of `k` is between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 3`**
