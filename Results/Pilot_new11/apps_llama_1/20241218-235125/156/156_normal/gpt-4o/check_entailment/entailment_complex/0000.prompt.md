You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `m - 1`, and `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` is an even positive integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is an odd positive integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is `m - (k % (m - 1))`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n and m are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m. If k is less than n - 1, then the function returns k + 1. Otherwise, the function calculates full_rows as the integer division of k by m - 1, and remaining_steps as k modulo m - 1. Then, it determines row and col based on whether full_rows is even or odd: if full_rows is even, row is n - full_rows and col is 2 + remaining_steps; if full_rows is odd, row is n - full_rows and col is m - (k % (m - 1)). The values of row and col are returned as output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. The function prints two values: if `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`; otherwise, it calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`, and then determines a row and column (`row` and `col`) based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. If `full_rows` is even, `row` is `n - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, `row` is `n - full_rows` and `col` is `m - remaining_steps`. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `m`, or `k`, and it does not handle any potential edge cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` may not meet the specified conditions. The function only performs printing actions and does not return any values, contrary to the annotations which suggest that it returns `row` and `col`. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that two values have been printed to the console, and the input parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
