Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The given code seems to correctly calculate Lara's position after `k` moves. It first checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`, which means Lara has only moved down from the starting position. In this case, it correctly prints the row as `k + 1` and the column as `1`.

If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates the number of full rows Lara has moved through and the remaining steps. Based on whether the number of full rows is even or odd, it determines the row and column.

The code handles the cases when `full_rows` is even or odd correctly. When `full_rows` is even, Lara moves to the right, so the column is `2 + remaining_steps`. When `full_rows` is odd, Lara moves to the left, so the column is `m - remaining_steps`.

The code correctly handles the edge cases where `k` is `0` or `n*m - 1`, which are the starting and ending positions of Lara's path. The examples provided in the problem description also match the output of the code.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the logic to calculate Lara's position after `k` moves, and it handles all the potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
