Postcondition: **`n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m - (n - 1)`, `full_rows` is the integer division of `k` by `m - 1`, and `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`. The number of `full_rows` is odd.**
