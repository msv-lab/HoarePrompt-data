The value of `k` is decreased by `n - 1`. The initial value of `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, so after subtracting `n - 1`, the value of `k` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `n` and `m` are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` is `k - (n - 1)`, which is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n*m - (n - 1)`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n*m - (n - 1)` and `k` is equal to `k - (n - 1)`**
