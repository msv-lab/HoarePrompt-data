The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, where both `x` and `y` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value, which can be either True or False, based on the values of `x` and `y`. However, the specific conditions that determine whether the function returns True or False are not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integer parameters `x` and `y` and return a boolean value based on the evaluation of these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are positive integers, and returns a boolean value.**
