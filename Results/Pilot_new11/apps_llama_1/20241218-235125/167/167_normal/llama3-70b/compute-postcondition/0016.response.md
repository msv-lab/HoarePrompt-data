The code snippet `px, py = nx, ny` updates the values of `px` and `py` to be equal to `nx` and `ny` respectively.

Given the initial state, we have the following conditions:
- `x` is a positive integer
- `y` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list with at least 3 elements
- `v` is the third element in `a`
- `px` equals `(v - 1) // y`
- `py` equals `(v - 1) % y`
- `nx` equals `(v - 1) // y`
- `ny` equals `(v - 1) % y`
- If `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` is not equal to 1, the program returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made.

Since `px` and `py` are updated to be equal to `nx` and `ny` respectively, and given that `nx` equals `(v - 1) // y` and `ny` equals `(v - 1) % y`, we now have `px` equals `nx` equals `(v - 1) // y` and `py` equals `ny` equals `(v - 1) % y`. 

Therefore, after the code execution, `px` and `nx` will have the same value `(v - 1) // y`, and `py` and `ny` will have the same value `(v - 1) % y`. 

Also, given that `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` equals 1 for the program to continue execution, now that `px` equals `nx` and `py` equals `ny`, `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)` equals 0. However, for the rest of the variables that were not explicitly modified by the code, their initial conditions still hold.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `v` is the third element in `a`, `px` equals `nx` equals `(v - 1) // y`, `py` equals `ny` equals `(v - 1) % y`.**
