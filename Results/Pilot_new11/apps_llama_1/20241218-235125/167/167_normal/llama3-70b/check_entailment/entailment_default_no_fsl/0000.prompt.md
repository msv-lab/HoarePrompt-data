You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a matrix A of size x × y filled with integers. For every $i \in [ 1 . . x ]$, $j \in [ 1 . . y ]$ A_{i}, j = y(i - 1) + j. Obviously, every integer from [1..xy] occurs exactly once in this matrix. 

You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} denoting that you started in the cell containing the number a_1, then moved to the cell with the number a_2, and so on.

From the cell located in i-th line and j-th column (we denote this cell as (i, j)) you can move into one of the following cells: (i + 1, j) — only if i < x;  (i, j + 1) — only if j < y;  (i - 1, j) — only if i > 1;  (i, j - 1) — only if j > 1.

Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know x and y exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer a_1, then move to the cell containing a_2 (in one step), then move to the cell containing a_3 (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose x and y so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the integers in the cells on your path.


-----Output-----

If all possible values of x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 contradict with the information about your path, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values x and y such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding 10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input

1 2 3 6 9 8 5 2

YES
3 3

Input
6
1 2 1 2 5 3

Output
NO

Input

1 10

Output
YES
4 9



-----Note-----

The matrix and the path on it in the first test looks like this: [Image] 

Also there exist multiple correct answers for both the first and the third examples.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
dx = [0, 1, 0, -1]
dy = [1, 0, -1, 0]
for x in range(1, 1000001):
    for y in range(1, 1000001):
        if x * y > max(a):
            break
        if all((1 <= v <= x * y for v in a)) and func_1(x, y):
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
print('NO')

def func_1(x, y):
    (px, py) = (0, 0)
    for v in a:
        (nx, ny) = ((v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y)
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        (px, py) = (nx, ny)
    return True


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are positive integers, and returns a boolean value indicating whether a sequence of operations on a list `a` (which is not defined within the provided function scope) satisfies a specific condition. The function checks if the absolute difference in the x and y coordinates of consecutive elements in the sequence is 1, implying a sort of adjacency condition. However, there are several potential issues and edge cases: the variable `a` is not defined within the function, the role of `x` is unclear as it is not used within the function, and the function does not handle cases where the input list `a` might be empty or contain non-integer values. Given these considerations, the function essentially performs a validity check on the sequence in `a` with respect to the divisor `y`, returning `True` if all elements in the sequence satisfy the adjacency condition and `False` otherwise. The final state of the program after it concludes will be that it has returned a boolean value, with `x` and `y` unchanged, and any modifications or accesses to `a`, `px`, `py`, `nx`, `ny`, and `v` being purely internal to the function's operation. Notably, the function appears to have missing logic regarding the utilization of `x` and the definition of `a`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
