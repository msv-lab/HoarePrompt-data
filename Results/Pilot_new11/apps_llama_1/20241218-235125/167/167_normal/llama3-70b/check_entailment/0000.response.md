Correctness: **False**.

The program has a bug in the logic of checking the possible values of x and y. The loop that checks all possible values of x and y only runs up to 1,000,000 for both x and y. However, the problem statement specifies that x and y can be up to 10^9. As a result, the program may miss valid solutions where x or y is larger than 1,000,000.

Additionally, the program does not correctly check all possible moves from one cell to another. The function func_1(x, y) checks if the moves are valid by calculating the Manhattan distance between two cells, but it does not consider the actual moves allowed in the problem description (down, right, up, left).

Another issue is that the program only prints the first valid solution it finds, but the problem statement allows for multiple correct answers. 

To fix this, the program should check all possible values of x and y up to 10^9, and it should correctly implement the moves allowed in the problem description. 

An example where the program does not work correctly is when the input is:

2
1 1000001

The program will print 'NO' because it does not check values of x and y larger than 1,000,000, but a valid solution exists (x = 1, y = 1000001).
