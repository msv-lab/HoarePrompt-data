`max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`. The value of `digit_sum` is greater than the initial value of `max_sum`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer greater than 0, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, and `digit_sum` is greater than its initial value of 1.
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 0, `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, and `digit_sum` is greater than 1**
