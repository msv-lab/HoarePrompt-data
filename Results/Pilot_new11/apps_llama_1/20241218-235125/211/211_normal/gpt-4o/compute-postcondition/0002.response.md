To determine the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- The list `A` is assigned the input list.
- `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
- For 1 ≤ `i` < `len(A)`, -10^3 ≤ `A[i]` ≤ 10^3.
- The input list has at least one element.

Code Snippet:
```python
total_sum = sum(A)
```

This code calculates the sum of all elements in list `A` and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`.

Given that `A[0]` is an integer `n` and the range of other elements, the sum `total_sum` will depend on the specific values of `A`. However, we can determine the range of possible values for `total_sum`.

Since `n` (which is `A[0]`) is between 1 and 100, and each of the remaining elements in `A` can be between -10^3 and 10^3, the minimum possible value for `total_sum` would occur if `n` is 1 and all other elements are -10^3, and the maximum possible value would occur if `n` is 100 and all other elements are 10^3.

However, without knowing the exact number of elements in `A` or their specific values, we cannot determine an exact value for `total_sum`. Instead, we acknowledge that `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`, which includes `n` and the other elements within their specified ranges.

Output State: **The list `A` is assigned the input list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and -10^3 ≤ `A[i]` ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ `i` < `len(A)`, the input list has at least one element, and `total_sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `A`.**
