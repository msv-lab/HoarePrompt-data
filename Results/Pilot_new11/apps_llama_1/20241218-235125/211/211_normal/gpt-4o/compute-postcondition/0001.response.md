The input list has at least one element. The first element of the list is an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3 for the remaining elements in the list. The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns the input list to the variable `A`, where each element is converted to an integer.

Output State: **The list `A` is assigned the input list, where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and -10^3 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ i < len(A), the input list has at least one element.**
