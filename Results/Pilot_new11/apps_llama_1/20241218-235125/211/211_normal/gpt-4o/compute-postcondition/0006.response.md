The code `print('1', n)` prints the string '1' and the value of `n`. The value of `n` is `A[0]`, which is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has been printed and '1' has been printed. 

The list `A` still has the same properties as before: `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and -10^3 ≤ `A[i]` ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ `i` < `len(A)`, the input list has at least one element. 

`total_sum` is still the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **The list `A` is assigned the input list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and -10^3 ≤ `A[i]` ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ `i` < `len(A)`, the input list has at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '1' has been printed twice, and the string '1' along with the value of `n` which is `A[0]` has been printed.**
