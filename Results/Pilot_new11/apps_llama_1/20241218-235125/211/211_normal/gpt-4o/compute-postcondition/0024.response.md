The given code snippet prints 'YES' to the console, but it doesn't modify any variables. The values of `A`, `total_sum`, `i`, and `n` remain the same.

Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, and 'YES' has been printed**
