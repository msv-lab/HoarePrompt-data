The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed to the console, '2' has been printed to the console, '1' and 1 have been printed to the console, and 2 and `n` have been printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
