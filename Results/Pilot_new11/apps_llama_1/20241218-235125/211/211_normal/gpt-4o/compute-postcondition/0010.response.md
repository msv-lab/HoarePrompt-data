The given code snippet is `print('YES')`. This code simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program in any way. 

Therefore, the output state is: `A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, and 'YES' has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, and 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
