The code prints the string '1'. The values of the variables do not change. 'YES' has been printed already and now '1' has also been printed. 
Therefore, the Output State is: The list `A` is assigned the input list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and -10^3 ≤ `A[i]` ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ `i` < `len(A)`, the input list has at least one element, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and `total_sum` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed and '1' has been printed.
