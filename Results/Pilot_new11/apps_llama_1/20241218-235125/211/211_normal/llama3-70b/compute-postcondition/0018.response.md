The provided code is a print statement that prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. This statement does not modify any variables, it only outputs their current values.

Therefore, the states of the variables are not changed. The output state is: `A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `1`, `l` is `1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, and `r` is `1` such that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`. The values of `k`, `l`, and `r` have been printed.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `1`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` have been printed as `1 1 1`.**
