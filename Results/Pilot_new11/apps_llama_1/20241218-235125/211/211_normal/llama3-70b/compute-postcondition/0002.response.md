The code initializes a new list `prefix_sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This variable is new and does not affect the existing variables `A`, `a`, and `n`.

Output State: **The input array `A` is a list of integers, with a length that is an input integer `n`, and each integer in the list is between -10^3 and 10^3, `a` is a list of `n` integers with values between -10^3 and 10^3, `n` is an input integer, and `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
