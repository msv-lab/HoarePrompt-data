The given code prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `n`. This operation does not change the values of any variables. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is the last `r` where `prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]` or 1 if no such `r` exists, `r` is `n`, 'YES' has been printed, and `k`, `l`, `n` have been printed.**
