The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a list of integers to the variable `a`, where the integers are obtained from the input and split into separate values. 

Since the input array A is a list of integers and the length of the array is `n`, and each integer in the list is between -10^3 and 10^3, the new list `a` will have the same properties as the input array A. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: The input array A is a list of integers, with a length that is an input integer `n`, and each integer in the list is between -10^3 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with the same length `n` and the same range of values, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **The input array A is a list of integers, with a length that is an input integer `n`, and each integer in the list is between -10^3 and 10^3, `a` is a list of `n` integers with values between -10^3 and 10^3, and `n` is an input integer.**
