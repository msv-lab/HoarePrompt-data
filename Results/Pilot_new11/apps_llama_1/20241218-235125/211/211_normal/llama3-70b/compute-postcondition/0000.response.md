The input array A is still a list of integers. The length of A, which was n, is now overridden by the new value of n, which is an input integer. The integers in the list A are still between -10^3 and 10^3.

Output State: **The input array A is a list of integers, with a length that is an input integer, and each integer in the list is between -10^3 and 10^3, and n is an input integer**
