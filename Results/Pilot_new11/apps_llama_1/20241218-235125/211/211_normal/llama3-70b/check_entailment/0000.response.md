Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The given program prints the subarray indices in the format "k, l, r" instead of printing "k" on one line and "l, r" on the next line as required by the problem description.

For example, for the input:
```
3
1 2 -3
```
The program will print:
```
YES
2, 1, 2
2, 3, 3
```
Instead of:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```
This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, making its correctness **False**. 

A correct version of the program should be:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        print(k)
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                print(l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r + 1
                print(k)
        print(l, n)
```
