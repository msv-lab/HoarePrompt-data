The initial state provides that `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`. Given this information, we know that `result` is calculated as `n! % (10^9 + 7)`, where `n!` represents the factorial of `n`. 

Since `n` is greater than 1, the factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers up to `n`. The modulo operation `(10^9 + 7)` is applied to this product to prevent the result from becoming too large.

Therefore, when the code `return result` is executed, it returns the factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Output State: **The program returns the factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`, where `n` is an integer greater than 1.**
