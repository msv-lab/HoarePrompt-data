The code `result = result * i % mod` updates the value of `result`. Given the initial state: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 3, we calculate the new value of `result` as follows: 

`result` is now equal to `(2 * 3) % (10^9 + 7)`. 

First, we calculate `2 * 3 = 6`. Then, we calculate `6 % (10^9 + 7)`. Since `6` is less than `10^9 + 7`, `6 % (10^9 + 7)` equals `6`. 

Therefore, the new value of `result` is `6`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 6, `i` is 3**
