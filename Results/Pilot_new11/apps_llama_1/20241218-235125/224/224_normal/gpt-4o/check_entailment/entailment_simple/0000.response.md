Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

For a given integer `n`, the program calculates the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`, which is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`. 

The function `f(p)` is defined as the number of distinct elements among `g_1`, `g_2`,..., `g_n`, where `g_i` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_i`.

It is given that `f_max(n)` is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`.

In order to calculate `f_max(n)`, we can analyze the possible values of `g_i` for each `i`. 

Since `g_i` is the GCD of `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_i`, the possible values of `g_i` are the divisors of `n`. 

For `f(p)` to be maximum, we need to maximize the number of distinct `g_i` values. 

This can be achieved by choosing the permutation `p` such that each `p_i` is a divisor of `i`. 

One such permutation is `1`, `2`,..., `n`, where each `i` is in its original position.

For example, if `n` is 6, one such permutation is `[2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1]`, where each `i` is a divisor of its position.

However, this is not the only permutation that achieves this. 

Any permutation where each prime factor appears in its first possible position will also achieve this.

The function `func_1(n, mod)` calculates the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`. 

This function is used to calculate the number of permutations that achieve the maximum value of `f(p)`.

When `n` is 2, there is only one permutation that achieves the maximum value of `f(p)`, which is `[2, 1]`.

For `n` greater than 2, the program calculates the factorial of `n-1` modulo `10^9 + 7` using the `func_1` function. 

This calculates the number of permutations of the remaining `n-1` numbers that achieve the maximum value of `f(p)`.

The reason for calculating the factorial of `n-1` is that the first number in the permutation is fixed to be the smallest prime factor of `n`. 

The remaining `n-1` numbers can be permuted in any order, and there are `(n-1)!` ways to do this.

The program then prints the result modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n` such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
