You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Program:
```
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
if n == 2:
    result = 1
else:
    result = func_1(n - 1, MOD)
print(result)

def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
    return result


```
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the factorial of a given integer `n` modulo a specified modulus `mod`, where `mod` is typically set to `10^9 + 7`. It accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`, with `n` being an integer greater than 1 and `mod` being an integer greater than 0. The function returns the result of `n!` modulo `mod` for `n` greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the function returns 1, as the factorial of 0 or 1 is 1, and the loop does not execute. However, the annotation mentions that `n` is an integer greater than 1, indicating that the function is designed to handle cases where `n` is greater than 1. The actual code handles the case where `n` is 1 or less by initializing `result` to 1, which covers this edge case implicitly, even though the loop itself will not execute. The final state of the program after it concludes includes the returned value, which is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`, and the parameters `n` and `mod` remaining unchanged. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs `n` and `mod`, assuming they will always meet the specified conditions. The missing functionality in the annotations regarding what happens when `n` is 1 or less is addressed by the code itself, ensuring a return value of 1 in such cases, thereby covering all potential edge cases.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
