The code `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by taking the modulus of the current value of `dp[j]` with `MOD`. 

Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `(3 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD` for `j` equals to `f_max_n`, but for `j` equals to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2])`. However, this value is then taken modulus `MOD`. 

Therefore, `dp[j]` is now equal to `((2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and for `j` equals to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is `(3 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD`, and for all other `j` from `2` to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD` if `j` equals `f_max_n - 1` and `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2])` for other values of `j`, `i` is `2`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[j]` equals `((2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD)`**
