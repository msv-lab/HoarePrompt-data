The code defines a new variable `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is equivalent to `1000000007`. The values of the existing variables `n` and `f_max_n` do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, `MOD` is `1000000007`**
