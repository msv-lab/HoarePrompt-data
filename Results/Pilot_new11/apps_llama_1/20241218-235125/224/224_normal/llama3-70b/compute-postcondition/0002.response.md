The code assigns `dp[0]` the value 1. The other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^6, `f_max_n` is still an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, `MOD` is still 1000000007, and `dp` is still a list of size `f_max_n + 1`. The only change is that `dp[0]` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0**
