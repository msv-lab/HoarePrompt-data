The value of `dp[j]` is increased by `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, the new value of `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and `3 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[f_max_n]` is `(dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % MOD` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`, `i` is `3`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `3 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[f_max_n]` is `(dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % MOD` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`, `i` is `3`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
