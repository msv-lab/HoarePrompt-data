According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), it is guaranteed to be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so it needs to be adjusted to be the first value in the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1**
