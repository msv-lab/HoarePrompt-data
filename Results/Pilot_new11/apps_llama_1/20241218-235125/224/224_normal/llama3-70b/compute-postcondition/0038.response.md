The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `n` and `f_max_n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), and `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of a function `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers 1, 2,..., `n`. After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `dp` at index `f_max_n`, which represents the cumulative sum result at the maximum value `f_max_n`, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo 1000000007. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and f_max_n, where n is an integer between 2 and 10^6, and f_max_n is the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1 to n, and returns the cumulative sum result at index f_max_n, adjusted and taken modulo 1000000007.**
