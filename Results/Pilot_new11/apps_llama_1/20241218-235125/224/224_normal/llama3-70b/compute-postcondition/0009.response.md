The given code `dp[j] %= MOD` calculates the modulus of `dp[j]` with `MOD` (which is `1000000007`) and assigns the result back to `dp[j]`. 

Given that `j` is `f_max_n + 1` and `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0`, the operation `dp[j] %= MOD` will not change the value of `dp[j]` because `0` modulo any number is `0`. 

So, the value of `dp[j]` remains `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The Output State is: `n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 2`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 2` where `dp[0]` is `1`, `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0` and all other elements are `0`, `i` is `1`, `j` is `f_max_n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 2`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 2` where `dp[0]` is `1`, `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0` and all other elements are `0`, `i` is `1`, `j` is `f_max_n + 1`.**
