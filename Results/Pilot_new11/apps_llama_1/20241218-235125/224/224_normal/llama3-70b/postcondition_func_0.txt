The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It accepts two integers and returns their GCD. The return value is determined by the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, not the original value of `a` as stated in the annotations. The function handles all possible integer inputs for `a` and `b`, including edge cases where one or both of the inputs are 0, correctly returning the GCD in these cases. Note that when `b` is 0, the function will return the absolute value of `a`, as the GCD of `a` and 0 is defined to be `a`. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are 0, but based on the code, it will return 0, which is a reasonable definition for the GCD of 0 and 0.
