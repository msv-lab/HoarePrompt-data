Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the function to calculate the number of permutations p of integers 1 to n, such that f(p) is equal to f_max(n), where f(p) is the number of distinct elements among the GCDs of prefixes of p, and f_max(n) is the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1 to n.

However, the provided code seems to be calculating the cumulative sum at index f_max_n in the dp list, which does not directly relate to the problem description. The dp list is initialized with dp[0] = 1 and then updated by adding dp[j-1] to dp[j] for each iteration from 1 to n.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the dp list is intended to store the number of permutations with a certain number of distinct GCDs. However, the update logic of dp[j] += dp[j-1] is incorrect, as it does not consider the actual GCDs of the prefixes of the permutations.

Additionally, the function func_2 calculates the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying func_1 to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to n, starting with res = 0. However, this does not seem to be related to the calculation of f_max(n) as described in the problem description.

Overall, the provided code does not seem to correctly implement the problem description, and there are several logic errors and inconsistencies in the code. 

One example that the code does not handle correctly is when n = 2. According to the problem description, there is only one permutation [1,2] with f(p) = 1 and one permutation [2,1] with f(p) = 2. However, the code does not seem to handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case. 

It seems that the problem description is trying to find the number of permutations where the number of distinct GCDs of prefixes is maximum, which could be solved by using a different approach such as generating all permutations and calculating f(p) for each permutation, and then counting the permutations with the maximum f(p). 

However, without a correct implementation of this approach, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem, so the correctness is False.
