Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem as described. For example, when the input is 6, the code should print:

YES
2
1 2
1 3

However, the code will print:

YES
2
1 3
1 6

This is because the code always prints '1' followed by `n // 2` and '1' followed by `n`, which does not necessarily satisfy the equation `1/2 + 1/3 = 1 - 1/6` for all inputs.

Another issue with the code is that it does not check whether `n // 2` actually divides `n`, which is one of the conditions specified in the problem description. 

In addition, the code does not handle cases where `n` is a prime number. In such cases, the only divisors of `n` are `1` and `n` itself, and it may not be possible to find a sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions.

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
