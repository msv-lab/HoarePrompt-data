The code snippet prints '1' and the value of `n` to the console. This operation does not change the values of `n` or `k`. The values of `n` and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. Also, the print operations that occurred before this code snippet are not affected. 
The state of 'YES' having been printed to the console, 2 having been printed to the console, '1' having been printed to the console, and `n // 2` having been printed to the console are not changed.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 'YES' has been printed to the console, 2 has been printed to the console, '1' has been printed to the console, `n // 2` has been printed to the console, and '1' and `n` have been printed to the console.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 'YES' has been printed to the console, 2 has been printed to the console, '1' has been printed to the console twice, `n // 2` has been printed to the console, and `n` has been printed to the console.**
