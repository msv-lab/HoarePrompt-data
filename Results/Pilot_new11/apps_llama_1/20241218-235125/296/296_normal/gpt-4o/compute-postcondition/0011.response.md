According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, and `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, so `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 3. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 3, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 3**
