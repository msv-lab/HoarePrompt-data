The value of `divisors` is updated by appending `n // i` to it. Given that `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `n // i` will be the integer part of `n / 3`. Since `n` is at least 3, `n // 3` will be at least 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 3, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 3, and `divisors` is a list that includes the values 3 and `n // 3`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 3, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 3, and `divisors` is a list that includes the values 3 and `n // 3`.**
