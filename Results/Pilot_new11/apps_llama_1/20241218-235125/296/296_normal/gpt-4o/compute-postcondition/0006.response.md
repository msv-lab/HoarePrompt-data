The code appends the value of `i` to the `divisors` list. Since `i` is 2, the `divisors` list will now contain the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 2, `divisors` is a list containing the value 2, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2, and `n` is a multiple of `i`.**
