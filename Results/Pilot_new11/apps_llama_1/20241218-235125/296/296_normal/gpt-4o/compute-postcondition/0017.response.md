To calculate the output state, we must consider the impact of the given code on the initial state.

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) <= int(math.sqrt(10^9)) and `n` is strictly larger than 2.
- `i` is 4.
- `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4.
- If `n` is divisible by 3, then if `n` is not equal to 9, `divisors` is a list that includes the values 3 and `n // 3`.

The code snippet is: 
```python
divisors.append(i)
```
This code appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given that `i` is 4, the list `divisors` will now include the value 4 in addition to its previous values.

Thus, considering all conditions:
- `n` remains an integer such that 4 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) <= int(math.sqrt(10^9)) and is strictly larger than 2.
- `i` remains 4.
- `int(math.sqrt(n))` remains at least 4.
- If `n` is divisible by 3 and not equal to 9, `divisors` now includes the values 3, `n // 3`, and 4. If `n` is not divisible by 3 or is equal to 9, `divisors` now includes the value 4, but its initial state regarding divisibility by 3 and inclusion of 3 and `n // 3` is disregarded due to the new append operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) <= int(math.sqrt(10^9)) and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 4, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4, and `divisors` includes the value 4, with additional values depending on the divisibility of `n` by 3 (3 and `n // 3` if `n` is divisible by 3 and not equal to 9).**
