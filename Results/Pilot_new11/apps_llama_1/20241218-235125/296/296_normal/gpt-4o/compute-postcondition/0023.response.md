To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state provides conditions about `n` and its relationship with `i` (where `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`), and it mentions that `divisors` is an empty list because `n` is not strictly larger than 2.

Given that `n` is an integer such that `n` is less than or equal to 2 or `int(math.sqrt(n))` is less than 2, and knowing that `i = int(math.sqrt(n))`, we understand `n` must be a small integer since its square root (as an integer) is less than 2. This implies `n` can be 0, 1, or at most 4 (since `math.sqrt(4)` equals 2, but `int(math.sqrt(4))` equals 2, which fits the condition given for `i` but considering the "less than 2" part, `n` would actually be less than 4 to satisfy all conditions provided).

The code simply returns `'NO'`, without any calculations or changes to the variables `n`, `i`, or `divisors`. Therefore, the output state is purely based on the return statement.

Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**
