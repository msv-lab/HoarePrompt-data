Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 2, `divisors` is a list containing the value 2, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2, and `n` is a multiple of `i`. The current value of `i` is not equal to `n` divided by `i`, meaning `i` is not the square root of `n`.**
