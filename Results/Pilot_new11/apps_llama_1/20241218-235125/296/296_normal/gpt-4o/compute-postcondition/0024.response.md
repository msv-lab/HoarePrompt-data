Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor), and `divisors` is not empty, meaning that `n` is at least 2 and `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2.**
