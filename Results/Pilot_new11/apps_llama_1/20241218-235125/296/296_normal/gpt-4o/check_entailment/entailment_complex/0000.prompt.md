You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is strictly larger than 2
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor). If `n` is less than 2 or `int(math.sqrt(n))` is less than 2, `divisors` is an empty list.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor), and `divisors` is not empty, meaning that `n` is at least 2 and `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors and their quotients up to the square root of `n`, and then lists fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor `d` of `n` as the denominator, where `n` is an integer strictly larger than 2 and the divisors are considered up to the square root of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines if a given integer `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself, and if so, lists these divisors and their corresponding fractions. The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^9 and returns either 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or has no divisors other than 1 and itself, or a string that confirms the presence of divisors, lists them, and includes their corresponding fractions. The function considers divisors up to the square root of `n`, ensuring that all divisors are found due to the mathematical property that a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been accounted for. If divisors are found, the function returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the count of divisors (including their corresponding quotients if they are not equal to the divisor), and then lists fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor as the denominator. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2, and where `n` is a prime number (i.e., has no divisors other than 1 and itself), returning 'NO' in these cases.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
