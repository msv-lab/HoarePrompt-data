Correctness: **False**

The code seems to be partially correct but does not fully solve the problem. The main issue is that it does not correctly calculate the sequence of fractions that sum up to 1 - 1/n.

For example, when the input is 6, the code correctly outputs 'YES' and lists the divisors as 2 and 3, which corresponds to the fractions 1/2 and 1/3. However, these fractions do indeed sum up to 5/6, which is equal to 1 - 1/6.

But in other cases, the code does not ensure that the sum of the fractions is equal to 1 - 1/n. For instance, when the input is 4, the code outputs 'YES' and lists the divisors as 2, which corresponds to the fraction 1/2. However, 1/2 is not equal to 1 - 1/4, which is 3/4.

The code simply lists all divisors of the number and their corresponding fractions, without checking if the sum of these fractions is indeed equal to 1 - 1/n. Therefore, the code does not work correctly for all potential cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the code would need to find a subset of the divisors that can be used to construct fractions that sum up to 1 - 1/n, not just list all divisors. This is a more complex problem that requires a different approach.
