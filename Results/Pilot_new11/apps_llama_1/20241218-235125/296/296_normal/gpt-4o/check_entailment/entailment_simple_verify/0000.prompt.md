You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply generates all divisors of the input number `n` and creates fractions with numerator 1 and denominator equal to each divisor. However, it does not check if the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n`.

For example, when `n = 6`, the program correctly outputs `YES` and provides the sequence `1/2` and `1/3`, which indeed sums up to `1 - 1/6`. However, for `n = 4`, the program outputs `YES` and provides the sequence `1/2` and `1/4`, but the sum of these fractions is `3/4`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`. Although in this case, the program happens to work correctly, it is not the case for all inputs.

But, for `n = 5`, the program outputs `YES` and provides the sequence `1/5`, but the sum of this fraction is `1/5`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. This shows that the program does not work correctly for all inputs.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should find a sequence of fractions that sums up to `1 - 1/n`, which is not guaranteed by the current implementation. 

The current implementation only checks for divisors of `n` and generates fractions with numerator 1, which is not sufficient to solve the problem. A correct solution would require a more complex approach to find the correct sequence of fractions. 

The program could be improved by using a more sophisticated algorithm to find the sequence of fractions, such as using a greedy approach or dynamic programming. However, the current implementation is not correct and does not solve the problem as described.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and n is strictly larger than 2
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor). If `n` is less than 2 or `int(math.sqrt(n))` is less than 2, `divisors` is an empty list.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor), and `divisors` is not empty, meaning that `n` is at least 2 and `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors and their quotients up to the square root of `n`, and then lists fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor `d` of `n` as the denominator, where `n` is an integer strictly larger than 2 and the divisors are considered up to the square root of `n`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
