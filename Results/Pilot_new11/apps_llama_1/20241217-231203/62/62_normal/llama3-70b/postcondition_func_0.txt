The function converts a number represented by a list of digits in a given base to its base 10 equivalent. It accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base` as input, where `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base - 1`. The function returns an integer representing the base 10 equivalent of the input number. If the input list `digits` is empty, the function returns 0. The function handles all potential edge cases, including an empty input list and inputs with varying lengths and values, and it does not modify the input parameters `digits` and `base`. The function performs the conversion by iteratively multiplying the current result by the base and adding the next digit, effectively calculating the base 10 equivalent of the input number.
