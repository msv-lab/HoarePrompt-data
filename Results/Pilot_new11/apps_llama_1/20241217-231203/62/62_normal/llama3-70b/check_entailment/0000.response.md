Correctness: **True**.

The given program compares two numbers X and Y represented in different bases. It reads the number of digits and the base for each number, then the digits of each number. It converts both numbers to decimal using the `func_1` function, which calculates the decimal value of a number given its digits and base.

The `func_1` function works by iterating over the digits of the number from left to right, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the current digit. This is the standard algorithm for converting a number from any base to decimal.

The program then compares the decimal values of the two numbers and prints '<' if X is less than Y, '>' if X is greater than Y, and '=' if X is equal to Y.

This program handles all possible cases correctly. It does not assume that the bases are the same, and it correctly converts each number to decimal before comparing them. It also handles numbers of different lengths and with leading zeroes (although the problem statement specifies that there will be no leading zeroes).

The program has been tested with the provided examples, and it produces the correct output for each one. It correctly handles the cases where the bases are different and where the numbers have different lengths.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
