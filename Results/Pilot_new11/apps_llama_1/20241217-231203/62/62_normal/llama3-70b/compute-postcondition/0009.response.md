The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of integers and `base` is an integer. The function has the following constraints: `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base - 1`. The return value of the function is the base 10 equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`. If `digits` is empty, the function returns 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the base 10 equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`, or 0 if `digits` is empty.**
