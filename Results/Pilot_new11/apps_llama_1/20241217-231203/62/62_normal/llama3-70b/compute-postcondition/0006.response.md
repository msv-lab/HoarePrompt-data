The code `result = result * base + digit` updates the value of `result`. Initially, `result` equals the new `digit * base + digit`, but after the update, it becomes `result * base + digit`. 

Given that `digits` is a list of integers with at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, we can conclude that the states of `digits` and `base` are not affected by the code.

The initial state of `result` is `digit * base + digit`, but after the code is executed, `result` becomes `(digit * base + digit) * base + digit`, which can be simplified to `digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of integers with at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` equals `digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers with at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` equals `digit * base^2 + digit * base + digit`**
