Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly utilizes the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the provided character. The assertions in the program demonstrate that it works for the test cases provided ('A', 'R', 'S') and since `ord()` is a built-in function that accurately converts any single character to its ASCII value, there are no edge cases that would cause it to fail. The program adheres to the problem description for all potential inputs (single characters), and thus is considered correct.
