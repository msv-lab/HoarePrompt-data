Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is supposed to return the ASCII value of a single character. However, it does not handle the case where the input string `char` contains more than one character or is an empty string. According to the problem description, it is specified that the input should be a "single character", but the function does not enforce this requirement.

For example:
- If the input is `"ab"` (a string with two characters), the function will return the ASCII value of the first character `'a'`, which is `97`, but this is not the intended behavior as the function should ideally raise an error or handle it appropriately.
- If the input is `""` (an empty string), the function will raise a `TypeError` since `ord()` expects a single character string.

Due to these cases where the function does not behave as specified in the problem description, the correctness is marked as **False**.
