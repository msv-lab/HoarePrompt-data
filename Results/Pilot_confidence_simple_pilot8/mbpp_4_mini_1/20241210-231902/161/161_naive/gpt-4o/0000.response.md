Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly computes the n-th Lucas number according to the problem description. The Lucas sequence starts with L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The implementation follows this logic accurately.

- For `n = 0`, the function returns 2, which is correct.
- For `n = 1`, the function returns 1, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`, it computes L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3, which is correct.
- For `n = 3`, it computes L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4, which is correct.
- For `n = 4`, it computes L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7, which is correct.
- For `n = 9`, it computes L(9) = L(8) + L(7) = 76, which matches the provided assertion.

The logic is sound, and all tested cases return the expected results. Therefore, there are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected.
