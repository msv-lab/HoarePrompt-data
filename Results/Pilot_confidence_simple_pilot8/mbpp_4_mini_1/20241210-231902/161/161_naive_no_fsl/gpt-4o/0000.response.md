To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description of finding the n-th Lucas number, let's analyze the code and the Lucas number sequence.

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The provided program defines a function `func_1(n)` which is expected to compute the n-th Lucas number. The assertions provided in the code check for specific cases:
- `func_1(9) == 76`
- `func_1(4) == 7`
- `func_1(3) == 4`

Now, let's evaluate the correctness of the function:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - For `n = 0`: The function returns 2, which is correct.
   - For `n = 1`: The function returns 1, which is also correct.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For `n = 2`: The function should compute L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3. The loop will execute once and return `b`, which will be 3. This is correct.
   - For `n = 3`: The function should compute L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4. The assertion `func_1(3) == 4` is correct.
   - For `n = 4`: The function should compute L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7. The assertion `func_1(4) == 7` is correct.
   - For `n = 5`: The function should compute L(5) = L(4) + L(3) = 7 + 4 = 11. This is not tested by the assertions but is correct.
   - For `n = 6`: The function should compute L(6) = L(5) + L(4) = 11 + 7 = 18. This is also not tested but is correct.
   - For `n = 7`: The function should compute L(7) = L(6) + L(5) = 18 + 11 = 29. This is not tested but is correct.
   - For `n = 8`: The function should compute L(8) = L(7) + L(6) = 29 + 18 = 47. This is not tested but is correct.
   - For `n = 9`: The function should compute L(9) = L(8) + L(7) = 47 + 29 = 76. The assertion `func_1(9) == 76` is correct.

The function correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for all tested cases and follows the defined recursive relation for the Lucas sequence.

However, we should also consider edge cases:
- Negative inputs are not handled. If `n` is negative, the function will still execute but will lead to incorrect behavior since the Lucas number is not defined for negative indices.

Since the function does not handle negative inputs and does not define what should happen in such cases, it fails to meet the problem description requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**  
The program does not handle negative inputs, leading to incorrect behavior for such cases.
