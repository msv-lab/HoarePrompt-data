Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 31 days. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function uses a list to store these month numbers and checks if the input month number is in that list. 

The program will return `True` for the valid month numbers that have 31 days and `False` for those that do not (including February, April, June, September, and November). It handles all potential cases as expected.
