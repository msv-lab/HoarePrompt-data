Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input string is empty. According to the problem description, the function should convert a snake case string to camel case. If the input is an empty string (i.e., `snake_case_str = ""`), the expected output should also be an empty string. However, the current implementation will return an empty string, which is technically correct, but it does not explicitly handle this edge case in the context of the problem description. 

Additionally, the function does not handle cases with leading or trailing underscores (e.g., `"_example"` or `"example_"`). These should be addressed since they could produce unexpected results in the output. For example:
- Input: `"_example"` should return `"Example"`, but it currently does not handle this case properly.
- Input: `"example_"` should return `"Example"`, but it currently does not handle this case properly.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
