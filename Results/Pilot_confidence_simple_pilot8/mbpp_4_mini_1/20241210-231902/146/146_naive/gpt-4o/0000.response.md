Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is intended to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, it has a flaw in handling cases where multiple lists have the same maximum length. In such cases, the function should return the first list with the maximum length, but it currently returns the last one processed. 

For example, consider the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`. Here, both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[6, 7, 8]` have the same length of 3. The function will return `(3, [6, 7, 8])`, which is incorrect if we want the first maximum length list.

Thus, the function does not correctly handle the requirement as stated in the problem description.
