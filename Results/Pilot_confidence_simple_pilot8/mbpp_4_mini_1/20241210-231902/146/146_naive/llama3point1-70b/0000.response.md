Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input list of lists is empty. If `list_of_lists` is empty, calling `max()` on the lengths of the sublists will raise a `ValueError` because there are no values to take the maximum of. 

For example, if we call `func_1([])`, it will result in an error instead of returning a valid output. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
