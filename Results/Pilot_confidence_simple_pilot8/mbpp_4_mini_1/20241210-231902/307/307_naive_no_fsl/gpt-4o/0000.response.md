To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1(n)` which is supposed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

### Understanding Triangular Numbers:
Triangular numbers are calculated using the formula:
\[ T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]
where `k` is a positive integer. The triangular number `T_k` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.

### Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. The function should return the index `k` of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits.
2. The function should work correctly for any positive integer `n`.

### Analyzing the Program:
The program uses a loop to calculate triangular numbers starting from `k = 1` and checks the number of digits in each triangular number until it finds one with exactly `n` digits.

### Test Cases Provided:
- For `n = 2`, it returns `4`, which corresponds to the triangular number `10` (the 4th triangular number).
- For `n = 3`, it returns `14`, which corresponds to the triangular number `105` (the 14th triangular number).
- For `n = 4`, it returns `45`, which corresponds to the triangular number `1035` (the 45th triangular number).

### Validating the Logic:
1. The function correctly calculates triangular numbers.
2. It checks the number of digits using `len(str(triangular_number))`.
3. It continues searching until it finds a triangular number with the specified number of digits.

### Edge Cases:
- If `n = 1`, the function should return `1`, since the first triangular number (1) has 1 digit.
- If `n = 5`, the function should return `49`, since the 49th triangular number is `1225`, which has 5 digits.
- If `n = 6`, the function should return `65`, since the 65th triangular number is `2145`, which has 6 digits.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to work correctly for the provided test cases and edge cases. It correctly identifies the smallest triangular number index for any given number of digits.

Correctness: **True**
