Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where a sublist might be empty. For example, if the input is `sublists = [[], [1, 2], [3]]`, the program will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access `sublist[0]` in the empty sublist. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
