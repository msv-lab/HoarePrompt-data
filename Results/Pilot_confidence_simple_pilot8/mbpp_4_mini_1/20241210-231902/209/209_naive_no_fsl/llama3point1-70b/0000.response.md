To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it correctly returns the first element of each sublist from the input list of sublists.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function that retrieves the first element of each sublist.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Sublists**: If the input `sublists` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list, which is correct.
2. **Sublists with No Elements**: If any sublist is empty, trying to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. For example, if `sublists` is `[[], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`, the program will fail because the first sublist is empty.
3. **Sublists with Mixed Types**: If sublists contain different types of elements, the function should still return the first element of each sublist without issues, but this does not affect correctness based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty, which leads to an `IndexError`. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
