Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters from a string that have odd index values. It does this by using a generator expression that iterates over the string with a step of 2, effectively selecting only the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). 

For example:
- If the input string is "abcdef", the characters at even indices are 'a', 'c', and 'e', resulting in the output "ace".
- If the input string is "123456789", the characters at even indices are '1', '3', '5', '7', '9', resulting in the output "13579".

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including empty strings and strings of various lengths. Since there are no scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem description, the program is correct.
