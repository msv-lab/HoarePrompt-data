Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which states that it should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the provided function only retains uppercase characters and ignores lowercase characters entirely. 

For example, consider the input string `"HelloWorld"`. The expected output, based on the problem description, should be `"HW"` (removing the lowercase substrings). However, the function will return an empty string `""` because it does not account for any lowercase letters.

Additionally, if the input string is `"abcDEF"`, the expected output should be `""` (removing all lowercase letters), but the function also incorrectly returns `"DEF"` instead of an empty string. 

Thus, the function fails to correctly implement the specified behavior of removing lowercase substrings from the input string.
