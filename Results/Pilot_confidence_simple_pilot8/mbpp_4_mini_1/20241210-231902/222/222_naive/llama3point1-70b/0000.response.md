Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the implementation only retains uppercase characters and ignores lowercase characters entirely. 

For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the expected output should be "H W" (removing any lowercase letters), but the program instead returns "HW", which is incorrect because it does not handle spaces or other characters appropriately. 

Additionally, for an input like "abcDEF", the expected output would be "DEF", but the program returns "DEF" correctly. However, it fails to account for the requirement to remove lowercase substrings, as it does not actually remove them; it just ignores them in the output. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing lowercase substrings from the string.
