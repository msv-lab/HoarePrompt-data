Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**: The function checks each number, finds no duplicates, and returns `False`. This is correct as there are no duplicates.
2. **Input [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]**: The function encounters `4` the second time and correctly returns `True`, indicating a duplicate is present.
3. **Input [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]**: The function finds `1` as a duplicate on the second encounter and returns `True`, which is accurate.

The function uses a set to track seen numbers, ensuring efficient O(n) time complexity for checking duplicates. All potential cases considered (including arrays with no duplicates, single duplicates, and multiple duplicates) are handled correctly by the implementation. Therefore, I found no cases where the function fails to meet the problem description.
