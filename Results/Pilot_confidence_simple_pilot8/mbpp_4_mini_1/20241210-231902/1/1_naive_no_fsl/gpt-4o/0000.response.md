Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to find shared elements between two lists. It converts the input lists to sets, computes the intersection (common elements) of these sets, and then returns the result as a sorted tuple. 

The provided assertions test the function with various input cases, and all expected outputs align with the function's implementation. 

To summarize the correctness:
1. The function correctly identifies shared elements by using set intersection.
2. The output is sorted and converted to a tuple, which meets the requirements of returning a tuple of shared elements.

Since the program handles the given test cases correctly and there are no edge cases or missing logic identified, the program is considered correct.
