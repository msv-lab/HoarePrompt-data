To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code against the requirements.

The problem description states that the function should check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:

1. **Counting Frequencies**: The program converts the integer `n` into a string to iterate over each digit and counts the frequency of each digit correctly.

2. **Checking Frequencies**: The program then checks if the frequency of each digit is greater than the digit itself. If it finds any digit where the frequency exceeds the digit's value, it returns `False`.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - For the input `0`, the frequency of `0` would be `1`, but since `0` cannot be less than or equal to `0`, the function would incorrectly return `False` for this case. 
   - For input `100`, the digit `0` appears twice, and since `2 > 0`, it would return `False`, which is correct. 
   - For input `222`, the digit `2` appears three times, which would also return `False` since `3 > 2`.

### Conclusion:
The function fails for the input `0` and potentially other cases where a digit appears more times than its value. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where the digit `0` appears, which is a violation of the requirements.
