To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description.

The problem states that the function should take an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

### Breakdown of the Function:

1. **Input Conversion**: The input integer `n` is converted to a string so that we can iterate over each digit.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: A dictionary `frequency` is created to count how many times each digit appears in the number.
3. **Frequency Comparison**: The function then checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. If any digit's frequency exceeds its value, the function returns `False`.
4. **Return Value**: If all digits meet the criteria, the function returns `True`.

### Testing the Function:

The provided assertions are:
- `func_1(1234) == True`: Each digit appears once, which is less than or equal to its value.
- `func_1(51241) == False`: The digit '5' appears once (valid), '1' appears twice (valid), '2' appears once (valid), '4' appears once (valid), but '2' appears twice (invalid since 2 cannot appear more than twice).
- `func_1(321) == True`: Each digit appears once, which is less than or equal to its value.

### Edge Cases:

Now, let's consider an edge case:
- `func_1(1111)`: Here, the digit '1' appears four times. Since the digit itself is '1', it does not satisfy the condition (4 > 1). The expected output should be `False`, but let's see what the function returns.

### Execution of Edge Case:

If we run `func_1(1111)`:
- The frequency dictionary will be `{'1': 4}`.
- The check will compare `4` (frequency of '1') with `1`. Since `4 > 1`, the function will return `False`.

This is indeed the correct behavior.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and considering various test cases, including edge cases, the function behaves correctly as per the problem description. It accurately checks the frequency of each digit against its value.

Thus, since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
