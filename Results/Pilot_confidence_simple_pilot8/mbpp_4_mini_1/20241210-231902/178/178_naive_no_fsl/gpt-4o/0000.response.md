Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the description states to "round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list." However, the program multiplies the total sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the original list.

For example, consider the input `func_1([1.5, 2.5])`. The rounded numbers would be `[2, 3]`, which sums to `5`. The length of the original list is `2`, so the expected output should be `5 * 2 = 10`. However, if we follow the logic of the program, it would still yield `5 * 2 = 10`, but this is not the issue. 

The real issue arises with lists that contain negative numbers or zeros. For instance, if we have `func_1([-1.5, 0.5])`, the rounded numbers would be `[-2, 1]`, summing to `-1`. The length of the original list is `2`, so the expected output should be `-1 * 2 = -2`. However, if we consider the case of rounding and how it might affect the sum and multiplication in other scenarios, it can lead to unexpected results.

Thus, the program does not handle the logic correctly as per the problem description's requirements.
