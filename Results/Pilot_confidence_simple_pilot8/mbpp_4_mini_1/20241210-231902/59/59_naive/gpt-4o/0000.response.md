Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It combines the three input lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the resulting list using the built-in `sorted()` function. The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given test cases, producing the expected sorted output. 

Since the function handles merging and sorting properly for the provided examples, and there are no identified edge cases or potential issues with the logic, I conclude that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
