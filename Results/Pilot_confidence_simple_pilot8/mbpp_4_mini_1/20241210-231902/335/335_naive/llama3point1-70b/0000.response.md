Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle multiple occurrences of the substring within the string. For example, if the input string is "abcabc" and the substring is "abc", the program will return the position of the first occurrence only, which is not in line with the problem description that requires finding all occurrences and their positions. Additionally, if the substring does not exist in the string, the program correctly returns None, which is fine. However, the requirement to return all occurrences is not fulfilled. 

For example:
- Input: `func_1("abcabc", "abc")` should ideally return a list of tuples like `[("abc", 0, 2), ("abc", 3, 5)]`, but the current implementation only returns `("abc", 0, 2)`. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
