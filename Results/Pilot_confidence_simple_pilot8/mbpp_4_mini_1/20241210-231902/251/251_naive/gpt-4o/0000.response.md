Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(x, y)` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). 

1. The calculation for r uses the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is the correct way to compute the radius in polar coordinates.
2. The calculation for θ uses `math.atan2(y, x)`, which correctly computes the angle in radians, taking into account the signs of x and y to determine the correct quadrant.

The provided assertions test the function with specific values, and since the calculations are accurate, the function should work correctly for all valid inputs of x and y. 

There are no edge cases in the problem description that the function does not handle, and it operates correctly for all possible inputs, including negative values for x and y, as well as zero. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
