Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radial distance `r`, which is the correct formula for converting Cartesian coordinates to polar. It also uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle `φ`, which correctly handles all quadrants and edge cases, including when `x` is zero. 

Since the function handles all cases appropriately, including points in all quadrants and the origin, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
