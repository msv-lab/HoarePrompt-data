Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It uses the `all()` function, which returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty). The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` evaluates to `True` for each item that matches the element and `False` otherwise. 

Here are the considerations for potential edge cases:
1. If the list is empty (`lst = []`), `all()` will return `True`, which is correct since there are no items that contradict the condition.
2. If the list contains one item (`lst = [element]`), it will return `True` as the single item matches the element.
3. If the list contains multiple items, it will return `True` only if all items match the element, otherwise it will return `False`.

Thus, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
