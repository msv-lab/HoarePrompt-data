Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, if the list is empty, it should return `True` since there are no items in the list that are not equal to the given element. However, the current implementation of `func_1` will return `True` for an empty list, which is correct, but it does not explicitly handle this case or mention it in the assertions. 

For example:
```python
assert func_1([], 'blue') == True  # This case is not tested in the assertions
```

If the function is called with an empty list, it returns `True`, which is the expected behavior. However, since the problem description does not specify what to do with an empty list and the assertions do not cover this case, it leads to ambiguity. The absence of a test for the empty list case suggests that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, since there is ambiguity in handling an empty list and the tests do not cover all potential cases, the correctness is deemed **False**.
