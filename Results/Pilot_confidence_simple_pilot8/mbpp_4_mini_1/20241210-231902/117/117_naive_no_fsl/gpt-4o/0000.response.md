Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list. It uses a generator expression that iterates through each element in the list and checks if it is an instance of `int`. The use of `sum` adds up the counts of integer elements.

The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:

1. For the input `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`, it correctly counts `1` and `2` as integers, returning `2`.
2. For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, it counts all three elements as integers, returning `3`.
3. For the input `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`, it counts `1` and `4` as integers, returning `2`.

I could not find any edge cases or inputs where the function fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases.
