To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem Description**: The function should take a positive integer `n` and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients, which means we want to sum the values of `C(n, i)` where `i` is even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, ..., up to `n`).

**Program Analysis**:
```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum
```

1. The function initializes a `sum` variable to zero.
2. It iterates over all integers `i` from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each `i`, it checks if `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`).
4. If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient `C(n, i)` using `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to `sum`.
5. Finally, it returns the total `sum`.

**Correctness Check**:
- The program correctly identifies even indices by checking `i % 2 == 0`.
- It uses `math.comb(n, i)` correctly to calculate the binomial coefficients.
- It sums only those coefficients where the index `i` is even.

To further validate, let's consider a few test cases:

- For `n = 0`: 
  - The only binomial coefficient is `C(0, 0) = 1`. 
  - The even index sum is `1`. 
  - The program returns `1`, which is correct.

- For `n = 1`: 
  - The coefficients are `C(1, 0) = 1` and `C(1, 1) = 1`. 
  - The even index sum is `1`. 
  - The program returns `1`, which is correct.

- For `n = 2`: 
  - The coefficients are `C(2, 0) = 1`, `C(2, 1) = 2`, and `C(2, 2) = 1`. 
  - The even index sum is `1 + 1 = 2`. 
  - The program returns `2`, which is correct.

- For `n = 3`: 
  - The coefficients are `C(3, 0) = 1`, `C(3, 1) = 3`, `C(3, 2) = 3`, and `C(3, 3) = 1`. 
  - The even index sum is `1 + 3 = 4`. 
  - The program returns `4`, which is correct.

- For `n = 4`: 
  - The coefficients are `C(4, 0) = 1`, `C(4, 1) = 4`, `C(4, 2) = 6`, `C(4, 3) = 4`, and `C(4, 4) = 1`. 
  - The even index sum is `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`. 
  - The program returns `8`, which is correct.

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected and correctly computes the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices.

Since I could not find any input or potential case where the program does not work correctly, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
