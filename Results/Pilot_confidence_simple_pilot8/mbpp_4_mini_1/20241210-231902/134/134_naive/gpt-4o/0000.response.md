Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The provided function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not represent the sum of the even index binomial coefficients. 

For example, when `n = 4`, the even index binomial coefficients are `C(4, 0)` and `C(4, 2)`, which are `1` and `6`, respectively. Their sum is `7`, not `8` as asserted in the program. 

Thus, the function fails to provide the correct output for this and potentially other values of `n`.
