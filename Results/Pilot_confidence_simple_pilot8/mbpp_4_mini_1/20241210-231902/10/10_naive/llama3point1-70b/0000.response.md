To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it accurately computes the volume of a triangular prism according to the problem description.

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is given by:

\[
V = \text{Area of the base} \times \text{length}
\]

Where the area of the triangular base can be calculated using:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

The program provided is:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

Let's break down the program:

1. It takes three parameters: `b` (base of the triangle), `h` (height of the triangle), and `l` (length of the prism).
2. It computes the volume using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l \).

Now, we need to consider potential edge cases:

- If any of `b`, `h`, or `l` is negative, the volume should logically not be negative, but the program does not handle this case.
- If `b` or `h` is zero, the area would be zero, leading to a volume of zero, which is correct according to the geometric interpretation.
- If `l` is zero, the volume would also be zero, which is correct.

However, the main issue lies in the handling of negative values. For example:

- If `b = -3`, `h = 4`, and `l = 5`, the program would compute the volume as:

\[
V = \frac{1}{2} \times (-3) \times 4 \times 5 = -30
\]

This is incorrect, as volume cannot be negative.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
