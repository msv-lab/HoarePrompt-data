Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of the given number `n` is odd. It uses the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which evaluates to `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. 

The provided assertions test the function with the following cases:

1. `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct since 12 is even.
2. `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct since 7 is odd.
3. `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct since 10 is even.

The function handles all tested cases correctly, and there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would lead to incorrect results based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
