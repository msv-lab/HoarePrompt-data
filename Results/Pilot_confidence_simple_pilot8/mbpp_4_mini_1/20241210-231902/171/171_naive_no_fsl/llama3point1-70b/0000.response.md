Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` uses the modulus operator `%` to check if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will yield 1, and the function will return `True`, indicating that the parity is indeed odd. Conversely, if `n` is even, `n % 2` will yield 0, and the function will return `False`, indicating that the parity is not odd.

All potential cases (such as positive odd numbers, positive even numbers, negative odd numbers, negative even numbers, and zero) are handled correctly by this implementation. For example:
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (1 is odd).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (2 is even).
- `func_1(-1)` returns `True` (-1 is odd).
- `func_1(-2)` returns `False` (-2 is even).
- `func_1(0)` returns `False` (0 is even).

Since the function behaves as expected for all these cases, the program is correct.
