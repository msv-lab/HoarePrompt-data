Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the integer `L` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the expected behavior according to the problem description would be to return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part. However, the current implementation would result in an IndexError because it tries to slice the list beyond its length. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
