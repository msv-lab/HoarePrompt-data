To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

The program sorts the list and then checks two conditions:
1. It verifies that the difference between each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list is exactly 1.
2. It checks that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list, which ensures there are no duplicate values.

Let's consider some potential test cases:

1. **Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - **Expected Output:** `True` (as the numbers are consecutive)
   - **Actual Output:** `True`

2. **Input:** `[3, 1, 2, 4]`
   - **Expected Output:** `True` (as the numbers are consecutive)
   - **Actual Output:** `True`

3. **Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 5]`
   - **Expected Output:** `False` (as 4 is missing)
   - **Actual Output:** `False`

4. **Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 3]`
   - **Expected Output:** `False` (as there is a duplicate)
   - **Actual Output:** `False`

5. **Input:** `[2, 3, 4, 6]`
   - **Expected Output:** `False` (as 5 is missing)
   - **Actual Output:** `False`

6. **Input:** `[]`
   - **Expected Output:** `False` (an empty list does not contain consecutive numbers)
   - **Actual Output:** `True` (the program returns `True` for the empty list since there are no elements to check)

The last test case demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle an empty list, as it should return `False` according to the problem description but returns `True` instead.

Therefore, since the program fails for at least one potential case (the empty list), we conclude that the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
