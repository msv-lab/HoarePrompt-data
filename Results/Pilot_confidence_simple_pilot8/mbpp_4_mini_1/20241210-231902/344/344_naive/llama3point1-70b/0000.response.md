Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

Here's why it works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **If the value is less than the smallest element**: The function will return `0`, which is the correct insertion index.
2. **If the value is greater than the largest element**: The function will return `len(sorted_list)`, which is also correct as it indicates that the value should be inserted at the end of the list.
3. **If the value is equal to an element in the list**: The function will return the index of that element, which is correct.
4. **If the value falls between two elements**: The function will return the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the value, which is the correct insertion point.

Thus, the logic is sound, and it handles all potential edge cases effectively.
