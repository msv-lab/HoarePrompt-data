Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 

Here's an explanation of why the code is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right`, which is designed to find the insertion point in a sorted list where the specified value can be inserted while maintaining the order. This is exactly what the problem requires.

2. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the code are valid test cases:
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the correct insertion point is `4` because `6` would be placed at the end of the list.
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the correct insertion point is `2` because `3` would be inserted between `2` and `4`.
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the correct insertion point is again `4`, as `7` would also be placed at the end.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as inserting a value smaller than all existing elements, larger than all, or equal to an existing element.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
