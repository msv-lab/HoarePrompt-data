To determine the correctness of the provided program for sorting a list of elements, let's analyze the given code:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
    return arr
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The function attempts to sort the list by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the current range (`arr[:size]`), and if it's not already in the correct position (`size - 1`), it performs a series of reverse operations to move the maximum element to its correct position.
   - The outer loop iterates from the length of the list down to 1.

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function uses `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` to find the index of the maximum value. If there are duplicate maximum values, this will always return the index of the first occurrence, which can lead to incorrect behavior.
   - The code does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains only one element. An empty list should return an empty list, and a single-element list should return the same list.
   - The logic of reversing the subarrays may not correctly sort the elements in all scenarios, especially with duplicates.

### Test Cases to Consider:
- **Empty List**: `func_1([])` should return `[]`.
- **Single Element**: `func_1([1])` should return `[1]`.
- **Duplicates**: `func_1([3, 1, 2, 3, 3])` may not return a sorted list correctly due to the way maximum indices are handled.

### Example of Failure:
- For the input `func_1([3, 1, 2, 3, 3])`, the expected sorted output is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`. However, due to the logic of finding the index of the maximum element and the subsequent reversals, the function may not produce the correct order.

### Conclusion:
Since there are potential cases where the program does not work as expected, particularly with duplicates and edge cases such as empty lists or single-element lists, we conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**.
