Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the sorting functionality as described. Specifically, there are several issues:

1. **Scope of Variables**: The function `find_max_index(n)` uses `arr`, but `arr` is not defined within its scope. This will lead to a `NameError` when the function is called.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting algorithm implemented seems to be based on a variant of the pancake sorting technique, but it is incomplete and does not correctly sort the array. The logic for finding the maximum index and flipping is not properly integrated with the array being sorted.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with one element. For example, calling `func_1([])` would not work correctly because the logic assumes that there are elements to sort.

4. **Return Value**: The function `func_1` directly manipulates the array but does not correctly return a sorted array due to the issues mentioned.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements of sorting a list of elements correctly. Therefore, it is incorrect.
