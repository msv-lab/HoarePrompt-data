To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the function correctly sorts a list of elements.

The function `func_1` attempts to sort an array using a variation of the pancake sorting algorithm. It repeatedly finds the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array, flips the array to move that maximum element to the front, and then flips the entire unsorted portion to place it in the correct position.

Let's consider a few potential test cases to verify its correctness:

1. **Basic case**: 
   - Input: `[3, 2, 1]`
   - Expected output: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - The function should correctly sort this input.

2. **Already sorted**: 
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected output: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - The function should leave this input unchanged.

3. **Duplicates**: 
   - Input: `[3, 1, 2, 2]`
   - Expected output: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
   - The function should handle duplicates correctly.

4. **Negative numbers**: 
   - Input: `[0, -1, 2, -3]`
   - Expected output: `[-3, -1, 0, 2]`
   - The function should correctly sort negative numbers.

5. **Empty List**: 
   - Input: `[]`
   - Expected output: `[]`
   - The function should handle an empty list without errors.

6. **Single Element**: 
   - Input: `[5]`
   - Expected output: `[5]`
   - The function should handle a single element correctly.

Now, let's analyze the function against these cases:

1. For the input `[3, 2, 1]`, the function will correctly sort to `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. For `[1, 2, 3]`, it will recognize it's already sorted and return `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. For `[3, 1, 2, 2]`, the function may not correctly handle the duplicates, especially since it uses the `index` method which returns the first occurrence of the maximum value, potentially causing incorrect ordering with duplicates.
4. For `[]`, the function will return `[]`, which is correct.
5. For `[5]`, it will return `[5]`, which is also correct.

The potential issue arises with the handling of duplicates. For example, with the input `[3, 1, 2, 2]`, the function may not sort it correctly due to the way it finds the index of the maximum element. This could lead to the output being `[2, 2, 1, 3]`, which is not sorted.

Thus, there exists at least one case where the function does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
