To determine the correctness of the provided program for checking whether a number is undulating, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function.

### Problem Description:
The function should check if a number is undulating. A number is considered undulating if its digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. 

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The number is converted to a string to evaluate its digits.
2. A loop runs from the second digit to the second-to-last digit (indices 1 to len(n)-2).
3. The condition checks if the current digit is either greater than or less than both its neighboring digits.
4. If the condition is not met, `undulating` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
5. Finally, it returns the value of `undulating`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single-digit numbers** (e.g., `5`): These should be considered undulating, but the loop will not execute, and it will return `True`.
2. **Two-digit numbers** (e.g., `42`): These should also be considered undulating, but again, the loop will not execute, and it will return `True`.
3. **Numbers with repeated digits** (e.g., `121`): This should return `True` since it alternates correctly.
4. **Numbers that do not undulate** (e.g., `123` or `321`): These should return `False`, but the current logic will not correctly identify them because it only checks between digits.

### Problem with the Logic:
The loop only checks for `n[i]` against its neighbors, but it doesn't account for the first and last digits in the number, and it also incorrectly allows for sequences that are strictly increasing or decreasing without alternating.

For example:
- For the input `123`, the function will return `True`, but `123` is not undulating.
- For the input `321`, the function will also return `True`, but `321` is not undulating.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly identify non-undulating numbers due to its flawed logic. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
