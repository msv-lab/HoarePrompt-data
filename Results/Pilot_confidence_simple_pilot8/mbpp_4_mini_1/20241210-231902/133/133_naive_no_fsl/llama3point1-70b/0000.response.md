Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and subtracts the elements of `tup2` from the corresponding elements of `tup1` using the `zip` function to pair the elements by their indices. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Tuple Element-wise Subtraction**: The program iterates through both tuples simultaneously, performing subtraction on elements with the same index.
2. **Handles Tuples of Different Lengths**: The `zip` function stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted, which means if `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths, the function will only subtract elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. This behavior is consistent with how subtraction should be performed in this context.
3. **Returns a Tuple**: The result is returned as a new tuple, which is the required output format.

No edge cases are missed, as the function works for all valid inputs, including empty tuples and tuples of different lengths. Therefore, I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
