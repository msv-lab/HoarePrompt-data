To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Task:** We need to calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
   - The first `n` even natural numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
   - The cubes of these numbers would be: \(2^3, 4^3, 6^3, ..., (2n)^3\).

2. **Code Logic:**
   - The code uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2` (inclusive), with a step of 2.
   - It then calculates the cube of each of these numbers and sums them up.

3. **Range in the Code:**
   - The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates the even numbers correctly:
     - If `n = 1`, it generates: [2]
     - If `n = 2`, it generates: [2, 4]
     - If `n = 3`, it generates: [2, 4, 6]
     - This pattern continues correctly for any positive integer `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 0, the function should ideally return 0 because there are no even natural numbers to sum.
   - If `n` is negative, the program does not handle this case explicitly, but logically, we can assume that there are no even numbers to sum, so it should also return 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers for positive integers and handles the case for `n = 0` implicitly by returning 0. However, it does not handle the case where `n` is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Thus, since the program does not handle the negative case and might not work as expected for all potential inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation:** The program fails to handle negative values of `n`, which could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior. For example, calling `func_1(-1)` does not produce a defined output, which violates the requirement to work for all potential cases.
