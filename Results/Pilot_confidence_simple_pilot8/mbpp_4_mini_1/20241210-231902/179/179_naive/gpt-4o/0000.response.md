Correctness: **False**. 

The function `func_1` is intended to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. However, the assertions provided in the code do not match the expected output of the function. 

For example, if we take `n = 2`, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The cube sum of these numbers should be calculated as follows:

- \(2^3 = 8\)
- \(4^3 = 64\)

Thus, the expected cube sum is \(8 + 64 = 72\), which is correct according to the assertion. 

However, for `n = 3`, the first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The cube sum should be:

- \(2^3 = 8\)
- \(4^3 = 64\)
- \(6^3 = 216\)

The expected cube sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 = 288\), which is also correct according to the assertion. 

For `n = 4`, the first four even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8. The cube sum should be:

- \(2^3 = 8\)
- \(4^3 = 64\)
- \(6^3 = 216\)
- \(8^3 = 512\)

The expected cube sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\), which is also correct according to the assertion.

However, the program does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 (e.g., `n = 0` or negative values). For `n = 0`, the function would return 0, which may not be the intended behavior since there are no even natural numbers to consider. This indicates that the function does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Thus, since the program does not handle the edge case of `n <= 0`, it is considered incorrect.
