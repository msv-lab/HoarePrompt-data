To determine the correctness of the provided program, we first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** The task is to write a Python function that calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
    return cube_sum
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1(n)` generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using the list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This correctly generates the even numbers: for `n=1`, it generates `[2]`, for `n=2`, it generates `[2, 4]`, for `n=3`, it generates `[2, 4, 6]`, and so on.

2. The function then computes the cube of each of these even numbers and sums them up using `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.

3. We can verify the assertions:
   - For `n=2`: The even numbers are `[2, 4]`. The cubes are `2^3 = 8` and `4^3 = 64`. The sum is `8 + 64 = 72`, which matches the assertion.
   - For `n=3`: The even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`. The cubes are `8`, `64`, and `216`. The sum is `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`, which matches the assertion.
   - For `n=4`: The even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. The cubes are `8`, `64`, `216`, and `512`. The sum is `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`, which matches the assertion.

**Edge Cases:**
- We should also consider edge cases such as `n=0` and `n=1`.
  - For `n=0`: The function should ideally return `0` since there are no even numbers to sum.
  - For `n=1`: The function should return `8`, as it only includes the first even number `2`.

The current implementation does not handle the case when `n=0`, as it would result in an empty list and the sum would be `0`, which is correct, but the behavior isn't explicitly verified in the assertions.

Since the program does not have assertions or checks for edge cases like `n=0`, it may not behave as expected in all scenarios.

Therefore, there is a potential case where the program does not explicitly handle the input `n=0`, leading to uncertainty about correctness.

Correctness: **False**
