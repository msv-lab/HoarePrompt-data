Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle all whitespace characters, only spaces (' '). For example, if the input string contains tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or multiple types of whitespace characters, they will not be removed. 

For instance, consider the input:
```python
func_1('python\tprogram\n')
```
The expected output should be `'pythonprogram'`, but the actual output will be `'python\tprogram\n'`, which demonstrates that the function does not correctly remove all whitespaces as required by the problem description.
