Correctness: **False**

The provided program only removes spaces (' ') from the input string. However, the problem description states to remove "all whitespaces," which includes not just spaces but also other whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and other forms of whitespace.

For example, given the input string `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the expected output should be `"HelloWorld"` after removing all whitespaces. However, the program will return `"HelloWorld\n"` because it does not handle the tab and newline characters.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
