Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it returns a new dictionary that includes only the entries from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

The program uses a dictionary comprehension which efficiently filters the dictionary based on the specified condition. It handles all potential cases, including:

1. An empty dictionary: The output will be an empty dictionary, which is correct.
2. All values less than `n`: The output will also be an empty dictionary, which is correct.
3. All values greater than or equal to `n`: The output will be the same as the input dictionary, which is correct.
4. Mixed values: It will correctly filter out entries that do not meet the condition.

Since the program behaves as expected for all potential cases, it is correct.
