Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. The provided assertions test the function with various degrees (90, 60, and 120), and the outputs match the expected radian values. 

Additionally, the formula works for all valid inputs (positive, negative, and zero degrees), as it is a linear transformation. Since there are no edge cases or unexpected inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description, the program is correct.
