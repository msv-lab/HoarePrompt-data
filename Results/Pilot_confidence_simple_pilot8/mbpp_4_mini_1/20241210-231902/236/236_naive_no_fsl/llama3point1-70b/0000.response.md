Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(nums)` checks whether the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version using the built-in `sorted()` function. 

This implementation correctly handles the following cases:
1. An empty list is considered sorted, and `sorted([])` returns an empty list, so the function will return `True`.
2. A list with one element is also sorted, and `sorted([1])` returns the same list, so the function will return `True`.
3. For a list with multiple elements, `sorted(nums)` will return the elements in non-decreasing order, and the function checks if the original list is the same as this sorted list.

Since the function correctly identifies whether any list (including edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists) is sorted or not, it meets the problem description requirements in all potential cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
