Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` iterates through the array `arr` in reverse order, checking if the current element is equal to `x`. If it finds a match, it returns the index of that match. If no match is found after checking all elements, it returns -1.

2. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided cover various scenarios:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` returns `0`, which is correct as `1` is at index `0`.
   - `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` returns `2`, which is correct as the last occurrence of `1` is at index `2`.
   - `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` returns `3`, which is correct as the last occurrence of `3` is at index `3`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases, such as:
   - If the element is not found in the array, it returns `-1`, which is appropriate.
   - The function works for arrays of different lengths, including empty arrays.

Since all potential cases that I could think of work correctly and align with the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
