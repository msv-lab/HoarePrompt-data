Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element `x` in the sorted array `arr`. The logic iterates through the array from the last index to the first, checking if the current element matches `x`. If a match is found, the index is returned immediately, ensuring that the last occurrence of `x` is identified. If `x` is not found in the array, the function returns `-1`, which is the expected behavior. 

The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as intended for the given test cases:

1. For the input `([1, 2, 3], 1)`, it correctly returns `0`, the index of the last occurrence of `1`.
2. For `([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)`, it returns `2`, the index of the last occurrence of `1`.
3. For `([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)`, it returns `3`, the index of the last occurrence of `3`.

Since all potential cases considered work correctly according to the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
