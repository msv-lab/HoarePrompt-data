To determine the correctness of the provided program for checking if an expression is balanced, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

The problem requires a function that checks if the given expression (which may contain parentheses, braces, and brackets) is balanced. A balanced expression means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
    return stack == []
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty stack and a dictionary of matching pairs for the brackets.

2. **Processing Characters**: 
   - For each character in the input expression:
     - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), it is pushed onto the stack.
     - If it is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`):
       - The function checks if the stack is empty (which would mean there is no corresponding opening bracket).
       - If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element and checks if it matches the expected opening bracket for the current closing bracket.

3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack indicates that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- An input with no brackets (e.g., an empty string or a string with only letters) should return `True` since there are no unmatched brackets.
- An input with only opening brackets (e.g., `{{{`) should return `False` since they are unmatched.
- An input with only closing brackets (e.g., `}}}`) should also return `False`.
- Mixed inputs with incorrect ordering (e.g., `{[})`) should return `False`.

### Testing the Code:
Let’s test the provided assertions and consider additional edge cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `{()}[{}]` → Expected: `True` (Balanced)
- **Test Case 2**: `{()}[{]` → Expected: `False` (Not balanced)
- **Test Case 3**: `{()}[{}][]({})` → Expected: `True` (Balanced)
- **Additional Test Case**: `[{]}` → Expected: `False` (Not balanced)
- **Additional Test Case**: `{{{` → Expected: `False` (Not balanced)
- **Additional Test Case**: `}}}` → Expected: `False` (Not balanced)
- **Additional Test Case**: `abc` → Expected: `True` (No brackets)
- **Additional Test Case**: `` (empty string) → Expected: `True` (No brackets)

### Conclusion:
The function works correctly for the provided test cases and additional edge cases. It accurately identifies balanced and unbalanced expressions based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
