Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. 

The function handles the following cases:
1. If an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack.
2. If a closing bracket is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty (which would indicate an unmatched closing bracket) or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket (indicating an imbalance).
3. At the end, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been matched and closed properly.

The function will correctly return `True` for balanced expressions like `"{[()]}"` and `"[{}]"`, and `False` for unbalanced expressions like `"{[(])}"` or `"{{}"`. 

Since I cannot find any case where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
