To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the problem description, which requires checking if a given expression of parentheses is balanced.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Input Handling**: The function iterates over each character in the input string `expr`.
2. **Stack Usage**: It utilizes a stack to keep track of opening parentheses. When it encounters an opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `{`, or `[`), it pushes it onto the stack.
3. **Matching Logic**: When it encounters a closing bracket (i.e., `)`, `}`, or `]`), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the expression is balanced, and it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Provided Test Cases:

- `func_1('{()}[{}]')` returns `True` (balanced).
- `func_1('{()}[{]')` returns `False` (not balanced).
- `func_1('{()}[{}][]({})')` returns `True` (balanced).

### Potential Edge Cases:

To ensure the program handles all potential cases, we should consider additional test cases:

1. **Empty String**: `func_1('')` should return `True` because an empty expression is considered balanced.
2. **Unmatched Opening Bracket**: `func_1('{')` should return `False` because there is an unmatched opening bracket.
3. **Unmatched Closing Bracket**: `func_1('}')` should return `False` for the same reason.
4. **Mixed Types**: `func_1('{[()]}')` should return `True` (balanced).
5. **Incorrect Order**: `func_1('{[}]')` should return `False` because the brackets are not in the correct order.

### Testing the Edge Cases:

- For the empty string case: 
  ```python
  assert func_1('') == True  # This should return True.
  ```

- For unmatched opening bracket:
  ```python
  assert func_1('{') == False  # This should return False.
  ```

- For unmatched closing bracket:
  ```python
  assert func_1('}') == False  # This should return False.
  ```

- For mixed types:
  ```python
  assert func_1('{[()]}') == True  # This should return True.
  ```

- For incorrect order:
  ```python
  assert func_1('{[}]') == False  # This should return False.
  ```

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` correctly handles several test cases, including the provided ones. However, it fails to handle the empty string case correctly as the function should return `True` for an empty input, which is not explicitly tested in the original assertions. 

Therefore, since we found a case where the program does not work as expected (the empty string case), the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
