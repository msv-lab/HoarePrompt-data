To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the code implementation.

### Problem Description:
The requirement is to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` iterates through all indices of the list. It checks:
- If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
- If the number at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

If both conditions are true, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

### Potential Cases:
1. **Case with all odd indices containing odd numbers**:
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` → Odd indices (1, 3) have values (2, 4) → Should return `False`.
   - Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7]` → Odd indices (1) has value (3) → Should return `True`.

2. **Case with empty list**:
   - Input: `[]` → There are no odd indices → Should return `True`.

3. **Case with only one element**:
   - Input: `[1]` → No odd index → Should return `True`.

4. **Case with only odd indexed elements being even**:
   - Input: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` → Odd indices (1, 3) have values (1, 3) → Should return `True`.
   - Input: `[0, 2, 4, 6]` → Odd indices (1, 3) have values (2, 6) → Should return `False`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly identify cases where odd indices contain odd numbers. Specifically, it incorrectly returns `True` for lists where odd indices contain even numbers, which contradicts the requirement to check for odd numbers at odd indices.

For example, the input `[0, 2, 4, 6]` should return `False` because both odd indices (1 and 3) contain even numbers, but the program does not handle this correctly.

Correctness: **False**
