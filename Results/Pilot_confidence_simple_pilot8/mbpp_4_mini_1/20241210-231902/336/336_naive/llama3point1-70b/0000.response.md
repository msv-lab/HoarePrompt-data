Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the list is empty. According to the problem description, it should check whether every odd index contains odd numbers. If the list is empty, there are no odd indices to check, and the function should ideally return `True`. However, the current implementation will return `True` for an empty list, which is not incorrect, but it doesn't explicitly handle or consider the edge case of an empty list in the context of the problem description. 

Additionally, the program does not check for the case where the list has odd indices but does not contain any elements at those indices, which could lead to confusion. For example, if the list has only one element (e.g., `[1]`), it will return `True`, but it does not actually check for the condition described. 

Thus, while the function may seem to work correctly for many cases, it does not comprehensively meet the requirements as outlined in the problem description.
