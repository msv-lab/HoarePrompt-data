Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly extracts the last character of each string from the given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `strings` and retrieves the last character using `s[-1]`.

Here are the considerations for correctness:
1. If the input tuple is empty, the output will be an empty list, which is expected behavior.
2. If any string in the tuple is empty, attempting to access `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`. This is a potential edge case that the program does not handle, as it would result in a runtime error rather than returning a valid output.
3. If all strings are non-empty, the program will correctly return a list of the last characters.

Given that the program does not handle the case of empty strings, it does not meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

Example of failure: 
- Input: `("", "hello", "world")` would raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `s[-1]` for the first string.
