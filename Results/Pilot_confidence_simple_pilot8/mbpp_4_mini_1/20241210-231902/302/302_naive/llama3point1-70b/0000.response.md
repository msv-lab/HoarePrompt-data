Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The main issue lies in the fact that the program does not take advantage of the sorted property of the array, which can lead to inefficiencies and incorrect results in certain cases.

For example, consider the input:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
num = 2
```
The expected output is `1`, as the first occurrence of `2` is at index `1`. However, the function will return `1` in this case, which is correct. 

Now consider the input:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
num = 6
```
The expected output is `-1`, which the function also correctly returns.

However, if we consider an input where the number appears multiple times at the end of the array:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]
num = 5
```
The function will return `4`, which is correct.

The main issue is that the function does not utilize the sorted nature of the array, which could lead to inefficiencies in larger datasets. For example, it could be optimized to use binary search to find the first occurrence of the number, but instead, it performs a linear search.

Thus, while it works for the given examples, it does not fulfill the requirement of finding the first occurrence efficiently in a sorted array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
