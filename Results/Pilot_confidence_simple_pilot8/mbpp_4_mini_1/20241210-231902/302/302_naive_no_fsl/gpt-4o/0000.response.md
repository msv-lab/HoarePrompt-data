Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The logic employed ensures that when the target is found, the search continues to the left (i.e., `high = mid - 1`) to find the first occurrence. 

The provided assertions also cover various cases, including:
1. The target number appearing multiple times.
2. The target number appearing at the beginning of the array.
3. The target number appearing at the end of the array.

The function returns the correct index in all tested scenarios. Additionally, no edge cases or potential failures are identified based on the problem description. Thus, the function meets the requirements as specified.
