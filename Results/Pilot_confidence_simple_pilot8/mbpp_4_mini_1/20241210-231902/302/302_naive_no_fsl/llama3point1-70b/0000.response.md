Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checking each element against the target number. If a match is found, it returns the index immediately. If the number is not found in the array, it returns -1, which is the expected behavior.

Since the function performs these operations correctly for all potential cases, including:
- An empty array (returns -1)
- A number not present in the array (returns -1)
- The first occurrence of a number in a sorted array (returns the correct index)

There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
