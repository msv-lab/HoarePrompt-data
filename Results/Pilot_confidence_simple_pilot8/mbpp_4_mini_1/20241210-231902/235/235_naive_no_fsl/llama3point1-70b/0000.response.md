Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string to iterate over each digit, converts each character back to an integer, and then sums these integers using the built-in `sum()` function.

The program handles all non-negative integers, including edge cases such as:
- `n = 0`, which results in a sum of `0`.
- `n = 123`, which results in a sum of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- Large numbers, like `n = 9876543210`, which correctly sums to `45`.

There are no missing cases or logic errors that would cause the program to fail for any valid non-negative integer input. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description.
