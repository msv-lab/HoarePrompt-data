Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of the number (using `n % 10`), adds it to the total, and then removes the last digit (using `n //= 10`). This process continues until `n` becomes 0. 

The provided assertions (`func_1(345) == 12`, `func_1(12) == 3`, and `func_1(97) == 16`) demonstrate that the function works correctly for those cases. Additionally, since the function is designed to handle any non-negative integer, it will also work correctly for other inputs, including 0. 

For example:
- `func_1(0)` would return 0, which is correct since the sum of the digits in 0 is 0.
- `func_1(1000)` would return 1, which is correct since the sum of the digits in 1000 is 1.

No edge cases or potential failures have been identified, confirming that the implementation adheres to the problem description.
