Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. Here's why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The function checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2. If so, it returns 0, which is a sensible output since at least two elements are needed to compute a difference.

2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted first. This is crucial because the minimum difference can only occur between adjacent elements in a sorted array. 

3. **Difference Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted array and calculates the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference found.

4. **Returned Value**: Finally, it returns the minimum difference, which is the required output.

The provided assertions also test various scenarios, and they all pass, indicating that the function behaves as expected for those cases.

Since I cannot find any edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
