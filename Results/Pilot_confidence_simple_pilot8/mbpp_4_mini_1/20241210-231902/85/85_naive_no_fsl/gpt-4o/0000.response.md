Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the input array. The logic implemented in the function works as follows:

1. It calculates the minimum value in the array using `min(arr)`.
2. It calculates the maximum value in the array using `max(arr)`.
3. It computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The provided assertions test the function with various inputs, and all pass as expected. 

Additionally, the function handles edge cases such as when the array has only one element (where the max difference would be 0, since there are no two distinct elements to compare). 

Thus, all potential cases have been considered, and the function behaves correctly according to the problem description.
