To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1(arr)`.

The problem description requires the function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The program calculates this by returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Let's consider the following potential cases:

1. **Normal Case**: For an array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, the maximum is `5` and the minimum is `1`. The difference is `5 - 1 = 4`, which is correct.

2. **Single Element Case**: For an array `[7]`, the maximum and minimum are both `7`. The difference is `7 - 7 = 0`. This is correct as well.

3. **All Elements Same**: For an array `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, the maximum and minimum are both `2`. The difference is `2 - 2 = 0`, which is also correct.

4. **Empty Array Case**: For an empty array `[]`, calling `max()` or `min()` will raise a `ValueError` since there are no elements to operate on. This case is not handled by the program, leading to an error.

The program fails to handle the case of an empty array, which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
