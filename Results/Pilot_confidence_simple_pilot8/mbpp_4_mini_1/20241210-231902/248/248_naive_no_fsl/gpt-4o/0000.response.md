Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. It takes a list as input and uses the `tuple()` constructor to convert the list into a tuple. 

I tested the function with the provided assertions, and it produced the expected results:
- `func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3])` correctly returns `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`.
- `func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7])` correctly returns `(2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`.
- `func_1([58, 44, 56])` correctly returns `(58, 44, 56)`.

Additionally, the function should work correctly for any list, including:
- An empty list: `func_1([])` returns `()`.
- A list with mixed types: `func_1([1, 'two', 3.0])` returns `(1, 'two', 3.0)`.

Since I cannot find any input cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
