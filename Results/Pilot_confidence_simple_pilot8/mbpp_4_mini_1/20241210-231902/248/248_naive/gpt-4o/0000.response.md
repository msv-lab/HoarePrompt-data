Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly converts a list to a tuple. It uses the built-in `tuple()` function, which handles all cases of list conversion properly, including empty lists and lists with various data types. The assertions provided confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs where this function would fail to meet the problem description, the implementation is correct.
