To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description: it should check if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

Here is the code provided:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

The assertions given are:

```python
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False
```

### Analysis:

1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function checks if 'z' is present in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which means it checks the string from the second character to the second-to-last character. 
   - If 'z' is found in that range, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('pythonzabc.')`: This should return `True` because 'z' is present at index 6, which is within the range being checked.
   - `func_1('zxyabc.')`: This should return `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string, which is not allowed according to the problem description.
   - `func_1('  lang  .')`: This should return `False` because there is no 'z' in the string.

### Missing Edge Cases:

Now, let's consider some additional cases that might not be covered by the assertions:

- What if the input string is just a single character like `'z'`? The function should return `False` because there are no characters to check in the range `s[1:-1]`.
- What if the input string is empty `''`? The function should also return `False`.
- What if the input string is `'zabc'`? The function should return `False` because 'z' is at the start.
- What if the input string is `'abc z'`? The function should return `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the string.

### Conclusion:

The function does not handle the case for empty strings or strings with only one character correctly. For example, `func_1('z')` would return `False`, but it is not explicitly checked in the assertions. 

Thus, since there are edge cases where the function does not work as expected, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The function fails to account for strings that are too short or empty, which does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
