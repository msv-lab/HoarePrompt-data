Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists. It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to ensure that any sum from the sublists will be greater. It iterates through each sublist, calculates the sum of the elements, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` whenever it finds a sublist with a greater sum than the current maximum.

The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases, and they confirm that the function behaves as expected for those inputs. The function should also work for other potential cases, including:

1. An empty list of lists: `func_1([])` should ideally return an empty list or raise an error, but the current implementation does not handle this case explicitly. However, since the problem description does not specify the behavior for an empty input, we can consider the implementation correct as it matches the provided examples.
2. Lists with negative numbers: The function will correctly identify the sublist with the maximum sum, even if all numbers are negative.
3. Multiple sublists with the same maximum sum: The function will return the first sublist it encounters with that maximum sum.

Since I could not identify any case where the function does not meet the problem description, it is correct.
