To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description, which is to extract elementwise results from two tuples.

### Analyzing the Function:
The function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and computes the elementwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples using the bitwise AND operator `&`. The result is returned as a new tuple.

### Test Cases Provided:
1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` should return `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))` should return `(1, 2, 3, 0)`.
3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))` should return `(0, 9, 10, 0)`.

### Checking the Expected Outputs:
Let's evaluate the expected outputs of the function for each test case:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `10 & 5 = 0`
   - `4 & 2 = 0`
   - `6 & 3 = 2`
   - `9 & 3 = 1`
   - Result: `(0, 0, 2, 1)` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `1 & 5 = 1`
   - `2 & 6 = 2`
   - `3 & 7 = 3`
   - `4 & 8 = 0`
   - Result: `(1, 2, 3, 0)` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `8 & 7 = 0`
   - `9 & 13 = 9`
   - `11 & 14 = 10`
   - `12 & 17 = 0`
   - Result: `(0, 9, 10, 0)` (Incorrect: the expected output is `(0, 9, 10, 0)`)

### Conclusion:
The third test case provided in the assertions does not match the expected output based on the function's implementation. The expected output for the third test case was incorrectly stated as `(0, 9, 10, 0)` when it should have been `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, indicating that the function does not handle the case correctly.

Since the program does not work correctly for at least one input case, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
