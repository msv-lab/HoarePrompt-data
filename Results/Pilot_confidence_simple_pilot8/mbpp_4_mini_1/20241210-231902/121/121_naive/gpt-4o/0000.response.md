Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but it does not actually compute prime numbers; instead, it computes a sequence based on the recurrence relation \( S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \). 

For example, when calling `func_1(3)`, it returns 7, which is correct for the 3rd term in the sequence. However, when calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(1)`, it incorrectly returns 1, which is not a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The program does not handle the case for n = 0 and n = 1 correctly, as the first Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is actually 2, not 1. 

Thus, since the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, it is incorrect.
