To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1(numbers)`.

The problem description states that we need to "multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list." 

Let's break down the function:

1. It initializes a variable `product` to 1.
2. It iterates over each number in the list `numbers`, multiplying each `num` to `product`.
3. Finally, it returns the `product` divided by the length of the list `numbers`.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

- If the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, which will lead to a division by zero error.
- If the input list contains a zero, the product will be zero, and the final result will be zero, which is mathematically correct, but we need to ensure that the function handles all cases correctly.

Given these considerations, the function will fail when the input list is empty:

```python
print(func_1([]))  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
```

Since the program does not handle the case of an empty list, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
