Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If `func_1` is called with an empty list, it will result in a division by zero error when it attempts to calculate `result = product / len(numbers)`, since `len(numbers)` will be 0. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for this potential case.
