Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly filters odd numbers from the input list. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2 != 0`, which identifies odd numbers. 

This implementation will work for all potential cases, including:
- An empty list, which will return an empty list.
- A list with only even numbers, which will also return an empty list.
- A list with all odd numbers, which will return the same list.
- A list with a mix of odd and even numbers, which will return only the odd numbers.

Since it accurately handles all these scenarios, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
