Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a given list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). 

The provided assertions test the function with various lists, and all expected outputs align with the behavior of the function. 

1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` correctly includes all odd numbers.
2. For the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, the output `[45, 67, 93]` correctly includes all odd numbers.
3. For the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, the output `[5, 7, 9, 3]` correctly includes all odd numbers.

Additionally, the function will correctly handle edge cases such as:
- An empty list `[]`, which will return `[]`.
- A list with no odd numbers, e.g., `[2, 4, 6]`, which will return `[]`.
- A list with all odd numbers, e.g., `[1, 3, 5]`, which will return `[1, 3, 5]`.

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, I conclude that the function is correct.
