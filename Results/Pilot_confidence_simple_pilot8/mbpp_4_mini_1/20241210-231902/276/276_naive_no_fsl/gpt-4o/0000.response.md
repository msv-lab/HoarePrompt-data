To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and determine if it correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes two sorted lists (`list1` and `list2`) and an integer `n`, which is the size of each list.
2. **Merging Lists**: The function merges the two lists and sorts them.
3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the total number of elements is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements.
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

### Key Points to Consider:
- The function merges the two lists and sorts them, which is correct.
- It calculates the median based on the total number of elements, which is also correct.
- The function does not explicitly check if the input lists are sorted, but since the problem states they are sorted, we assume this is a given condition.
  
### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Lists**: If both lists are empty, the function will raise an error because it tries to access elements in an empty list.
2. **Single Element Lists**: If both lists contain a single element, the median should be the average of those two elements.
3. **Negative Numbers**: Lists containing negative numbers should also be handled correctly.
4. **Identical Elements**: Lists with the same elements should return that element as the median.

### Testing an Edge Case:
- If we test with two empty lists, `func_1([], [], 0)` would raise an error because `merged_list` would be empty and trying to access `merged_list[mid]` would be out of range.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the case of empty lists correctly, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
