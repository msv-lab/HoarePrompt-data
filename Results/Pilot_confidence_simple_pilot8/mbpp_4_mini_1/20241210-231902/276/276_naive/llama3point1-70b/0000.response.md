Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Specifically, the calculation of the `middle_index` and the logic for determining the median based on whether `size` is even or odd is flawed.

1. **Incorrect Index Calculation**: The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is correct for accessing the last element of the list, but does not accurately reflect the middle index for calculating the median in the context of two lists. When merging two lists of size `size`, the correct middle indices for an even-sized merged list should be `size - 1` and `size`, not `size - 1` and `size + 1`.

2. **Even Size Handling**: The program assumes that `size` is the size of each individual list. However, since the merged list will have a size of `2 * size`, the median calculation for an even-sized merged list should consider the two middle elements at indices `size - 1` and `size`. 

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, both lists have a size of 2. The merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, the program will incorrectly attempt to access `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]`, leading to incorrect median calculation.

Thus, the program fails to handle the median calculation for the case of two sorted lists of the same size correctly.
