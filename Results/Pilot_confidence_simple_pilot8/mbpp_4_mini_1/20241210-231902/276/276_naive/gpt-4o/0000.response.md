Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the lists are of odd size. The problem description states that the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the implementation merges the two lists and computes the median based on the merged list's length. 

In the assertion tests, the lists have even sizes, and the function works correctly for those cases. However, if we consider two sorted lists of odd size, for example:

```python
assert func_1([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], 3)  # This should return 3.5
```

In this case, the merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and the median would be `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`. However, if the lists were of different sizes or the implementation did not properly account for the fact that the input lists must always be of the same size, it could lead to incorrect results.

Thus, the program fails to address the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
