Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to compute the angle (or phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The `cmath.phase()` function is used to return the angle in radians, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of the angle of a complex number.

The program will handle all potential cases, including:
- Complex numbers with positive and negative real and imaginary parts.
- Complex numbers that lie on the axes (e.g., purely real or purely imaginary).
- The case where both real and imaginary parts are zero, which will return an angle of 0.

Since the implementation accurately computes the angle for all possible inputs, there are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
