Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly computes the angle (or phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function, which is designed for this purpose. The function takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as inputs, constructs the complex number, and then returns its angle in radians. 

Since the `cmath.phase` function handles all potential cases for complex numbers, including those with zero real or imaginary parts, the implementation satisfies the problem description for all possible inputs. Therefore, I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected.
