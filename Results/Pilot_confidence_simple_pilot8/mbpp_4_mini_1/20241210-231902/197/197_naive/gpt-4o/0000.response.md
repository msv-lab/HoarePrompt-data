Correctness: **False**.

The program `func_1` is intended to count the occurrences of specified elements from a list within a tuple. However, it does not handle the case where the list of elements is empty. If an empty list is passed as the second argument, the function will return `0`, which might be correct in terms of counting occurrences, but it does not align with the problem description's intent to count occurrences of elements in the tuple. 

For example:
```python
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), []) == 0  # This case is not explicitly handled.
```

In this case, the function does not provide any indication of handling an empty list of elements, so it does not fully meet the problem requirements. Thus, the correctness is deemed false.
