To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to take a list and an integer `n`, and split the list for every `nth` element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. The function uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range of `n`.
2. For each `i` in the range of `n`, it creates a slice of the list `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`th element thereafter. This is done using the slicing syntax `lst[i::n]`.

### Example Cases:
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the expected output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`. 
  - The function would return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which is correct.
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 3`, the expected output is `[[1, 4], [2, 5], [3]]`.
  - The function would return `[[1, 4], [2, 5], [3]]`, which is correct.
- If `lst = []` (an empty list) and `n = 1`, the expected output is `[[]]`.
  - The function would return `[[]]`, which is correct.
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 0`, this would raise an error because the range would be `range(0)` which is invalid.
  - The function does not handle the case when `n` is zero, leading to a `ValueError`.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly handle the case where `n` is zero, which is a potential edge case that violates the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
