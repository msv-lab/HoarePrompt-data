To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. Specifically, for each position in the tuples, the average of values from all tuples at that position should be calculated.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is as follows:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

1. **Tuple Unpacking with `zip(*tuples)`**: 
   - The `zip(*tuples)` effectively transposes the input tuples, allowing us to group together all elements at the same index across the tuples.

2. **Calculating Averages**:
   - For each group of values (one from each tuple at the same index), the program computes the sum of those values and divides it by the number of tuples (`len(tuples)`), which correctly computes the average.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty tuple of tuples, `func_1(())` would lead to a division by zero error since `len(tuples)` would be 0.
2. **Single Tuple**: If there is only one tuple, the average should be the values of that tuple itself.
3. **Variable Length Tuples**: If the tuples are of different lengths, the function should ideally handle that, but the current implementation assumes all tuples have the same length.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case of an empty input tuple, which would lead to a division by zero error. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

**Reason**: The program fails to handle the case of an empty input tuple, which results in a division by zero error.
