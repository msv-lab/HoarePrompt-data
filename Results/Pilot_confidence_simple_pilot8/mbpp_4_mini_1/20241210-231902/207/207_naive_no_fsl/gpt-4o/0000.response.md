Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1` to calculate the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The assertions provided test various scenarios, including different lengths and widths, and they all return the expected results. 

1. `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is correct.
2. `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, which is correct.
3. `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, which is correct.

Additionally, the function handles positive integer inputs appropriately. There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. 

Overall, since all tested cases and potential inputs (positive integers) are handled correctly, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
