Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width`. It handles all potential cases, including:

1. Positive values for length and width (e.g., `func_1(5, 10)` returns `50`).
2. Zero as either length or width (e.g., `func_1(0, 10)` returns `0`).
3. Negative values for length or width (e.g., `func_1(-5, 10)` returns `-50`), which may not be a valid scenario for a rectangle area but is still mathematically correct.

Since the function adheres to the problem description for all conceivable inputs, it is considered correct.
