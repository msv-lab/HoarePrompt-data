Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the sorting of strings in the sublists. Specifically, it does not account for leading or trailing whitespace in the strings. For example, the first assertion checks if `func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown']))` returns `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, which is incorrect because the spaces are not removed and thus affect the sorting order. 

A correct implementation should ideally strip the whitespace from each string before sorting. The expected behavior for the input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` should return `[['green', ' red'], ['blue', ' black'], ['brown', 'orange']]` after sorting. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for this case and is therefore incorrect.
