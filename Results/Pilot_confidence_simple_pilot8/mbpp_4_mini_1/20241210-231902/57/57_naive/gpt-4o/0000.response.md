Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. However, it fails to handle leading and trailing spaces in strings correctly. 

For example, consider the input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])`. The expected output should maintain the original order of strings with spaces, but the sorted function will rearrange them based on their trimmed versions, leading to an incorrect output.

The expected output should be:
```
[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
```
However, the program would produce:
```
[[' green ', 'red'], [' black', 'blue '], [' brown', 'orange']]
```

This shows that the program does not correctly sort the sublists while preserving the original structure and spacing of the strings. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
