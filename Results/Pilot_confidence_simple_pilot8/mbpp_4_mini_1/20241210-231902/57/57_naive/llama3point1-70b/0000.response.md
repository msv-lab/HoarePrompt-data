Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower`, which ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. 

Here are a few scenarios to confirm the correctness:

1. For an input like `[["banana", "Apple"], ["orange", "grape"]]`, the output would be `[["Apple", "banana"], ["grape", "orange"]]`, which is the expected sorted order.

2. If the input list contains empty sublists, such as `[[], ["apple"]]`, the output would be `[[], ["apple"]]`, which is also correct.

3. If the input contains mixed cases, such as `[["zebra", "Antelope", "elephant"]]`, the output would be `[["Antelope", "elephant", "zebra"]]`, again confirming that the sorting is case-insensitive.

Since the program handles these cases correctly and adheres to the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases, it is deemed correct.
