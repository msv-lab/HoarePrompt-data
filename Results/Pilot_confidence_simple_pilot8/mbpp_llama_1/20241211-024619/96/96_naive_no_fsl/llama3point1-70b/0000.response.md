Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tup)` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Here's why it works correctly for all potential cases:

- The function uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the type of each element in the tuple.
- It then converts these types into a set. Since sets in Python only store unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same type, the set will contain only one element.
- The function then checks if the length of this set is equal to 1. If it is, that means all elements in the tuple have the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach correctly handles tuples of any size and with elements of any data type, including mixed types. For example:

- `func_1((1, 2, 3))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
- `func_1((1.0, 2.0, 3.0))` returns `True` because all elements are floats.
- `func_1((1, 'a', 3.0))` returns `False` because the elements are of different types (integer, string, float).

Given the simplicity and generality of the function, it correctly implements the described behavior for all possible inputs, making it correct according to the problem description.
