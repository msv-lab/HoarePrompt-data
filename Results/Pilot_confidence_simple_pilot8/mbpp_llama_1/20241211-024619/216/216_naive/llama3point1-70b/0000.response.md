Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. **Sorting the list**: The function first sorts the list in ascending order using `lst.sort()`. This is necessary because the problem statement doesn't assume that the input list is already sorted.

2. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The function then uses the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. This is done using `(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))`. This expression will be `True` only if all pairs of adjacent numbers have a difference of 1.

3. **Checking for duplicates**: The function also checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list using `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`. This is necessary to ensure that there are no duplicate numbers in the list, which would otherwise cause the function to return `True` even if the numbers are not consecutive.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and a list with duplicate numbers. It also correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, regardless of the starting number.

For example, the function will return `True` for the lists `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`, and `[-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]`, and `False` for the lists `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, and `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
