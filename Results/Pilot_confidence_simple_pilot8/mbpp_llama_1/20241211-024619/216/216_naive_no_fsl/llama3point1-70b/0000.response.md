Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's why I believe the code is correct:

1. **Sorting the list**: The function starts by sorting the input list `lst`. This is necessary because the problem statement doesn't specify that the input list must be sorted. By sorting the list, the function ensures that it can check for consecutive numbers regardless of their original order.

2. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The function uses the `all` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list is 1. This is the key condition for a list to contain consecutive numbers.

3. **Checking for duplicates**: The function also checks if the length of the original list is equal to the length of a set created from the list. This is done to ensure that the list doesn't contain any duplicate numbers, which would mean that the numbers are not consecutive.

The function correctly handles various edge cases, such as:

* An empty list: The function will return `True` for an empty list, which might seem counterintuitive. However, the problem statement doesn't explicitly define what should happen in this case. If the intention is to return `False` for an empty list, the function would need to be modified accordingly.
* A list with a single element: The function will return `True` for a list with a single element, which is correct because a single number can be considered as a sequence of consecutive numbers.
* A list with non-integer numbers: The function will work correctly even if the list contains non-integer numbers, such as floats. However, it's worth noting that the concept of consecutive numbers is typically defined for integers.

Overall, the function seems to be correct and handles various edge cases as expected. However, if there's a specific requirement to handle empty lists or non-integer numbers differently, the function might need to be modified accordingly.
