Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns `False`. Then, it sorts the list and iterates over the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair with a difference other than 1, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all pairs without finding such a case, it returns `True`.

This function correctly handles various cases, including:

- An empty list: The function returns `False` as expected.
- A list with consecutive numbers: The function returns `True` as expected.
- A list with non-consecutive numbers: The function returns `False` as expected.
- A list with duplicate numbers: The function returns `False` as expected because the presence of duplicates means the numbers are not consecutive.
- A list with negative numbers or zero: The function will work correctly for these cases as well because it only checks the difference between adjacent numbers.

The function's approach of sorting the list first ensures that it can handle lists where the numbers are not initially in order. This makes the function robust and able to correctly identify consecutive numbers in any list, regardless of the initial order of the numbers. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
