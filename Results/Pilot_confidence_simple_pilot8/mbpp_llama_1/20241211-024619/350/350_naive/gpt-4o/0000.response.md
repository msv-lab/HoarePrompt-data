Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's why:

1. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, which is an efficient way to find the last occurrence of an element.
2. As soon as it finds a match, it returns the index of that element, which is the last position of the element in the array.
3. If the element is not found, it returns -1, which is a common convention to indicate that the element is not present in the array.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function is working correctly:

* `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` returns 0, which is the last (and only) position of 1 in the array.
* `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` returns 2, which is the last position of 1 in the array.
* `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` returns 3, which is the last position of 3 in the array.

After reviewing the code and the unit tests, I couldn't find any potential cases where the function would not work as expected. The function seems to handle all possible scenarios, including:

* Finding the last occurrence of an element in a sorted array.
* Returning -1 if the element is not found.
* Handling arrays with duplicate elements.
* Handling arrays with a single element.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and efficient, and I couldn't find any cases where it would not work as expected.
