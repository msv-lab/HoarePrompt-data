Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates over the array from right to left and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element `x` it encounters. If the element is not found, it returns -1.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, which ensures that the first occurrence of the target element from the right is found.
2. The function returns the index of the target element as soon as it is found, which is the last position of the element in the array.
3. If the target element is not found, the function returns -1, which is a common convention for indicating that an element is not present in the array.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function:

* `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` returns 0, which is the last position of 1 in the array.
* `func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)` returns 2, which is the last position of 1 in the array.
* `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)` returns 3, which is the last position of 3 in the array.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
