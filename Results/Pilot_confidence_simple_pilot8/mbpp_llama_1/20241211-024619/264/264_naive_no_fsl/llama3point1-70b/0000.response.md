Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a simple function that takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The conversion formula used is correct: `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180`. This formula is a standard trigonometric conversion and works for all real numbers.

The function does not include any error checking or handling for non-numeric inputs, but based on the problem description, it is assumed that the input will always be a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. 

The `math` module is imported correctly, and the `math.pi` constant is used as expected.

Since the conversion formula is correct and the function is implemented correctly, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs. There are no apparent edge cases that the program does not handle correctly, such as negative angles or angles greater than 360 degrees, as the conversion formula works for all real numbers. 

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the implementation, the program is correct.
