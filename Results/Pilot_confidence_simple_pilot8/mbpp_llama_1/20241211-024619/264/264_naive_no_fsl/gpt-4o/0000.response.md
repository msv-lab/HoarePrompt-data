Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a simple function that converts degrees to radians. The function `func_1` takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The conversion is done by multiplying the angle in degrees by `math.pi / 180`, which is the correct conversion factor.

The program includes three assert statements that test the function with different inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees). These tests cover a range of possible inputs and verify that the function returns the correct results.

After reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected. The function correctly handles positive angles, and the conversion formula is accurate. Additionally, the `math` module is used to access the `pi` constant, which ensures a precise conversion.

The function does not include any error handling for invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values. However, since the problem description does not specify any requirements for handling such cases, the program can be considered correct within the scope of the given problem.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
