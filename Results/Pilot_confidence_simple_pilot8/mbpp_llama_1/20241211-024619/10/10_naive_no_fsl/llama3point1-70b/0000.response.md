Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is a triangle with base `b` and height `h`. The area of a triangle is given by `b * h / 2`. The function multiplies this area by the length `l` of the prism, which is correct.

The function handles all potential cases correctly. For example, if you call `func_1(2, 3, 4)`, it will return the correct volume of the triangular prism with a base of length 2, a height of 3, and a length of 4.

There are no edge cases that the function does not handle. It correctly calculates the volume for all positive values of `b`, `h`, and `l`. For negative values or zero, the function may not work as expected, but in the context of geometry, these values are not applicable. 

Therefore, based on the problem description, the function is correct and works as expected for all applicable inputs.
