Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height) / 2` for a triangle. In this case, `b` represents the base of the triangle, `h` represents the height of the triangle (not the height of the prism), and `l` represents the length (or height) of the prism.

The function correctly implements this formula as `b * h / 2 * l`, which matches the mathematical definition of the volume of a triangular prism. 

Therefore, for all potential inputs where `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive numbers (which is a reasonable assumption for the dimensions of a triangular prism), the function will correctly calculate the volume. 

There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic in the provided code that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Hence, the program is correct for all valid inputs.
