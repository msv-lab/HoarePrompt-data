Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of length N, where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`. This is achieved by using a generator expression within the `tuple` function to iterate over the indices of the input tuple, multiplying each element with its next one.

The function handles edge cases correctly. For example, when the input tuple has only one element, the function returns an empty tuple, which is the expected output since there are no pairs of adjacent elements to multiply.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios. The function's implementation is straightforward and aligns with the problem description, indicating that it should work correctly for all valid inputs.

The use of `range(len(t) - 1)` ensures that the loop does not attempt to access an index out of bounds, which would occur if it tried to access `t[i + 1]` when `i` is the index of the last element in the tuple. This careful handling of indices further supports the conclusion that the function is correct.
