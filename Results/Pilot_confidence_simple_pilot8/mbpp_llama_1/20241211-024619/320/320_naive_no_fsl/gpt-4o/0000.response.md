Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It successfully finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using the `set()` function and then sorting the unique numbers. If there are at least two unique numbers, it returns the second smallest number; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1.  **Handling duplicates**: The program uses `set(nums)` to remove duplicate numbers from the list. This ensures that each number is only considered once when finding the second smallest number.
2.  **Sorting unique numbers**: The `sorted()` function is used to sort the unique numbers in ascending order. This allows the program to easily identify the second smallest number.
3.  **Edge cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are less than two unique numbers in the list. In these cases, it returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the program's correctness, covering various scenarios, including:

*   Lists with multiple unique numbers
*   Lists with duplicate numbers
*   Lists with less than two unique numbers

Overall, the program is well-structured and correctly implements the required functionality, making it correct according to the problem description.
