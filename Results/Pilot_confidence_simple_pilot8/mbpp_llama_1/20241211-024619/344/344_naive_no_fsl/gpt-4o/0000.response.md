Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. This function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function works as follows:

- If the value is already present in the list, it returns the index of the first occurrence of the value to its right. If the value is not present, it returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is the correct insertion point for the value `6` to maintain the sorted order.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is the correct insertion point for the value `3` to maintain the sorted order.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, which is the correct insertion point for the value `7` to maintain the sorted order.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is designed to find the insertion point for a value in a sorted list, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
