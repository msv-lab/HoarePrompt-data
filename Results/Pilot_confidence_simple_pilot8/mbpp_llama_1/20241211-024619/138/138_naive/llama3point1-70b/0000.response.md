Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It uses the built-in `index` method of Python lists to find the index of the given element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught and handled by returning a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* When the element is present in the array, it returns the correct index.
* When the element is not present in the array, it returns `(False, -1)`.
* When the array is empty, it correctly raises a `ValueError` exception and returns `(False, -1)`.
* When the element is `None` or any other type of object, it works as expected.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
