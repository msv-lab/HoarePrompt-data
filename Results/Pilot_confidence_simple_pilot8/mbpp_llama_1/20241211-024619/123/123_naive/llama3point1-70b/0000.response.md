Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple contains the first `L` elements of the input list, and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The function uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. The expression `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing all elements of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- When `L` is equal to the length of the input list, the function returns a tuple containing the original list and an empty list.
- When `L` is greater than the length of the input list, the function returns a tuple containing the original list and an empty list, because `lst[L:]` returns an empty list when `L` exceeds the length of `lst`.
- When `L` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns a tuple containing an empty list and the original list, because `lst[:L]` returns an empty list when `L` is less than or equal to 0.

The function handles all edge cases correctly and does not throw any exceptions for valid inputs. Therefore, the function is correct according to the provided problem description.
