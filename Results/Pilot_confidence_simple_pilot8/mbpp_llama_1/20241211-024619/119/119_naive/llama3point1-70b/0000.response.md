Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with the second number `b` and then the first number `a`. This is exactly what the problem description requires. 

The function works correctly for all possible inputs, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. It also works correctly for non-integer inputs, such as floats. 

For example, `func_1(1, 2)` returns `(2, 1)`, `func_1(-1, 0)` returns `(0, -1)`, and `func_1(3.5, 2.8)` returns `(2.8, 3.5)`. 

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs, it is correct.
