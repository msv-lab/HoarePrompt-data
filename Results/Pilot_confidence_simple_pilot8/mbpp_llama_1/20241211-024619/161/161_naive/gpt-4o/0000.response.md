Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(n)` calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1, instead of 0 and 1.

The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number. It starts with the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and then uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number for `n` greater than 1.

The loop initializes two variables `a` and `b` to the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1), and then iteratively updates these variables to calculate the next Lucas number in the sequence.

The function returns the n'th Lucas number, which is stored in the variable `b` after the loop finishes.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) confirm that the function works correctly for `n` equal to 9, 4, and 3.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles the base cases and the recursive case, and the loop iterates the correct number of times to calculate the n'th Lucas number.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct, and it will produce the correct result for any valid input `n`.
