Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a series of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point: 2 and 1, instead of 0 and 1. The program correctly implements this sequence.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Iterative Approach**: For `n > 1`, the program uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number. It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). Then, it iteratively updates these variables to hold the last two numbers in the sequence, effectively calculating each subsequent number as the sum of the previous two.

3. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive), ensuring that the n'th Lucas number is correctly calculated.

4. **Return Value**: After the loop completes, the program returns `b`, which holds the n'th Lucas number.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly calculate the n'th Lucas number for all non-negative integers `n`. Without a specific counterexample where the program fails to produce the correct Lucas number, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for its intended purpose.
