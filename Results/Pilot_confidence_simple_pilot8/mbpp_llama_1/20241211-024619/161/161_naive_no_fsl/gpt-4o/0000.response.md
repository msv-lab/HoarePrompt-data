Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting numbers: 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The program uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number, which is more efficient than a recursive approach for large values of n.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Base cases**: The program correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1, respectively.
2. **Iterative calculation**: The program uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number. It initializes two variables, a and b, to the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). Then, it iteratively updates a and b to the next two numbers in the sequence, effectively calculating the n'th Lucas number.
3. **Return value**: The program returns the correct value, which is the n'th Lucas number.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7`, demonstrate that the program works correctly for different inputs.

After analyzing the program, I couldn't find any potential cases where it would not work as expected. The program correctly handles the base cases, and the iterative calculation is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
