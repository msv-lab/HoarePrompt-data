Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

Here's why it works:

- It first converts the integer into a string to easily iterate over each digit.
- It then creates a dictionary `frequency` to store the frequency of each digit in the integer.
- It iterates over each digit in the string representation of the integer. If the digit is already in the `frequency` dictionary, it increments the count; otherwise, it adds the digit to the dictionary with a count of 1.
- Finally, it checks each digit in the `frequency` dictionary. If the count of any digit is greater than the digit itself, it returns `False`. If it checks all digits without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the program. 

For example, `func_1(1234)` returns `True` because the frequency of each digit (1, 2, 3, 4) is 1, which is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

On the other hand, `func_1(51241)` returns `False` because the frequency of digit 1 is 2, which is greater than the digit itself.

After reviewing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
