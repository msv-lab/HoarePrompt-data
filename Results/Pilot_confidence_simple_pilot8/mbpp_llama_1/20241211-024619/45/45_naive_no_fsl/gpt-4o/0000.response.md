Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number where the digits alternate between two values. 

The program first converts the number to a string to easily access each digit. It then checks if the length of the string is less than 3, in which case it returns `False` because an undulating number must have at least three digits to alternate between two values.

Next, it checks if the first two digits are the same. If they are, it returns `False` because an undulating number must start with two different digits.

Finally, it iterates over the rest of the digits in the string. If the index of the digit is even, it checks if the digit is equal to the first digit. If the index is odd, it checks if the digit is equal to the second digit. If it finds a digit that does not match the expected value, it returns `False`.

If the function finishes checking all the digits without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1(1212121)` returns `True` because the digits alternate between 1 and 2, and `func_1(1991)` returns `False` because the digits do not alternate between two values.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
