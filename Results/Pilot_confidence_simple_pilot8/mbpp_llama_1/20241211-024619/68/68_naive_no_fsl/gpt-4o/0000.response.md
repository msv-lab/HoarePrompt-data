Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

The program includes three assertions to test the function with different inputs. These assertions check if the calculated angle is close to the expected value within a relative tolerance of 0.001.

After analyzing the code, it appears to be correct and follows the problem description. The `cmath.phase` function is a built-in Python function that returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment connecting the origin to the point represented by the complex number.

The function handles different cases correctly, including:

* Complex numbers with a non-zero real part and a non-zero imaginary part.
* Complex numbers with a zero real part and a non-zero imaginary part (i.e., purely imaginary numbers).
* Complex numbers with a non-zero real part and a zero imaginary part (i.e., purely real numbers), although this case is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions.

Since the `cmath.phase` function is a standard library function, it is expected to handle edge cases correctly, such as complex numbers with very large or very small magnitudes.

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, it appears that the program is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
