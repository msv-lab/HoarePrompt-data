Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(month)` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. It does this by defining a list `thirty_days_months` that includes the month numbers of April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are the months that have 30 days in the Gregorian calendar. The function then returns `True` if the input `month` is in this list and `False` otherwise.

This function correctly handles all potential cases for month numbers from 1 to 12. For the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November), it returns `True`, and for the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) or the months with fewer than 30 days (February), it returns `False`. 

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs (month numbers from 1 to 12), and there are no edge cases that the function does not handle correctly, the program is correct.
