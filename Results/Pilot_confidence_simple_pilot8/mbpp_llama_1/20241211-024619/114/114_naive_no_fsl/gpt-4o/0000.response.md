Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

The function works as expected for all potential cases, including when the element is present multiple times, present only once, or not present at all in the tuple. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for these scenarios.

The function does not have any apparent edge cases that it does not handle correctly. It works with tuples of any size, and it correctly handles elements of any data type that can be compared for equality.

For example, the following test cases also work as expected:
```python
print(func_1((1, 2, 3), 1))  # Output: 1
print(func_1((1, 2, 3), 4))  # Output: 0
print(func_1((), 1))  # Output: 0
print(func_1((1, 1, 1), 1))  # Output: 3
```
Overall, the function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
