Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly counts the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The `count()` method in Python returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple. 

This function will work correctly for all potential cases, including:

- When the element is present in the tuple multiple times
- When the element is present in the tuple only once
- When the element is not present in the tuple (returns 0)
- When the tuple is empty (returns 0)
- When the element is of any data type (e.g., integer, string, float)

For example, `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), 2)` will return `2`, `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)` will return `0`, and `func_1((), 1)` will return `0`. 

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and does not have any missing logic or edge cases, it is considered correct.
