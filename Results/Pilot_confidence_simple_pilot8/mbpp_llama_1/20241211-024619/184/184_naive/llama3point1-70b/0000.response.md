Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that filters out even numbers from a given list of numbers and returns a list of odd numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `nums` and includes a number in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`).

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Empty input list: The function returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
* List with only even numbers: The function returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
* List with only odd numbers: The function returns the original list, which is the expected result.
* List with a mix of even and odd numbers: The function returns a list containing only the odd numbers, which is the expected result.
* List with duplicate numbers: The function returns a list containing all the odd numbers, including duplicates, which is the expected result.
* List with negative numbers: The function works correctly with negative numbers, returning a list of odd numbers.
* List with zero: The function considers zero as an even number and does not include it in the output list, which is the expected result.

Since the function works correctly for all these cases and does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
