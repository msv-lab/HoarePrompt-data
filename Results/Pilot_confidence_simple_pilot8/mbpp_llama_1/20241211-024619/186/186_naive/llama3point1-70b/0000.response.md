Correctness: **False**.

The given function `func_1` is attempting to extract the element-wise AND operation between two tuples. However, the problem description asks for both element-wise and tuples, but the function only performs the element-wise AND operation using the bitwise AND operator `&`. 

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the tuples contain non-integer values. For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = ('a', 'b', 'c')`, the function will throw an error because it's trying to perform a bitwise AND operation between an integer and a string.

Another case where the program does not work correctly is when the tuples are of different lengths. The `zip` function will stop once the shortest input iterable is exhausted, so the function will not handle tuples of different lengths as expected.

To correctly implement the function, it should handle both element-wise operations and return tuples, and it should also handle tuples of different lengths and non-integer values. 

For example, a correct implementation could be:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    result = []
    for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2):
        result.append((x, y))
    return tuple(result)
```
This function will return a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the corresponding elements from the input tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop once the shortest input iterable is exhausted.
