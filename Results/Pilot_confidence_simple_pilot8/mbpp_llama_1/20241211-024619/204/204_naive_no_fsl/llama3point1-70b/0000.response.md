Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a month number `n` as input and checks if it is in the list of months that have 31 days. The months with 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

The program correctly handles all potential cases. For example, if you call `func_1(1)`, it returns `True` because January has 31 days. If you call `func_1(2)`, it returns `False` because February does not have 31 days.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases. It correctly handles all month numbers from 1 to 12 and returns the expected result. It also handles invalid inputs (e.g., `func_1(13)`) correctly by returning `False`, although it does not explicitly check for invalid inputs.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
