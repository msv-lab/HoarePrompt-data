Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program defines a function `func_1(n)` that checks whether a given month number `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days. The function uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. It then checks if the input month number `n` is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This program correctly handles all possible cases:

- For month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, the function returns `True`, as these months have 31 days.
- For month numbers 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, the function returns `False`, as these months have fewer than 31 days.
- The function also correctly handles invalid month numbers (i.e., numbers outside the range 1-12), as it will return `False` for these inputs.

The program does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. It is a simple and efficient solution that meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
