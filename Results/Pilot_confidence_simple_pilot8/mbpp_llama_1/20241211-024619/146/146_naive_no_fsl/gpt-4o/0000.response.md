Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list, which will be used to keep track of the longest list found so far.
2. It iterates through each list in the input list of lists.
3. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list is greater than `max_len`. If it is, it updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and sets `max_list` to the current list.
4. After iterating through all lists, it returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`, which represent the length and the longest list, respectively.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as:

* An empty input list of lists: In this case, `max_len` remains 0, and `max_list` remains an empty list, which is the expected output.
* A list of lists with multiple lists of the same maximum length: In this case, the program returns the first list it encounters with the maximum length, which is a valid solution.
* A list of lists with a single list: In this case, the program returns the length and the single list, which is the expected output.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It handles all potential cases and edge cases correctly, and it returns the expected output for the provided test cases.
