Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but the program only returns the first sublist with the maximum length, not all sublists with the maximum length.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])` because both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` have the maximum length.

To fix this, the program should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected program would be:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
