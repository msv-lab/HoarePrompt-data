Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively, and then returns their difference.

This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be between the largest and smallest elements. By subtracting the smallest element from the largest, the function effectively calculates this maximum difference.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- Empty arrays: Although not explicitly handled, an empty array would raise a `ValueError` when trying to find the `max` or `min` value, which is a reasonable behavior since the concept of maximum difference does not apply to an empty set of numbers.
- Arrays with a single element: The `max` and `min` of such an array would be the same element, resulting in a difference of 0, which is correct.
- Arrays with duplicate maximum or minimum values: The function still correctly identifies the maximum and minimum values and calculates their difference.
- Arrays with negative numbers: The function correctly handles negative numbers, as the `max` and `min` functions work with negative numbers.

Since the function correctly handles all these cases and the logic is sound, the program is considered correct.
