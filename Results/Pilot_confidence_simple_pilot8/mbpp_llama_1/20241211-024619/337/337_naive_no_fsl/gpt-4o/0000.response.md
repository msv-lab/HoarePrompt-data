Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The issue lies in the fact that it uses a set to remove duplicates, but this approach does not account for the actual count of each element in the original list. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, the program will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is correct. However, if the input list is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3]`, the program will still return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is also correct. But if the input list is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, the program will return `1 + 2 = 3`, which is correct.

However, the problem arises when we consider a list where an element appears more than once but we still want to consider it as a repeated element and exclude it from the sum. For instance, if the input list is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, the program will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is incorrect because `1` and `3` are repeated elements and should be excluded from the sum.

A correct implementation would involve counting the occurrences of each element and only including elements that appear once in the sum. 

Here's an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(key for key, value in count_dict.items() if value == 1)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a list by counting the occurrences of each element and only including elements that appear once in the sum.
