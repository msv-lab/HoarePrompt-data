Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, it simply returns the sum of unique elements in the list, which is not the same as the sum of non-repeated elements.

A non-repeated element is an element that appears only once in the list. The given program does not check for this condition. It simply removes duplicates from the list and sums up the remaining elements.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, the sum of non-repeated elements should be `1`, because `1` is the only element that appears only once in the list. However, the given program will return `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`, which is incorrect.

To correctly implement the problem description, the function should count the occurrences of each element in the list and then sum up the elements that appear only once. Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    return sum(num for num, count in count_dict.items() if count == 1)
```
