Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function first merges the two input lists into a single list, sorts it, and then calculates the median based on whether the total length of the merged list is even or odd.

Here's why the code works correctly:

1. **Merging and Sorting**: The function correctly merges the two input lists using `list1 + list2` and sorts the resulting list using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the elements are in ascending order, which is necessary for calculating the median.

2. **Calculating Median**:
   - For an even-length merged list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The function calculates this correctly by taking the average of `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`.
   - For an odd-length merged list, the median is the middle number itself. The function correctly identifies this as `merged_list[mid]`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function implicitly handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, as the `sorted()` function and the median calculation logic will work correctly for these cases as well. However, it's worth noting that the function does not explicitly check for these edge cases, but the provided unit tests and the nature of the function suggest that it is designed to work with non-empty lists of the same size.

4. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that the input lists are sorted and of the same size, as specified in the problem description. While it does not validate these assumptions, the provided unit tests and the context of the problem suggest that this is a reasonable assumption.

Given the provided unit tests and the logic of the function, it appears to correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Without additional information or counterexamples, it seems that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
