Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function `func_1(n)` converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts it back into an integer, and sums them all up.

This approach works correctly for all non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and zero. For example, `func_1(123)` correctly returns `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, and `func_1(0)` correctly returns `0`.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

- Single-digit numbers: The function works as expected, returning the number itself since it only has one digit.
- Multi-digit numbers: The function correctly sums up all the digits.
- Zero: The function returns `0`, which is the sum of the digits of `0`.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct.
