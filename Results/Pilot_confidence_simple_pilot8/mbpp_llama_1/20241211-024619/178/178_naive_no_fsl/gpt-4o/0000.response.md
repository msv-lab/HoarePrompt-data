Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer using the `round` function, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. 

The program handles both positive and negative numbers, as well as integers and floating-point numbers, correctly. It also handles lists of varying lengths. The unit tests provided demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

The code is concise, readable, and well-structured, making it easy to understand and verify its correctness. The list comprehension used to round the numbers is a efficient and Pythonic way to perform this operation. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers, and the result is multiplied by the length of the input list.

Since the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases as described in the problem, it is considered correct.
