Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement a sorting function. The main issue lies in the scope and usage of the global variable `arr`. 

In the `func_1` function, `arr` is not defined within the function's scope. The function parameters include `arr`, but it is not used correctly within the function. The `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are also trying to access `arr` as a global variable, which is not defined in the provided code.

Another issue is that the `find_max_index` function is called with a parameter `n`, which seems to represent the size of the array. However, this function should be called with the current size of the array that is being processed, not just the size of the array.

Lastly, the `flip` function is used to reverse the array from the start to the `end` index. However, the `end` index is not correctly calculated in the `func_1` function.

To fix these issues, the `arr` parameter should be used consistently throughout the functions, and the `find_max_index` function should be called with the correct parameters.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

If we call `func_1([5, 2, 8, 1, 9])`, the program will throw an error because `arr` is not defined in the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions.

A correct implementation of the sorting function would be:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(arr, curr_size)
        if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(arr, max_index, curr_size - 1)
    return arr

def flip(arr, i, j):
    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

def find_max_index(arr, n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
```
