Correctness: **False**.

The given program attempts to sort a list of elements using a modified version of the pancake sort algorithm. However, the implementation is incorrect because the `arr` variable is not defined within the scope of the functions `flip` and `find_max_index`. 

In Python, variables that are defined inside a function are local to that function by default. To access the `arr` variable from the `func_1` function, it should be passed as an argument to the `flip` and `find_max_index` functions.

Additionally, the `flip` function modifies the `arr` list in place, but it does not check if the `start` index is less than the `end` index before swapping elements. This could potentially lead to incorrect results if the `start` index is greater than the `end` index.

A correct implementation of the pancake sort algorithm would require passing the `arr` variable as an argument to the `flip` and `find_max_index` functions, and also checking the indices before swapping elements.

For example, the program will fail for the input `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]` because the `arr` variable is not defined within the scope of the `flip` and `find_max_index` functions. 

To fix this issue, the `arr` variable should be passed as an argument to the `flip` and `find_max_index` functions, like this:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(arr, curr_size)
        if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(arr, max_index)
            flip(arr, curr_size - 1)
    return arr

def flip(arr, end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1

def find_max_index(arr, n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all inputs.
