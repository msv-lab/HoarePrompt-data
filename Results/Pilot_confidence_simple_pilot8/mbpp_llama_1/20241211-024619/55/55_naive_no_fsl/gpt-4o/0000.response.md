Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly convert a snake case string to camel case string. In camel case, the first word is typically in lowercase, while the rest of the words are capitalized. However, the provided function capitalizes the first word as well.

For example, if the input is 'hello_world', the expected output in camel case should be 'helloWorld', but the function will return 'HelloWorld'. 

To fix this, the function should capitalize all words except the first one. Here's an example of how the corrected function could look like:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join((x.capitalize() for x in components[1:]))
```

This corrected function will return the expected camel case string.
