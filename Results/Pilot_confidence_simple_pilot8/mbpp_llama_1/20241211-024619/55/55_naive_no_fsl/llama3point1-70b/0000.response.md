Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly convert a snake case string to a camel case string. In camel case, the first word should be in lowercase, and the subsequent words should be capitalized. However, the given program capitalizes all words, including the first one.

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the expected output should be "helloWorld", but the program will output "HelloWorld". 

To fix this, the program should only capitalize the words after the first one. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words[1:]))
    return camel_case_str
```
