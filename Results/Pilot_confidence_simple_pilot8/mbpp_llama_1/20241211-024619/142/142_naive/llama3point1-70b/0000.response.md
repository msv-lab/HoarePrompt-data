Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It uses the built-in `all()` function in Python, which returns `True` if all elements in an iterable are true. The iterable in this case is a generator expression that checks whether each item in the list is equal to the given element.

This function will work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the list is empty, `all()` will return `True` because there are no elements that are not equal to the given element. If the list contains multiple elements that are all equal to the given element, `all()` will return `True`. If the list contains at least one element that is not equal to the given element, `all()` will return `False`.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function:

```python
print(func_1([1, 1, 1], 1))  # True
print(func_1([1, 2, 1], 1))  # False
print(func_1([], 1))  # True
print(func_1([1], 1))  # True
print(func_1([1], 2))  # False
```

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
