Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The `zip(tup1, tup2)` function is used to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression is used to calculate the differences between corresponding elements.

The function will work correctly for any two tuples of the same length, containing numeric elements. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, which is the expected behavior for the `zip` function in Python.

For example, `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))` will return `(-3, -3, -3)`, which is the expected result.

It's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking to ensure that the tuples contain only numeric elements or that they are of the same length. However, based on the problem description, it appears that these are assumptions that can be made about the input. If these assumptions are not valid, additional error checking would be necessary to make the function more robust.
