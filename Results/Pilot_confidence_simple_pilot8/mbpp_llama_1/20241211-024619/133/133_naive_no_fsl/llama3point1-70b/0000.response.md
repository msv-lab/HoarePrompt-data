Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`.

The `zip(tup1, tup2)` expression pairs up the elements from `tup1` and `tup2` based on their index, and the generator expression `(a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2))` calculates the difference between each pair of elements. The `tuple()` function then converts this generator expression into a tuple, which is returned by the function.

This implementation correctly handles tuples of any length, as long as they are the same length. If the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip()` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which is the expected behavior in this case.

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the function will return `(-3, -3, -3)`, which is the expected result. Similarly, if we call `func_1((10, 20), (5, 10))`, the function will return `(5, 10)`, which is also correct.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
