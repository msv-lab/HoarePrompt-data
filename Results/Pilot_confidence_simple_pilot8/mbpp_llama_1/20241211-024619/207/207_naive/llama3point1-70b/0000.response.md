Correctness: **True**.

The given program is a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. This function works correctly for all positive values of length and width, which are the typical inputs for calculating the area of a rectangle. 

The function does not include any error checking to handle cases where the inputs might be negative or non-numeric, but based on the problem description, it seems that the function is intended to work with valid inputs (i.e., positive numbers). 

However, it's worth noting that in a real-world application, you might want to add some error checking to handle potential edge cases, such as negative numbers or non-numeric inputs. But based solely on the provided problem description and the given code, the function appears to be correct. 

For example, if you call `func_1(5, 6)`, the function will return `30`, which is the correct area of a rectangle with a length of 5 and a width of 6. Similarly, if you call `func_1(10, 2)`, the function will return `20`, which is again the correct area. 

Without any additional information or constraints, it seems that the function works as expected for all valid inputs, so I conclude that the program is correct.
