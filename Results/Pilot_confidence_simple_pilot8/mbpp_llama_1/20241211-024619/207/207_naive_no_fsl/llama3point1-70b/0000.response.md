Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(length, width)` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. This function works for all positive numeric inputs, which is the typical domain for rectangle dimensions. 

The function does not include any error checking or handling for non-numeric or negative inputs, but based on the problem description alone, which simply asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, the provided code meets the requirements. It correctly performs the calculation as expected for valid rectangle dimensions (positive numbers).

However, it's worth noting that in a more robust implementation, you might want to add checks to ensure that both length and width are positive numbers, as negative values or non-numeric inputs would not make sense in the context of geometric shapes like rectangles. But strictly following the given problem description and the provided code, the function works as intended for all valid cases of rectangle dimensions.
