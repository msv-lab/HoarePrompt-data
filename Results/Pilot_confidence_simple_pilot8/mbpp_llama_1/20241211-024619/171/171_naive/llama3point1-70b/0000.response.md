Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. It uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function works correctly for all integer inputs, including positive, negative, and zero. For example:

- `func_1(3)` returns `True` because 3 is an odd number.
- `func_1(4)` returns `False` because 4 is an even number.
- `func_1(-3)` returns `True` because -3 is an odd number.
- `func_1(0)` returns `False` because 0 is an even number.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, and there are no edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
