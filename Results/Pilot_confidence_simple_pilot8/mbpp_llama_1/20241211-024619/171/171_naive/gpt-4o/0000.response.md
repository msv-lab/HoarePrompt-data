Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is even.

This logic aligns with the definition of odd and even numbers: an odd number is any integer that cannot be exactly divided by 2, while an even number can be exactly divided by 2. The function handles all potential cases correctly, including positive and negative integers, as the modulus operator in Python works with both positive and negative numbers.

For example, `func_1(12)` returns `False` because 12 is an even number, and `func_1(7)` returns `True` because 7 is an odd number. The function also correctly handles negative numbers, as the parity of a negative number is the same as its absolute value. For instance, `func_1(-7)` would return `True` because -7 is an odd number.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to determine the parity of any given integer and handles all potential cases as expected, it is considered correct.
