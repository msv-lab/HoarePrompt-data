Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, takes a list and an integer `n` as input and splits the list into `n` sublists, where each sublist contains every `n`th element from the original list, starting from the corresponding index.

The function uses list comprehension to initialize `n` empty sublists and then iterates over the input list using `enumerate`. For each element, it calculates the index of the sublist where the element should be appended using the modulo operator (`i % n`). This ensures that the elements are distributed evenly across the sublists.

The function handles various input cases correctly, including:

* Lists of different lengths and types of elements
* Different values of `n`, including edge cases like `n = 1` or `n = len(lst)`

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios. After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any examples where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
