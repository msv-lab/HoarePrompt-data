Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula `V = (1/3) * π * r^2 * h`, where `r` is the radius of the cone's base and `h` is the height of the cone. This formula is a standard mathematical formula for calculating the volume of a cone.

The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are used to calculate the volume. The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the mathematical constant π.

The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as negative values for `radius` or `height`, but in the context of calculating the volume of a cone, these values would not make physical sense. The function assumes that the input values are valid and will produce a correct result for any non-negative values of `radius` and `height`.

Since the function correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone and does not contain any obvious errors, it is considered correct. 

However, it's worth noting that the function does not include any error checking or handling for invalid input values, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, this might be considered a limitation or an error. But based solely on the provided code and problem description, the function appears to be correct.
