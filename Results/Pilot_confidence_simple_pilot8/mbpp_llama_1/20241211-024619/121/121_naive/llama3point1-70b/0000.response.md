Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be correct for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Here's a breakdown of why it seems correct:

1. **Prime checking function (`func_1`):** This function correctly checks if a number is prime. It iterates up to the square root of the number, which is an optimization for prime checking, and returns `False` as soon as it finds a divisor.

2. **Newman-Shanks-Williams prime finding function (`func_2`):** This function starts with the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is 7, and then increments a counter each time it finds a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. This is the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

3. **Handling of edge cases:** The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by immediately returning 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

4. **General case handling:** For `n > 1`, the function enters a loop where it checks each number starting from 7 to see if it is prime and if it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. If both conditions are met, it increments the counter. Once the counter equals `n`, it returns the current number, which is the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

Since the program correctly implements the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes and handles all potential cases, including edge cases, it appears to be correct. Without finding a specific case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
