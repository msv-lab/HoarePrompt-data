Correctness: **False**.

The program provided is not a correct implementation of a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers that can be generated using a specific formula, but the provided program appears to be generating a sequence of numbers using a recursive formula that resembles the Fibonacci sequence.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function is expected to return the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but the values returned by the function do not match the known values of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.

For example, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are 7, 17, 41, 239, 9369319,.... However, the provided function returns 1 for n = 0 or n = 1, which is not a prime number, and the subsequent values returned by the function do not match the known values of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.

A correct implementation of a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number would require a different approach, such as using a primality test to generate prime numbers and checking if they satisfy the conditions of the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when n = 0, the function returns 1, which is not a prime number.
