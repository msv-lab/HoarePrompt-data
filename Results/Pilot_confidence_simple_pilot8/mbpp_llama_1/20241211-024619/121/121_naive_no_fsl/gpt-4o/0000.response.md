Correctness: **False**

The given program does not implement the function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number as described in the problem statement. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are a sequence of prime numbers defined by the recurrence relation: 

NSW(1) = 7 
NSW(n) = 2 * NSW(n-1)^2 - 1 

However, the provided program implements a different recurrence relation, which seems to be related to the Fibonacci sequence or a similar sequence, but it is not the correct recurrence relation for the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers.

For example, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers are 7, 17, 41, 239, 9369319, but the provided program does not generate these numbers. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is considered incorrect.
