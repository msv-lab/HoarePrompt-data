Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct. It meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
2. It then iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
4. If `i` is even, it calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the `sum`.
5. After the loop finishes, the function returns the calculated `sum`.

The code correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When `n` is 0, the function returns 1, which is the correct sum of even index binomial coefficients (i.e., `math.comb(0, 0)`).
* When `n` is a positive integer, the function correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
* The code does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle correctly.

Since I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
