Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of `n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`.

This property can be understood by considering the binomial expansion of `(1 + 1)^n`, which is equal to `2^n`. The binomial coefficients of this expansion are the coefficients of the terms in the expansion. When we expand `(1 + 1)^n`, we get:

`(1 + 1)^n = 1 + n + n*(n-1)/2 +... + 1`

The sum of the even index binomial coefficients is the sum of the coefficients of the terms with even powers of `1`, which is equal to `2^(n-1)`.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this property by simply returning `2^(n-1)`.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(4) == 8`, `assert func_1(6) == 32`, and `assert func_1(2) == 2`, also validate the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the mathematical property and the provided unit tests, it appears that the function `func_1(n)` is correct and works as expected for all positive integer inputs `n`.
