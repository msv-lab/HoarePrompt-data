Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates over the list, comparing each element with the next one. If it finds a pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next one, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration without finding such a pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly identifies sorted lists, as shown in the first assertion.
- It correctly identifies unsorted lists, as shown in the second and third assertions.
- It handles lists of varying lengths and with different elements.
- It does not have any edge cases that are not handled, such as empty lists or lists with a single element, as these are implicitly handled by the loop condition.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
