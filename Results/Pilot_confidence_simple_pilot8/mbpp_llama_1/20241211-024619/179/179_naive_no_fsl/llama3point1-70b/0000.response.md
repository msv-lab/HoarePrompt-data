Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function uses a generator expression to generate the cube of each even number from 2 to `n * 2` (inclusive).
2. The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` function generates even numbers starting from 2 and ending at `n * 2`.
3. The `sum` function then adds up the cubes of these even numbers.

For example, if `n = 3`, the function will calculate the cube sum of the first 3 even natural numbers: 2, 4, and 6.

`func_1(3)` = `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3` = `8 + 64 + 216` = `288`

This function works correctly for all positive integer values of `n`. It correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` and returns the cube of the first even natural number, which is `2^3 = 8`.

There are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
