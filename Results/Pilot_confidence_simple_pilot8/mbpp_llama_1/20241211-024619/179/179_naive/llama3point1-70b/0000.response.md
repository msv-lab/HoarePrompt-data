Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a generator expression to calculate the cube of each even number from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) and then sums up these cubes.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly:

1. The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n`. This correctly identifies the first `n` even natural numbers.
2. The expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` calculates the cube of each even number in the sequence.
3. The `sum(...)` function adds up all the cubes calculated in the previous step.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When `n` is 1, the function correctly calculates the cube of the first even natural number, which is 2^3 = 8.
* When `n` is greater than 1, the function correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
* The function also handles the case when `n` is 0, although the problem description does not explicitly state what should happen in this case. In this case, the function returns 0, which is a reasonable result since the sum of an empty set of numbers is 0.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
