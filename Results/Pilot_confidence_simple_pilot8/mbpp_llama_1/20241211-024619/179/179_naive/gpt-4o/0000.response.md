Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. It calculates the cube of each number in the list using a generator expression: `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
3. It sums up the cubes using the built-in `sum()` function.

The function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Positive integers: The function works correctly for all positive integers `n`.
* Edge cases: The function handles edge cases, such as `n = 1`, correctly.

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, and `assert func_1(4) == 800` also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the function.

Overall, the function correctly implements the problem description, and I couldn't find any potential case where it doesn't work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
