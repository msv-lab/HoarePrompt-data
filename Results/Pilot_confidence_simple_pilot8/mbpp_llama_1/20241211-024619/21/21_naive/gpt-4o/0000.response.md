Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function works correctly for all potential cases, including lists with negative numbers, duplicate smallest numbers, and lists with a single element.

Here are some examples that demonstrate the correctness of the function:

* `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number in the list.
* `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number in the list.
* `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, which is the smallest number in the list.
* `func_1([-10, -20, -1, -45, -99])` returns `-99`, which is the smallest number in the list.
* `func_1([5])` returns `5`, which is the smallest (and only) number in the list.

The function also handles edge cases, such as an empty list, by raising a `ValueError` exception, which is the expected behavior for the `min` function.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description and works as expected for all potential cases.
