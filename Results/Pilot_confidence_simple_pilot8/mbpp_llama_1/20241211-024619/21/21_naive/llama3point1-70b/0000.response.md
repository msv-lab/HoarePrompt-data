Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to handle lists of numbers and will return the smallest number in the list.

Here are some cases to consider:

- **Empty list**: If the input list is empty, the `min` function will raise a `ValueError` because there is no smallest element in an empty list. However, this is a reasonable behavior given the problem description, as the concept of a smallest number does not apply to an empty set of numbers.
- **List with a single element**: If the list contains only one number, the function will correctly return that number as the smallest.
- **List with multiple elements**: For lists with multiple numbers, the `min` function will correctly identify and return the smallest number.
- **List with duplicate smallest numbers**: If there are multiple instances of the smallest number in the list, the `min` function will still return the correct smallest number.
- **List with negative numbers**: The function also correctly handles lists containing negative numbers, identifying the smallest number regardless of whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

Given these cases and the design of the `min` function, it appears that `func_1` correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases, assuming that the input is a non-empty list of numbers. If the input can be empty or not a list of numbers, additional error checking might be necessary to handle those cases, but based on the provided problem description and code, the function works as expected.
