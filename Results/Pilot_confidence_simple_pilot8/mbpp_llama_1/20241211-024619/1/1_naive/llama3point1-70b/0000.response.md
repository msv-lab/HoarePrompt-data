Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists (which are actually tuples in this case). It uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to achieve this.

Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly:

1. The function takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, as input.
2. It converts these tuples into sets using the `set()` function. This allows for the use of set operations.
3. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives a new set containing only the elements that are common to both sets.
4. The result is converted back into a tuple using the `tuple()` function and returned.

This approach correctly identifies the shared elements between the two input tuples. It handles cases where there are no shared elements (returning an empty tuple), as well as cases where there are one or more shared elements.

It's also worth noting that this function is case-sensitive and considers 'a' and 'A' as different elements. Additionally, it does not preserve the original order of elements, as sets are unordered in Python. However, these characteristics are not explicitly mentioned as requirements in the problem description, so the function can be considered correct based on the given information. 

For example, if you call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5))`, the function will correctly return `(3,)`. If you call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the function will correctly return `()`. 

Overall, the function appears to work correctly for all potential cases, so its correctness is **True**.
