Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists. It uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to identify common elements between the two lists, and then converts the resulting set back into a tuple, sorting the elements in ascending order.

The function works correctly for all potential cases because it:

1. Handles duplicate elements: Since sets automatically eliminate duplicates, the function will only return each shared element once, even if it appears multiple times in either list.
2. Handles empty lists: If either list is empty, the set intersection will be an empty set, and the function will return an empty tuple.
3. Handles lists with no common elements: If the lists have no common elements, the set intersection will be an empty set, and the function will return an empty tuple.
4. Handles lists with different lengths: The function works correctly regardless of the lengths of the input lists.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios. Since no potential case can be found where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
