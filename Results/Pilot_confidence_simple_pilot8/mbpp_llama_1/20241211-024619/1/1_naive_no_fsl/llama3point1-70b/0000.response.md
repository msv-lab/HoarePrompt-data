Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input and returns a tuple containing the shared elements from the two input tuples. 

The function uses the set intersection operation `&` to find the common elements between the two tuples. The `set()` function is used to convert the tuples into sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. The `&` operator then returns a new set containing only the elements that are present in both sets. Finally, the `tuple()` function is used to convert the resulting set back into a tuple.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the shared elements from the two input tuples, regardless of their order or duplicates. 

For example, if `test_tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 2)` and `test_tup2 = (2, 3, 4)`, the function will return `(2, 3)`, which are the shared elements between the two tuples.

The function handles edge cases such as:

- Empty tuples: If either `test_tup1` or `test_tup2` is an empty tuple, the function will return an empty tuple.
- Tuples with no shared elements: If `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` have no shared elements, the function will return an empty tuple.
- Tuples with duplicate elements: If `test_tup1` or `test_tup2` contains duplicate elements, the function will still correctly identify the shared elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
