Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. It first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(ch)`.
2. Then, it finds the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(ch)`.
3. If the character is not found in the string (i.e., `first_index` or `last_index` is `-1`), or if the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., `first_index == last_index`), it simply returns the original string.
4. Otherwise, it constructs a new string that excludes the first and last occurrences of the character by concatenating three substrings: `s[:first_index]`, `s[first_index + 1:last_index]`, and `s[last_index + 1:]`.

The function handles various edge cases correctly, such as:

* When the character is not found in the string.
* When the character appears only once in the string.
* When the character appears multiple times in the string.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
