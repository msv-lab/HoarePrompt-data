Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `max` function with `sum` as the key to find the list with the highest sum of elements. This approach is correct because it directly addresses the problem description.

Here's why it works for every potential case:

1. **Empty List of Lists**: If the input is an empty list of lists (`[]`), the function will raise a `ValueError` because `max` cannot be applied to an empty sequence. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which does not specify what to do in this case. However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle this edge case explicitly.

2. **List of Lists with Negative Numbers**: The function works correctly even when the lists contain negative numbers, because `sum` correctly handles negative numbers.

3. **List of Lists with Duplicate Maximum Sums**: If there are multiple lists with the same maximum sum, the function will return one of them. The problem description does not specify which one to return in this case, so this behavior is acceptable.

4. **List of Lists with Non-Numeric Elements**: If the lists contain non-numeric elements, the `sum` function will raise a `TypeError`. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which implies that the lists should contain numeric elements.

Overall, the function works as expected for all potential cases, and it correctly handles the edge cases that are not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
