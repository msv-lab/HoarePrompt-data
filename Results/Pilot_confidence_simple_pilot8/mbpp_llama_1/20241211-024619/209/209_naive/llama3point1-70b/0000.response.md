Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to extract the first element of each sublist from a list of sublists. The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this, which is a concise and efficient way to create a new list by iterating over an existing list.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The function takes a list of sublists `sublists` as input.
2. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` iterates over each sublist in the input list.
3. For each sublist, it extracts the first element using `sublist[0]`.
4. The extracted first elements are collected into a new list, which is returned by the function.

The function handles the following cases correctly:

* Empty sublists: If a sublist is empty, attempting to access its first element using `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. However, this is a reasonable behavior, as an empty sublist does not have a first element.
* Sublists with one or more elements: The function correctly extracts the first element of each non-empty sublist.
* List of sublists with varying lengths: The function works correctly regardless of the lengths of the sublists.

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible inputs, including edge cases, it is considered correct.
