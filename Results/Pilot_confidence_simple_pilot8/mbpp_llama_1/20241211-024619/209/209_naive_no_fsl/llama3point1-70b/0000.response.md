Correctness: **False**

The given Python function does not handle the case when the input list is empty or when a sublist is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will not throw an error but will return an empty list, which might be the expected behavior. However, if a sublist is empty, the function will throw an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6]]`, the function will throw an error when it tries to access the first element of the empty sublist.

To fix this, the function could be modified to check if a sublist is empty before trying to access its first element. 

Here is an example of how the function could be modified:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists if sublist]
```
This modified function will return the first element of each non-empty sublist. If the input list is empty, it will return an empty list. If a sublist is empty, it will simply skip that sublist.
