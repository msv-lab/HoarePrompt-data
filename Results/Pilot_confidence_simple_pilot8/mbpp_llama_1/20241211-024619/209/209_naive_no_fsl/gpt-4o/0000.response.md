Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to extract the first element from each sublist within a given list of lists. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and selects the first element (`sublist[0]`) to include in the resulting list.

The function is correct because it handles the task as described in the problem statement for all potential cases. It correctly returns a list containing the first elements of each sublist, regardless of the length of the sublists or the overall list. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios.

The function does not contain any conditional logic or edge case handling that could potentially lead to incorrect results. It simply and consistently extracts the first element from each sublist, making it a straightforward and effective solution to the problem.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`, the function correctly returns `[1, 3, 6]`. Similarly, for the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`, the function returns `[1, 4]`, which matches the expected output.

Since the function behaves as expected for all provided test cases and does not contain any apparent flaws or omissions, it can be concluded that the function is correct.
