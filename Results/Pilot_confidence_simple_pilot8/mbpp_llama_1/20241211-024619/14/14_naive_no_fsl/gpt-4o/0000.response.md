Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It checks if a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. 

Here's why the program works correctly:

1. The function `func_1` initializes an empty set `seen` to store unique elements from the input array.
2. It then iterates through each number `num` in the input array.
3. For each number, it checks if `num` is already present in the `seen` set. If it is, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate element has been found.
4. If `num` is not in the `seen` set, it adds `num` to the set and continues with the next number in the array.
5. If the function iterates through the entire array without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`, indicating that no duplicate elements were found.

The program handles various edge cases, including:

- Empty arrays: The function will return `False` for an empty array, which is correct because an empty array does not contain any duplicate elements.
- Arrays with a single element: The function will return `False` for an array with a single element, which is correct because a single-element array does not contain any duplicate elements.
- Arrays with multiple unique elements: The function will return `False` for arrays with multiple unique elements, which is correct because such arrays do not contain any duplicate elements.
- Arrays with duplicate elements: The function will return `True` for arrays containing duplicate elements, which is correct because such arrays do contain duplicate elements.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and does not contain any logical errors, it is considered correct.
