Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the ticket can be divided into segments with a sum equal to half of the total sum of the ticket. However, the problem description states that the ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums, without specifying that the sum of each segment must be half of the total sum.

For example, consider the ticket "350178" which can be divided into three segments "350", "17", and "8" with equal sums of 8. However, the program would not correctly identify this ticket as lucky because the sum of each segment (8) is not half of the total sum of the ticket.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should check all possible segment sums, not just the sum equal to half of the total sum. 

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to correctly solve the problem:
```python
n = int(input())
ticket = list(map(int, input()))

def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum):
        curr_sum = 0
        segments = 0
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
        if segments >= 2 and curr_sum == 0:
            return True
    return False

if func_1(ticket):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
