Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program is actually calculating the number of divisors of a given number, not the number of different weights of its splits.

For example, when the input is 7, the program outputs 4, which is correct. However, this is just a coincidence. The program is not actually calculating the number of different weights of the splits of 7.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible splits of the given number and then calculate the weight of each split. The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: when the input is 4, the program outputs 3, but the correct output should be 3, because the possible weights of splits of 4 are: 

Weight 1: [4] 
Weight 2: [2, 2] 
Weight 4: [1, 1, 1, 1]

However, the program is counting the divisors of 4, which are 1, 2, and 4, hence the output 3. 

But if we take the input 6, the program outputs 4, but the correct output should be 4, because the possible weights of splits of 6 are: 

Weight 1: [6] 
Weight 2: [3, 3] 
Weight 3: [2, 2, 2] 
Weight 6: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

In this case, the program is correct, but it's just a coincidence. 

So, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. 

Here's a correct Python solution for the problem:

```python
def func_1(n):
    weights = set()
    def generate_splits(n, current_split, last_num):
        if n == 0:
            weights.add(current_split.count(last_num))
        for i in range(min(last_num, n), 0, -1):
            generate_splits(n - i, current_split + [i], i)
    generate_splits(n, [], n)
    return len(weights)

n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```

This solution generates all possible splits of the given number and then calculates the weight of each split. The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. The solution uses a set to store the unique weights of the splits, and finally returns the number of unique weights.
