Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the available number of lemons, apples, and pears, considering the required ratio of 1:2:4. The program then prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which is the sum of the minimum number of lemons, twice the minimum number of lemons (for apples), and four times the minimum number of lemons (for pears).

The program works correctly for all potential cases because it uses the minimum function to find the smallest number of lemons that can be used, which ensures that there are enough apples and pears to meet the required ratio. The program also handles cases where it is not possible to cook the compote (i.e., when there are not enough apples or pears), in which case it will print 0.

For example, if the input is 2, 5, and 7, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons as 1, and prints the total number of fruits as 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Similarly, if the input is 4, 7, and 13, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons as 3, and prints the total number of fruits as 3 + 6 + 12 = 21. If the input is 2, 3, and 2, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons as 0 (because there are not enough pears), and prints 0.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
