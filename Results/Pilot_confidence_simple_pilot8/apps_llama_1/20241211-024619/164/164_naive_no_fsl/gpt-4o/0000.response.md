Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper can jump over obstacles to reach the target insect. The current implementation only checks for a direct path from the grasshopper to the target without considering the possibility of jumping over obstacles.

For example, if the input is:

```
7 2
T..#G..
```

The program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not consider the possibility of the grasshopper jumping over the obstacle to reach the target.

The correct implementation should use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible jumps from the grasshopper's initial position and check if the target insect can be reached.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited.add(G_pos)
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        for jump in [pos - k, pos + k]:
            if 0 <= jump < n and line[jump]!= '#' and jump not in visited:
                queue.append(jump)
                visited.add(jump)
    print('NO')

func()
```
