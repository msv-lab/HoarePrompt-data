Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles. The condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` checks if all the cells in the path from the grasshopper to the insect are empty, but it does not consider the case where the grasshopper jumps over obstacles.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 2
T.#G..
```
In this case, the grasshopper can jump from the cell at index 5 to the cell at index 1, but the program will incorrectly print "NO" because it checks if all the cells in the path are empty.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible jumps from the grasshopper's initial position and check if it can reach the insect's position. 

Here is a correct implementation:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        queue = deque([g])
        visited = set([g])
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if current == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for next in [current + k, current - k]:
                if 0 <= next < n and next not in visited and s[next]!= '#':
                    queue.append(next)
                    visited.add(next)
        print('NO')
```
This program uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible jumps from the grasshopper's initial position and checks if it can reach the insect's position. If it can, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
