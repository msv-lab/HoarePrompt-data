Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it calculates the minimum length of the subsegment to be changed. The program only checks if the target position is in the `position_map` dictionary, which means it only considers the case where the robot can reach the target position by changing the operations from the current position to the target position. However, it does not consider the case where the robot needs to change operations from a previous position to the target position.

A counterexample is when the input is:

```
6
RRRRRR
-2 0
```

The program will return `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to reach the target position. However, the correct answer is `2`, because we can change the first two `R` operations to `L` operations, resulting in the sequence `LLRRRR`, which will move the robot to the target position `(-2, 0)`.

The program does not handle this case correctly because it only checks if the target position is in the `position_map` dictionary, and it does not consider the case where the robot needs to change operations from a previous position to the target position. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program to consider all possible subsegments of the operations sequence and check if changing each subsegment can move the robot to the target position. This can be done by using a sliding window approach or by iterating over all possible subsegments of the operations sequence. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            current_x = 0
            current_y = 0
            for k in range(n):
                if k < i or k > j:
                    if operations[k] == 'U':
                        current_y += 1
                    elif operations[k] == 'D':
                        current_y -= 1
                    elif operations[k] == 'L':
                        current_x -= 1
                    elif operations[k] == 'R':
                        current_x += 1
                else:
                    if k == i:
                        if dx > 0:
                            current_x += 1
                        elif dx < 0:
                            current_x -= 1
                        if dy > 0:
                            current_y += 1
                        elif dy < 0:
                            current_y -= 1
                    else:
                        if current_x < x:
                            current_x += 1
                        elif current_x > x:
                            current_x -= 1
                        if current_y < y:
                            current_y += 1
                        elif current_y > y:
                            current_y -= 1
            if current_x == x and current_y == y:
                min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1
```

This corrected version of the code checks all possible subsegments of the operations sequence and returns the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to move the robot to the target position.
