Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that it only checks for swaps of adjacent trophies and does not consider all possible swaps. 

For example, consider the input "SGGGGSG". The program will not find the optimal swap, which is swapping the first and last 'S', resulting in "GGGGGGS". The program only checks for adjacent swaps, so it will not find this optimal solution.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should check all possible swaps of two trophies, not just adjacent ones. This can be achieved by using nested loops to iterate over all pairs of trophies and checking the beauty of the arrangement after swapping each pair.

Here is a simple example where the program fails:

Input:
```
8
SGGGGSG
```

The program will output `4`, but the correct output is `6`, which can be achieved by swapping the first and last 'S'.
