Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that it only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals is 1, which is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit during each second after switching them on.

A counterexample is the input `2 2 3`. The program will correctly output `YES`, but if we analyze the problem, we can see that the GCD of the time intervals is 1, but the program's logic is correct in this case because it's possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit.

However, the issue arises when we consider the input `2 4 4`. The GCD of the time intervals is 2, so the program will output `NO`. But, if we choose `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 3`, and `x3 = 5`, we can see that at least one garland will be lit during each second after switching them on. This contradicts the program's output.

The correct approach would be to check if there exists a set of starting times for the garlands such that at least one garland is lit during each second after switching them on. This can be done by checking all possible combinations of starting times and verifying if the condition is met.

In conclusion, the program does not correctly solve the problem, and a counterexample can be found to demonstrate its incorrectness.
