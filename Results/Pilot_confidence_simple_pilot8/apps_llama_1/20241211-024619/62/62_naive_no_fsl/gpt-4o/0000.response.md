Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases. It first reads the number of digits and the base for each number, then reads the digits of each number. It uses a helper function `func_1` to convert each number from its respective base to decimal. Finally, it compares the decimal values of the two numbers and prints the result.

The `func_1` function works by iterating over the digits of a number from left to right, multiplying the current decimal value by the base, and adding the current digit. This is a standard algorithm for converting a number from any base to decimal.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Numbers with different bases
* Numbers with different numbers of digits
* Numbers with leading zeroes (although the problem statement guarantees that there will be no leading zeroes)
* Numbers that are equal, less than, or greater than each other

The program also handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For example, in the first sample, the program correctly converts `101111_2` to `47_10` and `47_10` to `47_10`, and prints `=` because the two numbers are equal.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
