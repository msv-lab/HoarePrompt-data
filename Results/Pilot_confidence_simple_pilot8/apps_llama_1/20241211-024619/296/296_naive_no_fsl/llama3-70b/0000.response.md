Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is a prime number greater than 2. For example, if the input is 5, the program will output:

```
YES
2
1 2
1 5
```

However, this output is incorrect because the sum of the fractions 1/2 and 1/5 is not equal to 1 - 1/5. The correct sum should be 4/5, but the program's output does not satisfy this condition.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the fractions. The line `print('1', n // 2)` is incorrect because it does not ensure that the denominator `n // 2` is a divisor of `n` or that the fraction `1/(n // 2)` is part of a sequence that sums to `1 - 1/n`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to find a sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions, which may involve finding the divisors of `n` and constructing a sequence of fractions with those divisors as denominators. The provided program does not perform these steps correctly.
