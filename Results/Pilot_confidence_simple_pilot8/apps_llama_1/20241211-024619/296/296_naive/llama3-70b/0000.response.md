Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 6, the program should output:

YES
2
1 2
1 3

But when the input is 4, the program outputs:

YES
2
1 2
1 4

However, the sum of the fractions 1/2 and 1/4 is 3/4, which is not equal to 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. This seems correct but when the input is 5, the program outputs:

YES
2
1 2
1 5

But the sum of the fractions 1/2 and 1/5 is 7/10, which is not equal to 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. 

This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The program is trying to find a sequence of fractions that sum up to 1 - 1/n, but it does not guarantee that the sum of the fractions will be equal to 1 - 1/n for all inputs. 

The program only works for some specific cases, but it does not work for all cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
