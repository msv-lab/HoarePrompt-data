Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. One potential issue with the program is that it only checks for 2x2 submatrices where all four elements are 1 in matrix A. However, the problem description states that we can choose any submatrix of size 2x2 in matrix B and set all its elements to 1. This means that the program does not consider cases where a 2x2 submatrix in A has only one or two 1s, but can still be set to all 1s in B.

For example, consider the input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
```

The program will not be able to make matrix B equal to matrix A because it only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all four elements being 1. However, we can make B equal to A by choosing the submatrix at position (1,1) and setting all its elements to 1, and then choosing the submatrix at position (2,2) and setting all its elements to 1.

Another issue with the program is that it does not handle cases where a single element in A is 1, but it is not part of a 2x2 submatrix with all four elements being 1. In such cases, the program will not be able to make B equal to A.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible 2x2 submatrices in B and set their elements to 1 if necessary. The program also needs to handle cases where a single element in A is 1, but it is not part of a 2x2 submatrix with all four elements being 1. 

The correct approach would be to iterate over all elements in A, and for each element, check if it is 1. If it is, check if it can be set to 1 in B by choosing a 2x2 submatrix that includes the element. If it can, add the corresponding operation to the list of operations. If it cannot, return -1 to indicate that it is not possible to make B equal to A.
