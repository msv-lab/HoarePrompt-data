Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue with the program is that it only checks if at least one of the four elements in a 2x2 submatrix is 1, and if so, it sets all four elements to 1. However, this approach can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The program will output:
```
4
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
However, this sequence of operations will not make matrix B equal to matrix A, because the operations will set the middle elements of the matrix to 1, which is not what we want.

A correct approach would be to iterate over the matrix from bottom to top and from right to left, and for each 2x2 submatrix, check if all four elements are 1. If they are, we can skip this submatrix. If not, we need to set all four elements to 1.

Here's a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 0 and A[i + 1][j] == 0 and A[i][j + 1] == 0 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 0:
                continue
            ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
```
This implementation correctly checks each 2x2 submatrix and sets all four elements to 1 if any of them are 1. However, it still has the issue of not checking if the resulting matrix B is equal to matrix A.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to keep track of the resulting matrix B and check if it is equal to matrix A after each operation. If it is not, we need to backtrack and try a different sequence of operations. This can be done using a backtracking algorithm.

Here's a possible correct implementation using backtracking:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    def backtrack(i, j):
        if i == n:
            if B == A:
                return True
            return False
        if j == m:
            return backtrack(i + 1, 0)
        if A[i][j] == 0:
            return backtrack(i, j + 1)
        if i < n - 1 and j < m - 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
            ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
            B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
            if backtrack(i, j + 1):
                return True
            ops.pop()
            B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 0
        return backtrack(i, j + 1)
    if backtrack(0, 0):
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
    else:
        print(-1)
```
This implementation correctly uses backtracking to find a sequence of operations that makes matrix B equal to matrix A. If no such sequence exists, it prints -1.
