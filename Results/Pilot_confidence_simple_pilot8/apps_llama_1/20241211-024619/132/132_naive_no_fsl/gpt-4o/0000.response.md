Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it checks if the total number of stones in the second visit (`total_y`) is greater than the total number of stones in the first visit (`total_x`). If `total_y` is greater, it means that the jury members must have added stones to the piles, which is not allowed according to the problem description. In this case, the program correctly outputs "No".

On the other hand, if `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, it means that the jury members can achieve the second configuration by either taking stones from the piles or moving stones from one pile to another. In this case, the program correctly outputs "Yes".

The program does not need to check the individual piles or the specific movements of the jury members, as the total number of stones is the only constraint that matters. The problem description does not require the program to find the actual sequence of movements, but only to determine if the second configuration is possible.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
