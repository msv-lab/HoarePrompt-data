Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready.

In the `func_1` function, it checks all pairs of meat pieces and calculates the midpoint and the distance from the midpoint to the line segment connecting the two pieces. However, this approach is not sufficient to find the optimal position of the heat source.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Suppose we have three pieces of meat with coordinates (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0.5, 1) and hardness values 1, 1, and 2, respectively. If we want to cook at least two pieces of meat, the optimal position of the heat source would be (0.5, 0.5), which is not a midpoint of any line segment connecting two pieces of meat.

In this case, the program would not be able to find the optimal position of the heat source, and therefore, it would not produce the correct result.

To fix this issue, a more sophisticated approach would be needed, such as using a geometric algorithm to find the smallest circle that covers at least K pieces of meat. This would require a more complex implementation, but it would ensure that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
