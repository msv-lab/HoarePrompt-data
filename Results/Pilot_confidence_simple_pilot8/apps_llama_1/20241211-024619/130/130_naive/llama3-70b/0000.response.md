Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins that each friend can gift to Ivan, satisfying all the given conditions. 

Here's a breakdown of the conditions and how the program handles them:

1. Everyone must gift as many coins as others: The program assumes that each friend will gift the same number of coins, which is the minimum required to satisfy the other conditions.

2. All coins given to Ivan must be different: The program ensures this by checking if the number of friends (M) is greater than or equal to the number of new coins that Ivan needs to receive (N - K + 1) and the minimum number of new coins required (L). If M is sufficient, then each friend can gift 1 coin, and since M >= N - K + 1, it is guaranteed that Ivan will receive at least N - K + 1 new coins, which is the maximum number of new coins he can receive.

3. Not less than L coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection: The program checks if M is greater than or equal to L, ensuring that the total number of new coins gifted to Ivan is at least L.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where M is less than N - K + 1 or L, in which case it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly outputs 1, as each friend can gift 1 coin, and Ivan will receive at least 13 new coins (15 - 2). In the second example, the program correctly outputs -1, as it is impossible for all 11 friends to gift different coins when there are only 10 different coins available. 

Overall, the program is correct and handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
