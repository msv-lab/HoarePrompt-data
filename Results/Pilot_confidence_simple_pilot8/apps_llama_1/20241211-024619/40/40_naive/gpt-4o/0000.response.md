Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider the input string "abba". The longest non-palindrome substring of this string is "abb" or "bba" with a length of 3. However, the program will return 0 because it checks if the entire string is a palindrome, then if the string without the first character is a palindrome, and finally if the string without the last character is a palindrome. Since the string "abba" is a palindrome and the strings "bba" and "abb" are also palindromes, the program will return 0.

The program should check all substrings of the input string, not just the entire string and the string without the first or last character. This is why the program is incorrect. 

The correct approach would be to check all substrings of the input string and keep track of the longest one that is not a palindrome. If no such substring is found, the program should return 0. 

Here is a simple example of how this could be done:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def longest_non_palindrome(s):
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substring = s[i:j]
            if not func_1(substring):
                max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))
    return max_length

s = input().strip()
print(longest_non_palindrome(s))
```
