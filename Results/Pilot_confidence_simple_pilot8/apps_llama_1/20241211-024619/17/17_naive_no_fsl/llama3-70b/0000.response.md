Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, but it does not consider the relationship between `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` that is required to form a regular bracket sequence.

A counterexample to the program is when `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 1`. In this case, the program will print `1`, indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence. However, the only possible string that can be formed is `)()`, which is not a regular bracket sequence.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets, and if the number of closing brackets at any point in the sequence does not exceed the number of opening brackets. 

Here's a correct Python program for the problem:
```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3 == cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt1 + cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```
This program checks if the total number of opening brackets (`cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt3`) is equal to the total number of closing brackets (`cnt2 + cnt3 + cnt4`), and if the number of opening brackets that can be used to balance the closing brackets in `cnt3` is sufficient (`cnt1 + cnt2 >= cnt3`). If both conditions are met, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`.
