Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as per the problem description. 

Here's an explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The input angle `x` is first reduced to its equivalent angle within the range of 0 to 359 degrees using the modulo operator (`x = x % 360`).

2. If the reduced angle `x` is 0, it means the camera is not rotated, so the program prints 0, which is the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required.

3. For non-zero angles, the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical using the formula `print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)`.

   - The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90` calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to rotate the image to an angle that is at least 90 degrees more than the current angle `x`. The `- 1` is used to perform ceiling division (i.e., round up to the nearest integer).
   
   - The `% 4` operation ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to 3, which corresponds to the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to achieve the desired rotation.

The provided code seems to handle all possible input cases correctly, including positive and negative angles, and it produces the expected output for the given examples. Without a specific counterexample, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
