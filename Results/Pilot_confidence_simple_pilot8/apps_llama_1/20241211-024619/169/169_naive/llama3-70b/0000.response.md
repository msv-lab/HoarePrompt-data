Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func()` appears to correctly calculate the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the given operations. 

Here's why:

- The function first counts the number of '-' (minus) and '+' (plus) operations in the string `s`.
- If the number of minus operations is greater than the number of plus operations, it means that Vasya had to start with at least as many stones as the number of minus operations. In this case, the minimum number of stones left in the pile would be 0, which is correctly printed by the function.
- If the number of minus operations is not greater than the number of plus operations, it means that Vasya could have started with 0 stones and still performed all the operations. In this case, the minimum number of stones left in the pile would be the difference between the number of plus operations and the number of minus operations, which is also correctly calculated and printed by the function.

The function handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of minus operations is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of plus operations. 

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the given examples, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
