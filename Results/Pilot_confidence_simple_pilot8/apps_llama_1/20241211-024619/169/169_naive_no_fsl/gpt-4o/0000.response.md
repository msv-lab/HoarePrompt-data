Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program starts with 0 stones in the pile, but the problem description states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations, considering that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. 

The program does not consider the minimum number of stones required to perform the operations without the pile being empty. For example, if the input is "3" and the operations are "---", the program will output 0, but it does not consider that the pile must have had at least 3 stones initially to perform the operations.

Here is a correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = 0
    stones = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones -= 1
            min_stones = max(min_stones, -stones)
    print(max(0, min_stones) + stones)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations, considering that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.
