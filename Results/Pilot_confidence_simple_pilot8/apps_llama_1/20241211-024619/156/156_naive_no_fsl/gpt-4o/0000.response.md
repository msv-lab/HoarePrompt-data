Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It accurately calculates Lara's current position after she moves k times in the dungeon.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The initial movement from cell (1,1) to cell (n,1) is handled correctly by checking if k is less than n-1. If so, it simply prints the current row (k+1) and column (1).

2. For k greater than or equal to n-1, it calculates the number of full rows Lara has traversed (full_rows) and the remaining steps (remaining_steps) after subtracting the initial movement.

3. The program then determines the current row and column based on whether the number of full rows is even or odd. If it's even, Lara is moving to the right; if it's odd, she's moving to the left.

The program handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as k being 0 (the starting position) or k being equal to n*m - 1 (the final position). It also correctly handles cases where Lara is moving up or down.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided examples in the problem description also match the output of the program, further confirming its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
