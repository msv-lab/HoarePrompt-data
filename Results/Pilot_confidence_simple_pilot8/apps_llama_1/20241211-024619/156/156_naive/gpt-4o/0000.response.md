Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It accurately simulates Lara's movement through the dungeon and calculates her current position after k steps.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If k is less than n - 1, it means Lara is still moving down the first column. In this case, the program prints the current row as k + 1 and the column as 1.

2. If k is greater than or equal to n - 1, it means Lara has finished moving down the first column and has started moving in a snake-like pattern. The program calculates the number of full rows Lara has traversed (full_rows) and the remaining steps (remaining_steps) after subtracting the steps taken to traverse the full rows.

3. Depending on whether the number of full rows is even or odd, the program calculates the current row and column. If the number of full rows is even, Lara is moving to the right, and if it's odd, she's moving to the left.

The program handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where k is 0 (Lara is at the starting position) or k is equal to n * m - 1 (Lara is at the final position).

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
