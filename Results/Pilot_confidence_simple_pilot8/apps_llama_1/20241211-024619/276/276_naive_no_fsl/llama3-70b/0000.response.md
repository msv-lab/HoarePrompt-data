Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the formula for converting a number from the golden system to decimal, as described in the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`.

The main part of the program reads two golden system numbers as input, converts them to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values to determine which number is larger.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Numbers of different lengths
* Numbers with leading zeros
* Numbers with all zeros or all ones
* Numbers that are equal in decimal value

The use of the `enumerate` function to iterate over the reversed string ensures that the digits are processed in the correct order, from least significant to most significant.

The program also correctly handles the calculation of the decimal value using the formula `decimal += int(c) * q ** i`, where `q` is the golden ratio and `i` is the position of the digit.

Overall, the program is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
