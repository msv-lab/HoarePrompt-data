Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 4 3 6, the program will output "YES" and print the points (0, 0), (2, 1), and (0, 1). However, the area of the triangle formed by these points is 1, not 2, which is the expected area (4 * 3 / 6 = 2).

Another issue with the program is that it only checks if the area is an integer, but it does not guarantee that the points it prints will actually form a triangle with the correct area. The program's logic for printing the points is also flawed, as it does not take into account the actual values of n and m.

To fix this program, we would need to implement a more robust algorithm that can correctly calculate the points for any given input. This could involve using more advanced geometric calculations or implementing a brute-force search to find the correct points. 

Here's an example of how the correct code could look like:
```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area!= int(area) or area == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if 2 * area <= n and 1 <= m:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            print(f'{2 * area} 0')
            print(f'{2 * area} 1')
        elif 2 * area <= m and 1 <= n:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            print(f'0 {2 * area}')
            print(f'1 {2 * area}')
        else:
            print('NO')
```
