Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One case where the program fails is when `n` and `m` are both even and `k` is 2. In this case, the area of the triangle should be `n * m / 2`, which is an integer. However, the program will print 'NO' because it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`, which may not be true.

For example, if the input is `4 4 2`, the program will print 'NO', but it should print 'YES' with the points `(0, 0)`, `(4, 0)`, and `(0, 4)`.

Another case where the program fails is when `n` is odd and `m` is even, and `k` is 2. In this case, the area of the triangle should be `n * m / 2`, which is an integer. However, the program will print 'NO' because it checks if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`, which may not be true.

For example, if the input is `3 4 2`, the program will print 'NO', but it should print 'YES' with the points `(0, 0)`, `(3, 0)`, and `(0, 4)`.

The program needs to be modified to handle these cases correctly. It should check if the area of the triangle is an integer, and if so, it should try to find three points that satisfy the conditions. If it cannot find such points, it should print 'NO'. 

The program should also consider the cases where `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, and `k` is an odd number. In these cases, the area of the triangle may not be an integer, and the program should print 'NO'.

In general, the program should be modified to handle all possible cases, including the cases where `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, and `k` is an odd or even number. It should also consider the cases where `n` is odd and `m` is even, or vice versa, and `k` is an odd or even number. 

The program should be able to handle all these cases correctly and print the correct output for each case. 

Here is a possible modification of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area!= int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if area * 2 <= n:
                print(f'{area * 2} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif area * 2 <= m:
                print(f'1 {area * 2}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                # try to find other points
                for x in range(1, n + 1):
                    for y in range(1, m + 1):
                        # calculate the area of the triangle
                        triangle_area = abs((x * (m - y) + y * (n - x)) / 2)
                        if triangle_area == area:
                            print(f'{x} {y}')
                            print(f'{n} {m}')
                            return
                print('NO')

func()
```

This modified program will try to find three points that satisfy the conditions for all possible cases. If it cannot find such points, it will print 'NO'. 

However, this program may not be efficient for large inputs, because it uses a brute force approach to find the points. A more efficient program would use a more clever approach to find the points, such as using the properties of triangles and the formula for the area of a triangle. 

In conclusion, the original program is incorrect, and a modified program is needed to handle all possible cases correctly. The modified program should be able to find three points that satisfy the conditions for all possible cases, or print 'NO' if no such points exist.
