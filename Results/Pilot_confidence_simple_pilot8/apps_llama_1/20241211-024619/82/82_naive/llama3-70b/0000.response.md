Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for values of `k` until it finds a value where the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` is not less than the previous value. However, this does not guarantee that the program has found the smallest `k` that results in the smallest possible least common multiple.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows: suppose `a = 10` and `b = 15`. The program will start checking values of `k` from 0 and will find that `k = 0` results in a least common multiple of 30, `k = 1` results in a least common multiple of 33, and `k = 2` results in a least common multiple of 36. At this point, the program will stop checking because the least common multiple is not decreasing. However, if we continue checking, we will find that `k = 5` results in a least common multiple of 30, which is the same as the least common multiple for `k = 0`. Therefore, the program should return `k = 0`, but it will return `k = 0` as well because it stops checking as soon as it finds a value of `k` where the least common multiple is not decreasing.

However, a more significant issue is that the program does not handle the case where the least common multiple is the same for multiple values of `k`. In such cases, the program should return the smallest `k`, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

To fix these issues, the program should continue checking values of `k` until it finds a value where the least common multiple is greater than the minimum least common multiple found so far, and it should keep track of the smallest `k` that results in the minimum least common multiple. 

Here is a revised version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
import math

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
min_lcm = float('inf')
min_k = 0
k = 0
while k < a + b:
    lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    if lcm < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = lcm
        min_k = k
    k += 1
print(min_k)
```

This revised version of the code continues checking values of `k` until it has checked all possible values, and it keeps track of the smallest `k` that results in the minimum least common multiple.
