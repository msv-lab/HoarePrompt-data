Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `can_distribute` function. This function checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces of cake is greater than or equal to the total number of plates `n`. However, this function does not take into account the condition that each plate can only contain pieces of one type of cake.

A counterexample is when `n = 3`, `a = 4`, and `b = 4`. The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `1`. This is because the only way to distribute the cakes is to put `1` piece of cake on each of two plates and `2` pieces of cake on the remaining plate, or `4` pieces of one cake on one plate and `1` piece of the other cake on the other two plates. In both cases, the minimum number of pieces on a plate is `1`.

The program does not correctly handle this case because it only checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces of cake is greater than or equal to `n`, without considering the constraint that each plate can only contain pieces of one type of cake.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the condition that each plate can only contain pieces of one type of cake. This can be done by checking all possible combinations of distributing the cakes to the plates, and finding the maximum minimum number of pieces on a plate that satisfies the conditions. 

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    max_x = 0
    for x in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if a // x + (n - i) <= n and b // x + i <= n and a // x + (n - i) >= 0 and b // x + i >= 0 and a // x + b // x >= n:
                max_x = max(max_x, x)
    return max_x
```
This code checks all possible combinations of distributing the cakes to the plates, and finds the maximum minimum number of pieces on a plate that satisfies the conditions. However, this code may not be efficient for large inputs due to its brute-force nature. A more efficient solution would be to use a binary search approach, similar to the original code, but with a corrected `can_distribute` function that takes into account the condition that each plate can only contain pieces of one type of cake. 

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid, n, a, b):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(x, n, a, b):
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if a >= x * i and b >= x * (n - i):
            return True
    return False
```
This code uses a binary search approach to find the maximum minimum number of pieces on a plate that satisfies the conditions, and it correctly handles the condition that each plate can only contain pieces of one type of cake.
