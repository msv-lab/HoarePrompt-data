Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, but it does not consider the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the positions of the lowercase letters in the pretty set.

For example, if the input string is "aAa", the program will print 3, but the correct answer is 1, because there is an uppercase letter 'A' between the first and second 'a's, so they cannot be in the same pretty set.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a more complex algorithm that takes into account the positions of the uppercase letters and the distinctness of the lowercase letters. 

Here is an example of a correct Python solution:
```python
def max_pretty_set(n, s):
    max_len = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        pos = [i for i in range(n) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        if not pos:
            continue
        if not all(s[i].islower() for i in pos):
            continue
        if len(pos)!= len(set(s[i] for i in pos)):
            continue
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(pos) - 1):
            for j in range(pos[i] + 1, pos[i + 1]):
                if s[j].isupper():
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            max_len = max(max_len, len(pos))
    return max_len

n = int(input())
s = input()
print(max_pretty_set(n, s))
```
