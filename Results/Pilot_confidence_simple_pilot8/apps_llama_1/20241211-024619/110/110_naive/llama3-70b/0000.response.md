Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. The problem requires distributing k fishes in the pond to maximize the expected number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed randomly. However, the program simply calculates the minimum between k and the number of possible positions of the scoop-net, and then divides it by the number of possible positions.

This approach does not consider the optimal placement of fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. The correct approach would involve distributing the fishes in a way that maximizes the overlap between the fishes and the scoop-net, regardless of its position.

For example, if we have a 3x3 pond, a 2x2 scoop-net, and 3 fishes, the program would output 1.0, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 2.0, which can be achieved by placing the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3), as shown in the problem description.

In general, the program does not correctly solve the problem and does not consider all possible cases, so its correctness is **False**.
