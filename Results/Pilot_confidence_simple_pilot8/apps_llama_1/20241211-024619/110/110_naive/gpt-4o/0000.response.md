Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a solution to the problem of maximizing the expected number of caught fishes in a rectangular pond by placing k fishes in distinct cells. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. It uses a heap to store the coverage of each cell in the pond, where coverage is defined as the number of possible positions of the scoop-net that can catch a fish in that cell.

2. The `coverage` function calculates the coverage of a cell at position (x, y). This is done by finding the number of possible positions of the scoop-net that can catch a fish in that cell, which is the product of the number of possible x-positions and y-positions.

3. The program then pops the k cells with the highest coverage from the heap, adds up their coverage, and divides by the total number of possible positions of the scoop-net to get the expected number of caught fishes.

The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. It uses a greedy approach to place the k fishes in the cells with the highest coverage, which maximizes the expected number of caught fishes. 

The time complexity of the code is O(n*m*log(n*m)), which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem. The space complexity is O(n*m), which is also acceptable.

The code also handles edge cases correctly, such as when k is 0 or when the pond is too small to fit the scoop-net.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs. 

However, without a formal proof of correctness, it's impossible to be 100% certain that the code works correctly for all possible inputs. But based on the provided code and problem description, it seems that the code is correct. 

One potential issue with the code is that it uses floating-point arithmetic, which can sometimes lead to precision issues. However, the problem statement allows for a relative error of up to 10^-9, which should be sufficient to handle any precision issues that may arise. 

In conclusion, based on the provided code and problem description, it appears that the code is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
