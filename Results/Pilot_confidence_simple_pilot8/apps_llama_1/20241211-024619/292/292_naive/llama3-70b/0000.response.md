Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of full years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger (heavier) than Bob. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program starts by reading the initial weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`) from the input.
2. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
3. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`) to simulate the weight changes after each year.
4. The `years` variable is incremented by 1 after each iteration to keep track of the number of years that have passed.
5. Once Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, the loop exits, and the program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become larger than Bob.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. For instance, when the input is `4 7`, the program correctly outputs `2`, which is the number of years it takes for Limak to become larger than Bob. Similarly, when the input is `4 9`, the program correctly outputs `3`, and when the input is `1 1`, the program correctly outputs `1`.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
