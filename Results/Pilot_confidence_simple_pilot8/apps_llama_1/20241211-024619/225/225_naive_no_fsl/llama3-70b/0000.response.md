Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "BCD", the program will output 0, but the correct output should be the length of the string plus 1, because the grasshopper cannot reach the end of the string by jumping only on vowels. 

In this case, the program does not handle the situation when there are no vowels in the string. The program should return the length of the string plus 1 in this case, because the grasshopper cannot reach the end of the string by jumping only on vowels.

Here is the correct code:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i - last_vowel)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel == -1:
        max_jump = n
    else:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, n - last_vowel)
    print(max_jump)
```

This corrected code will return the correct minimum jump ability for the grasshopper to reach the end of the string by jumping only on vowels.
