Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. 

One issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the count of factors of 5 in the factorial of n. The line `if n // 5 ** count >= m:` is not accurate because it does not take into account the powers of 5 that are greater than count.

Another issue is that the program does not correctly generate the list of integers n that have exactly m trailing zeroes in their factorial. The condition `if n // 5 ** count < m:` is not sufficient to determine if the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeroes.

For example, if the input is 3, the program will not correctly output the integers n that have exactly 3 trailing zeroes in their factorial. The correct output should be the integers n such that the number of factors of 5 in n! is equal to 3, which is not what the program calculates.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of each integer n, and then check if this number is equal to m. We can use the formula for the number of factors of a prime p in n!, which is given by the sum of the quotients of n divided by powers of p. 

Here is an example of a correct Python program for this problem:

```python
def find_trailing_zeroes(m):
    def count_factors_of_5(n):
        count = 0
        i = 5
        while n // i >= 1:
            count += n // i
            i *= 5
        return count

    ans = []
    n = 1
    while True:
        if count_factors_of_5(n) > m:
            break
        if count_factors_of_5(n) == m:
            ans.append(n)
        n += 1

    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

m = int(input())
find_trailing_zeroes(m)
```

This program correctly calculates the number of factors of 5 in the factorial of each integer n, and then checks if this number is equal to m. It generates the list of integers n that have exactly m trailing zeroes in their factorial, and prints the length of this list and the list itself.
