Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of decoding the genome by replacing unrecognized nucleotides with one of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') so that the number of nucleotides of each type becomes equal.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. It first checks if the length of the genome is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' as it's impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide type.
2. It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type in the genome.
3. If any nucleotide type already exceeds the target count (which is the length of the genome divided by 4), it prints '===' as it's impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide type.
4. It then iterates through the genome, replacing each unrecognized nucleotide ('?') with a nucleotide type that has a count less than the target count.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Genomes with no unrecognized nucleotides.
* Genomes with unrecognized nucleotides that can be replaced to achieve an equal number of each nucleotide type.
* Genomes with unrecognized nucleotides that cannot be replaced to achieve an equal number of each nucleotide type (in which case it prints '===').

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
