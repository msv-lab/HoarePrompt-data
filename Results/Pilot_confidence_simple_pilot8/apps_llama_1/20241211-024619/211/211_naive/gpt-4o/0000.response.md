Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

```
4
-1 1 -2 2
```

The program will print 'NO' because the total sum of the array is 0, but it does not try to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. In this case, the array can be split into two subarrays: [-1, 1] and [-2, 2], both with sums of 0, but the program does not handle this case. However, the task is to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums, and this example does not provide a valid split.

A correct counterexample is:

```
5
1 -1 1 -1 1
```

The program will print 'YES' and then '1' and '1 5', but this is not a valid solution because the sum of the entire array is 1, and the task requires splitting the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. A correct solution would be to split the array into subarrays [1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1], and [1], but the program does not handle this case.

The program only checks if the total sum of the array is non-zero, and if so, it prints the entire array as a single subarray. However, it does not try to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums when the total sum is zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
