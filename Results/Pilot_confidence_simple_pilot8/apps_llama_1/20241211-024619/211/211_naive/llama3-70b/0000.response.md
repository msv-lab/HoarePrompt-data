Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:
```
4
1 2 3 -6
```
The program will print:
```
YES
1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4
```
However, this output is incorrect because the sum of elements in the subarray `1 1` is `1`, which is not zero, but the sum of elements in the subarray `2 2` is `2`, which is also not zero, and the sum of elements in the subarray `3 3` is `3`, which is also not zero. The correct output should be:
```
YES
1
1 4
```
This is because the sum of elements in the subarray `1 4` is `1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = 0`, which is not zero.

Another issue with the program is that it prints the number of subarrays and the subarray indices in the same line, which is not according to the problem description. The problem description requires the number of subarrays to be printed in a separate line, followed by the subarray indices.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
