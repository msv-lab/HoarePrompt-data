Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The program first reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a` from the input.
2. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
3. It initializes the variable `mex` to 1, which represents the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.
4. It then iterates through the sorted array `a`. For each number `num` in the array, it checks if `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. If it is, it increments `mex` by 1.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`, which represents the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations.

The program works correctly because it takes into account the fact that Alyona can decrease any element in the array to a smaller positive integer. By sorting the array and iterating through it, the program effectively finds the maximum possible value of mex by considering all possible decreases of the elements.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When the array contains duplicate elements, the program correctly ignores them and only considers the smallest possible value for each element.
* When the array contains elements that are already in their smallest possible form (i.e., 1), the program correctly increments `mex` accordingly.
* When the array is empty or contains only one element, the program correctly handles these edge cases.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
