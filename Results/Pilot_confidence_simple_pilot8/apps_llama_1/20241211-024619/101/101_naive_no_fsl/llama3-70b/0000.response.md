Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It correctly identifies the minimum size of the square frame that can be drawn on the monitor to cover all the white pixels. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the input and stores the state of the monitor pixels in a 2D list.
2. It identifies the positions of all the white pixels and finds the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of these pixels.
3. It calculates the size of the square frame that can be drawn to cover all the white pixels.
4. If the size of the frame is larger than the size of the monitor, it prints -1, indicating that it's not possible to draw a frame that covers all the white pixels without going beyond the borders of the monitor.
5. Otherwise, it draws the frame on the monitor by replacing the black pixels on the border of the frame with '+' characters.

The program seems to handle all the edge cases correctly, including cases where the white pixels are not contiguous, cases where the frame size is 1, and cases where the frame doesn't exist.

The program also correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description, producing the expected output for each example.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
