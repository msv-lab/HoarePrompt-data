Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. The algorithm states that Amr follows an infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." and executes the characters of the string using specific rules. However, the program simply calculates the path to the exit node using binary representation and does not take into account the rules of the algorithm.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is 2 3. The program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 5. This is because the algorithm would execute the commands as follows:

1. Start at the root node.
2. Execute the command "L" and move to the left child.
3. Execute the command "R" and move to the right child of the left child.
4. Since the destination node is a leaf node and not the exit, return to the parent node.
5. Execute the command "L" and move to the left child of the root node.
6. Since the destination node is already visited, skip the command "R".
7. Execute the command "L" and move to the left child of the left child of the root node.
8. Since the destination node is the exit, the game is finished.

The program does not correctly implement this algorithm and therefore does not produce the correct output for all cases.
