Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It only defines two variables `a` and `b` in terms of `x`, but it does not use the given sum `s` or generate all possible pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions.

A correct solution would involve using the fact that `a + b = s` and `a ^ b = x`. We can use these equations to find the possible values of `a` and `b`. 

For example, we can use the fact that `a + b = s` and `a ^ b = x` to get `a = (s + x) / 2` and `b = (s - x) / 2` when `s` and `x` have the same parity. However, the provided program does not implement this logic.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is `9 5`. The program does not output `4`, which is the correct number of solutions for this input. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible cases and generate all possible pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions. The provided program does not do this, so it is incorrect. 

Here is a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count
```
