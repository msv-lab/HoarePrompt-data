Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks pairs of integers (a, b) where a <= b, due to the line `for b in range(a, r + 1):`. However, the problem statement explicitly mentions that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a!= b. 

To fix this, the program should check all pairs of integers (a, b) in the range [l, r], not just those where a <= b. This can be achieved by changing the line `for b in range(a, r + 1):` to `for b in range(l, r + 1):`. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input values l, r, x, and y are not within the specified ranges. It assumes that the inputs will always be valid, which may not be the case. 

A correct implementation would need to include input validation and handle all possible pairs of integers (a, b) in the range [l, r]. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)

(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)
```
