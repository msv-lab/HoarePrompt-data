Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue with the program is that it only checks if the graph has a cycle or not, but it does not check if removing at most one edge can make the graph acyclic.

The program only prints "YES" if the graph is already acyclic and prints "NO" if the graph has a cycle. However, it does not consider the case where removing one edge can make the graph acyclic.

For example, consider the graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1). The program will print "NO" because the graph has a cycle. However, removing the edge (3, 1) will make the graph acyclic, so the correct output should be "YES".

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check all possible edges and see if removing any one of them can make the graph acyclic. 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
Output:
NO
Expected Output:
YES 

This is because removing the edge (3, 1) will make the graph acyclic. The program should print "YES" for this input, but it prints "NO" instead.
