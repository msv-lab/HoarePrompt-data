Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and follows the problem description. It checks all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It initializes a `position` variable to 0, which represents the current position of Limak on the globe, with 0 being the North Pole and 20000 being the South Pole.

2. It then iterates over each instruction in the journey. For each instruction, it checks the direction and updates the `position` accordingly.

3. If the direction is 'North', it subtracts the distance from the current position. If the direction is 'South', it adds the distance to the current position.

4. If the direction is 'West' or 'East', it checks if Limak is currently at the North Pole or the South Pole. If he is, it sets `valid` to False, because Limak can only move 'West' or 'East' if he is not at the poles.

5. After updating the position, it checks if the position is within the valid range (0 to 20000). If it's not, it sets `valid` to False.

6. Finally, after all instructions have been processed, it checks if the final position is 0 (i.e., the North Pole). If it's not, it sets `valid` to False.

7. If `valid` is still True after all checks, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, including the conditions that Limak can only move 'South' from the North Pole, only move 'North' from the South Pole, and must end at the North Pole. 

The code seems to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs. It checks all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and handles edge cases correctly. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
