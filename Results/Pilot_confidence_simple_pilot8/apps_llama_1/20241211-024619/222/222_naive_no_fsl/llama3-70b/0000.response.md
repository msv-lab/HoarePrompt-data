Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers by dividing the total number of skewers `n` by the number of skewers that can be turned in one step (`k * 2 + 1`). The result is rounded up to the nearest integer using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.

The program then generates the sequence of skewers to be turned over by starting from the first skewer and incrementing by `k * 2 + 1` each time. This ensures that each skewer is turned over exactly once, and the minimum number of actions is achieved.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is less than or equal to `k * 2 + 1`, in which case only one action is needed. It also handles cases where `k` is 0, in which case each skewer must be turned over individually.

The provided examples in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program. For instance, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `2` and `1 6`, which is a correct solution. Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program outputs `2` and `1 4`, which is also a correct solution.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and handles all possible cases according to the problem description.
