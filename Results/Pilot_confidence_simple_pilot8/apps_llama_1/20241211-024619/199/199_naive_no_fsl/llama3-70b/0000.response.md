Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to count the number of ways to split a stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The program uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs of lengths `(a, b)` that can be used to form a rectangle. The condition `2 * (a + b) == n` ensures that the sum of the lengths of the four parts is equal to the length of the stick `n`. The condition `a!= b` ensures that the rectangle is not a square.

The program correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick by incrementing the `ways` variable whenever it finds a valid pair of lengths `(a, b)`.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For example, when `n = 6`, the program correctly outputs `1` because there is only one way to divide the stick into four parts of positive integer length that can form a rectangle but not a square, which is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.

Similarly, when `n = 20`, the program correctly outputs `4` because there are four ways to divide the stick into four parts of positive integer length that can form a rectangle but not a square, which are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic to solve the problem.
