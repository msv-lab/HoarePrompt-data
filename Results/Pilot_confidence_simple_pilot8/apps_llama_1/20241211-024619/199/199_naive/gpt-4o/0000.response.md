Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to correctly count the number of ways to split a stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- It iterates over all possible values for `a`, which represents the length of two of the stick's parts.
- For each `a`, it calculates the remaining length `rem` after subtracting `2 * a` and `2 * b` (where `b = a`) from the total length `n`.
- If `rem` is positive and even, it means that the remaining two parts can have the same length (`rem // 2`).
- The program then checks if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, which ensures that it's impossible to form a square using these parts.
- If all conditions are met, it increments the count.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` is less than 6 (in which case it returns 0). It also correctly identifies the cases where it's possible to form a rectangle but not a square.

For example, when `n = 6`, the program correctly returns 1, which corresponds to the case where the stick is split into parts of lengths 1, 1, 2, and 2.

Similarly, when `n = 20`, the program correctly returns 4, which corresponds to the cases where the stick is split into parts of lengths 1, 1, 9, 9; 2, 2, 8, 8; 3, 3, 7, 7; and 4, 4, 6, 6.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
