Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks all possible combinations of buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars within the given budget `n`. It iterates over the possible number of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`) and calculates the corresponding number of Bars bars (`y`) that can be bought with the remaining budget. If it finds a combination where the total cost equals `n`, it prints 'YES' along with the combination and exits. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the cases where `x` or `y` can be 0, as well as the cases where the total cost is exactly equal to `n`. The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the program only considers whole numbers of bottles and bars, as required by the problem statement.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, and it is unlikely that there are any edge cases that the program does not handle correctly.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, it appears that the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
