Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn in M minutes. The issue lies in the way it calculates the number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time. The program currently calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved for each subtask type, but it does not consider the optimal way to distribute the remaining time among the subtasks.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3 10
1 3 6
```
In this case, the program will first try to complete as many tasks as possible. It can complete 1 task in 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 minutes, earning 4 points. Then, it will try to solve subtasks with the remaining time, but since there is no remaining time, it will not earn any additional points.

However, a more optimal solution would be to complete 2 tasks partially. Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all 3 tasks in 1 * 3 = 3 minutes, earning 3 points. Then, he can solve the second subtask of 2 tasks in 3 * 2 = 6 minutes, earning 2 additional points. Finally, he can solve the third subtask of 1 task in 6 minutes, but he does not have enough time for this. So, the total points earned would be 3 + 2 = 5 points.

The program does not consider this optimal solution and therefore does not produce the correct result. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible ways to distribute the remaining time among the subtasks and choose the one that earns the maximum points. This can be achieved by using a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm with a more sophisticated strategy for choosing the subtasks to solve.
