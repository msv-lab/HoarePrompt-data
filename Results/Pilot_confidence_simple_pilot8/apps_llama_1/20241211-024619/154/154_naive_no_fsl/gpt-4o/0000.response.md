Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. 

The issue with the program lies in the way it calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved with the remaining time. The program currently calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved by dividing the remaining time by the time required for each subtask, which is incorrect. 

This is because the program does not consider the fact that the subtasks can be solved in any order, and it does not try to solve the subtasks that require the least amount of time first.

For example, consider the input:

```
2 3 10
5 3 2
```

In this case, the program will first try to complete as many tasks as possible, which is 1 task in this case (5 + 3 + 2 = 10 minutes). However, it will not consider the possibility of solving the subtasks that require the least amount of time first, which would be solving the 2-minute subtask of the second task and then solving the 3-minute subtask of the second task. 

Therefore, the program will return an incorrect result for this input.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming, to consider all possible ways of solving the subtasks and find the optimal solution.

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to correctly solve the problem:

```python
import sys
import itertools

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))

result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    max_points = 0
    for tasks in range(n + 1):
        for subtasks in itertools.product(range(k + 1), repeat=tasks):
            time_used = sum([sum(t[:subtask]) for subtask in subtasks])
            points = sum([min(subtask, k) for subtask in subtasks]) + sum([1 for subtask in subtasks if subtask == k])
            if time_used <= M:
                max_points = max(max_points, points)
            else:
                break
    return max_points
```

This modified program uses dynamic programming to consider all possible ways of solving the subtasks and finds the optimal solution. However, please note that this program may not be efficient for large inputs due to its exponential time complexity. A more efficient solution would be to use a more advanced algorithm or data structure, such as a priority queue or a heap, to find the optimal solution.
