Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly determines the result of the voting based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible number of upvotes and downvotes by considering the unknown votes as either upvotes or downvotes.

The program then checks the following conditions:

- If the maximum possible number of upvotes is less than the minimum possible number of downvotes, it prints '-'. This means that even if all unknown votes are upvotes, the total number of upvotes will still be less than the total number of downvotes.
- If the maximum possible number of downvotes is less than the minimum possible number of upvotes, it prints '+'. This means that even if all unknown votes are downvotes, the total number of downvotes will still be less than the total number of upvotes.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints '?'. This means that the outcome is uncertain because there are possible scenarios where the total number of upvotes and downvotes can be equal or different, depending on how the unknown votes are cast.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of upvotes, downvotes, or unknown votes is zero. It also correctly handles cases where the number of unknown votes is greater than the difference between the number of upvotes and downvotes, which can lead to an uncertain outcome.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
