Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 and calculates the total cost of changing the lengths of the sticks to be almost good for the current `t`. It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` value.

The program correctly handles the cases where the stick length is less than `t - 1` or greater than `t + 1` by adding the difference to the current cost. It also correctly handles the cases where the stick length is already almost good for the current `t` by not adding any cost.

The program's time complexity is O(n * 100), where n is the number of sticks, which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem. The space complexity is O(1), which is also acceptable.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem and handles all possible cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
