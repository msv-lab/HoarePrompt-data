Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to change the lengths of the sticks so that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer `t`. 

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The program iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100, which covers all possible lengths of the sticks.

2. For each `t`, it calculates the cost of changing the lengths of the sticks so that they are almost good for `t`. This is done by checking if the length of each stick is less than `t - 1` or greater than `t + 1`, and if so, adding the difference to the current cost.

3. The program keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` value, and updates them whenever it finds a smaller cost.

4. Finally, the program prints the `t` value and the minimum cost.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when all sticks have the same length, or when the sticks have lengths that are already almost good for some `t`. 

The time complexity of the program is O(n * 100), where n is the number of sticks, which is reasonable given the constraints of the problem. 

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
