Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

```
3 250 185 230
0 20 250
```

The program will output:

```
2
185 230
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
1
230
```

or

```
1
20
```

Because adding a mark at 20 or 230 centimeters would allow Valery to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters.

The issue with the program is that it checks if the distances x and y can be measured by checking all pairs of marks. If a distance cannot be measured, it adds the distance to the list of additional marks. However, it does not consider the case where adding a mark at a distance less than x or y could allow both distances to be measured. 

The program also incorrectly adds marks to the list of additional marks. It checks if the sum of a mark and an additional mark is less than or equal to the length of the ruler and not already a mark. If so, it adds the sum to the list of additional marks. However, this is not necessary and can result in incorrect output. 

To fix the program, it should check all possible combinations of additional marks and determine which combination allows both distances x and y to be measured with the minimum number of additional marks. 

Here is a correct version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    if need_x and need_y:
        print(0)
    elif need_x:
        if y in marks:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(1)
            print(y)
    elif need_y:
        if x in marks:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(1)
            print(x)
    else:
        if x + y in marks:
            print(1)
            print(x)
        elif y - x in marks:
            print(1)
            print(y)
        elif x - y in marks:
            print(1)
            print(x)
        else:
            print(2)
            print(x, y)
