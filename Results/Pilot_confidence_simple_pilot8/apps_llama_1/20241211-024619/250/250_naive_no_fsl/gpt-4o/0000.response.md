Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly determines the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure the distances x and y.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first checks if the distances x and y can be measured using the existing marks on the ruler. If both x and y can be measured, it prints 0 and does not add any new marks.

2. If either x or y cannot be measured, it checks if adding a single mark can allow both x and y to be measured. It does this by checking if there is a mark that is x or y away from another mark, and if adding a mark at that distance would allow both x and y to be measured.

3. If adding a single mark is not enough, it adds the minimum number of marks necessary to measure both x and y. This is done by adding marks at distances x and y from the origin, if necessary.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

- When both x and y can be measured using the existing marks.
- When one of x or y can be measured, but the other cannot.
- When neither x nor y can be measured, but adding a single mark can allow both to be measured.
- When neither x nor y can be measured, and adding multiple marks is necessary.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when x or y is equal to the length of the ruler.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
