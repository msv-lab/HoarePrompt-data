To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1(lst, L)` and see if it adheres to the problem requirements.

The function is supposed to:
1. Take a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
2. Split the list into two parts:
   - The first part should have a length of `L`.
   - The second part should contain the remaining elements of the list after the first `L` elements.
3. Return these two parts as a tuple.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Case when `L` is 0**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)`
   - Expected Output: `([], [1, 2, 3])`
   - Actual Output: `([], [1, 2, 3])` (works correctly)

2. **Case when `L` is greater than the length of the list**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`
   - Expected Output: `([1, 2, 3], [])`
   - Actual Output: `([1, 2, 3], [])` (works correctly)

3. **Case when `L` is equal to the length of the list**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 3)`
   - Expected Output: `([1, 2, 3], [])`
   - Actual Output: `([1, 2, 3], [])` (works correctly)

4. **Case when the list is empty**:
   - Input: `func_1([], 2)`
   - Expected Output: `([], [])`
   - Actual Output: `([], [])` (works correctly)

All examined cases yield the expected results, indicating the function behaves correctly according to the problem description.

Therefore, we conclude that the program meets all specified requirements without failing for any edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
