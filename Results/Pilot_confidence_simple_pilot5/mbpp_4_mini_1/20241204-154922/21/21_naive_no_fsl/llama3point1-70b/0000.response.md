Correctness: **False**

The provided program uses the `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. However, it does not handle the case when the input list `nums` is empty. Calling `min()` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`, which means the function does not meet the requirement of finding the smallest number in a list for all potential cases. 

For example, if we call `func_1([])`, the program will throw an error instead of returning a valid result. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible inputs as specified in the problem description.
