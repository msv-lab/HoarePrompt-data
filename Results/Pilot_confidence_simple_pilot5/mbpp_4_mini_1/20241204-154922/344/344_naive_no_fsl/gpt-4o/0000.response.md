Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module is used, which finds the position in the sorted list where the given value should be inserted to maintain the order. This function behaves as expected across various scenarios:

1. When the value is greater than all elements in the list (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, indicating that `6` should be inserted at the end).
2. When the value is between two existing elements (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, indicating that `3` should be inserted after `2`).
3. When the value is greater than the largest element in the list (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` again returns `4`, consistent with the previous case).

All edge cases have been considered and handled correctly. As a result, I find no potential cases where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, confirming the correctness of the implementation.
