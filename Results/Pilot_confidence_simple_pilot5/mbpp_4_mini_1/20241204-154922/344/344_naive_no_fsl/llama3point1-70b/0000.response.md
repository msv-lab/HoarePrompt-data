To determine if the provided program meets the problem description of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, we must consider edge cases and analyze the logic in the code.

The function `func_1(sorted_list, value)` iterates through the `sorted_list` and returns the index `i` where the first element is greater than or equal to `value`. If all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`, it returns `len(sorted_list)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Case where `value` is less than the smallest element**: 
   - For example, if `sorted_list = [2, 3, 4]` and `value = 1`, the function should return `0`, as `1` would be inserted at the start of the list.
   - The function correctly identifies that `1 < 2` and returns `0`.

2. **Case where `value` is equal to an element in the list**: 
   - If `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]` and `value = 2`, the function should return `1`, since that is the index of the first occurrence of `2`.
   - The function correctly compares and finds `2` at index `1`, thus returning `1`.

3. **Case where `value` is greater than the largest element**: 
   - For `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]` and `value = 4`, it should return `3` because `4` would be appended at the end.
   - The loop will complete without finding any element greater than or equal to `4`, and the function will correctly return `len(sorted_list)` which is `3`.

4. **Case with duplicate elements**: 
   - If `sorted_list = [1, 2, 2, 3]` and `value = 2`, it should return `1`, which is the first index of `2`.
   - The function checks index `0` (which is `1`), finds it's less than `2`, checks index `1`, finds it equal to `2` and returns `1`. This works correctly.

5. **Boundary case with an empty list**: 
   - If `sorted_list = []` and `value = 3`, the function should return `0` since `3` would be the first element.
   - The loop doesn't execute and the function directly returns `0` (which is `len(sorted_list)`). This is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The logic seems sound and handles various edge cases effectively. I cannot find a case where the function does not meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
