Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. It does this by iterating through the string with a step of 2, which effectively selects only the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This matches the requirement stated in the problem description. 

Here are some test cases to illustrate its correctness:

1. If `s = "abcdef"`, the output will be `"ace"` (characters at indices 0, 2, and 4).
2. If `s = "123456789"`, the output will be `"13579"` (characters at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8).
3. If `s = ""` (empty string), the output will also be `""`, which is correct since there are no characters to remove.

Since the function handles all cases correctly, including an empty string, the implementation is sound. There are no edge cases where the function fails the requirement specified in the problem description.
