To verify the correctness of the program, we need to examine both the problem description and the implementation of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description
The problem requires a function to count the occurrences of all elements from a list in a tuple. For example, if a tuple contains multiple occurrences of the elements in the list, we should sum those occurrences and return the total count.

### Program Analysis
The provided code includes the following function:

```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

This function iterates over each element in the `elements` list and uses the `count` method of the tuple `tup` to determine how many times each element appears in `tup`. It then sums these counts and returns the total.

### Testing the Function
Three assertions are provided to test the function:

1. `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])` should return `3` because 'a' appears twice and 'b' appears once (2 + 1 = 3).
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7])` should return `6` because '1' appears three times, '4' appears twice, and '7' appears once (3 + 2 + 1 = 6).
3. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2])` should return `2` because '1' appears once and '2' appears once (1 + 1 = 2).

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases that might not be covered:

1. **Empty Tuple**: If `tup` is empty and `elements` is non-empty, the function should return `0`.
   - Example: `func_1((), ['a', 'b'])` should return `0`.

2. **Empty Elements List**: If `elements` is empty regardless of `tup`, the function should return `0`.
   - Example: `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), [])` should return `0`.

3. **No Matching Elements**: If none of the elements in `elements` are found in `tup`, it should return `0`.
   - Example: `func_1(('a', 'b', 'c'), ['d'])` should return `0`.

4. **All Elements Missing**: If `tup` is empty and `elements` is also empty, it should return `0`.

### Conclusion
While the assertions provided for testing return valid results, the function does not handle cases where the tuple is empty or where the list of elements is empty. Therefore, we can conclude that the function is missing logic for these potential cases.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not work correctly for the case of an empty tuple or an empty list of elements.
