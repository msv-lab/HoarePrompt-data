Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It achieves this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then computing the difference between these two values.

Here's the reasoning behind this conclusion:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple `arr` as input and correctly computes the maximum difference by:
   - Finding the minimum value using `min(arr)`.
   - Finding the maximum value using `max(arr)`.
   - Calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

2. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases that verify the functionality of the code:
   - For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `5`, yielding a maximum difference of `4`.
   - For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, yielding a maximum difference of `8`.
   - For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, yielding a maximum difference of `2`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function will work correctly for any non-empty tuple of integers. It will raise an error if the input array is empty, but since the problem does not mention handling of empty arrays, this behavior is acceptable in the context provided. 

Since there are no identified cases where the function fails to meet the requirements described, the correctness is confirmed to be true.
