Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the angle of a complex number based on the given real and imaginary parts. The use of `cmath.phase` is appropriate for calculating the phase (or angle) of a complex number, which is defined as the arctangent of the imaginary part over the real part. 

In every potential case, such as:
1. A complex number with both real and imaginary parts (e.g., `real=1, imag=1`).
2. A purely real number (e.g., `real=2, imag=0`).
3. A purely imaginary number (e.g., `real=0, imag=3`).
4. A complex number with negative parts (e.g., `real=-1, imag=-1`).

The function will handle these scenarios correctly, consistently returning the angle in radians. The implementation adheres to the problem requirements, and I could not find any input cases where it would fail to deliver the correct angle. Thus, the program is accurate and meets the problem's description.
