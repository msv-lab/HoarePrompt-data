Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the provided tuple have the same data type. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Empty Tuple Case**: The function returns `True` for an empty tuple, which is consistent with the definition that all elements (zero in this case) can be considered of the same type.

2. **Type Checking**: The function establishes the type of the first element and then iterates through each element in the tuple to compare their types to the first element's type. If any type differs, it returns `False`.

3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions:
   - `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True`, which is correct since all are integers.
   - `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False`, which is correct since it contains both integers and a string.
   - `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True`, which is correct since all are integers.

The function handles all potential and edge cases efficiently, including the case of an empty tuple, and does not have any missing logic or edge cases that are not handled. Therefore, the implementation is correct as per the problem description.
