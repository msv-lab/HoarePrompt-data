To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` in the context of the provided problem description.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to write a function to check if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type.

### Program Analysis:
The given function `func_1` does the following:
1. It takes a tuple `tup` as input.
2. It uses a generator expression to get the type of each element in the tuple: `(type(x) for x in tup)`.
3. It creates a set from these types to eliminate duplicates.
4. Finally, it checks if the length of this set is 1, which would indicate that all elements are of the same type.

### Testing for Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Tuple:** `func_1(())`
   - Expected: Since there are no elements, it may be considered that all (zero) elements are of the same type.
   - Actual: `len(set()) == 0`, so it returns `False`. This is inconsistent with the expectation.

2. **Single Element Tuple:** `func_1((1,))`
   - Expected: A single element should be considered the same type.
   - Actual: `len(set((int,))) == 1`, so it returns `True`. This is correct.

3. **Mixed Types Tuple:** `func_1((1, 2.0, '3'))`
   - Expected: Should return `False` since the types are `int`, `float`, and `str`.
   - Actual: `len(set((int, float, str))) == 3`, so it returns `False`. This is correct.

4. **Same Type Tuple:** `func_1((1, 2, 3))`
   - Expected: Should return `True` since all are integers.
   - Actual: `len(set((int, int, int))) == 1`, so it returns `True`. This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the edge case of an empty tuple, where it incorrectly returns `False`, while logically it should return `True`.

Correctness: **False**
