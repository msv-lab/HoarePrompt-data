To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the implementation to see if it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \).

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes in a positive integer \( n \) and finds the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices from \( 0 \) to \( n \).

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(n)` implements this logic using a loop that iterates through all indices from \( 0 \) to \( n \). For each index \( i \), if \( i \) is even (i.e., \( i \% 2 == 0 \)), the function adds the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum.

### Verification of Correctness:
1. **Boundary Case (n = 1)**:
   - Expected result: \( \binom{1}{0} + \binom{1}{2} = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (since \( \binom{1}{2} = 0 \)).
   - Function output: `func_1(1)` returns `1`.
   - This is correct.

2. **Case (n = 2)**:
   - Expected result: \( \binom{2}{0} + \binom{2}{2} = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - Function output: `func_1(2)` returns `2`.
   - This is correct.

3. **Case (n = 3)**:
   - Expected result: \( \binom{3}{0} + \binom{3}{2} = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - Function output: `func_1(3)` returns `4`.
   - This is correct.

4. **Case (n = 4)**:
   - Expected result: \( \binom{4}{0} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{4} = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 \).
   - Function output: `func_1(4)` returns `8`.
   - This is correct.

5. **General Case**:
   - The function correctly calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for all even indices from \( 0 \) to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
After testing various cases, including edge cases and ensuring that the logic follows the requirements in the problem description, the function is working correctly for all tested inputs. There are no identified cases where the function fails to meet the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
