Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains leading or trailing underscores. For example:

- If the input is an empty string `''`, the function will return an empty string, which is not a valid camel case representation.
- If the input is a string with leading underscores like `'_snake_case'`, the output would be `'SnakeCase'`, which is incorrect since the leading underscore should not be present in a camel case representation.
- Similarly, if the input is a string with trailing underscores like `'snake_case_'`, the output would be `'SnakeCase'`, which is also incorrect for the same reason.

Since the function does not account for these edge cases, it does not fulfill the problem description completely.
