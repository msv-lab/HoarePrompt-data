Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width` parameters. The provided assertions test the function with valid positive integer inputs, and the results are correct according to the area formula (Area = Length * Width). 

Additionally, the function does not include checks for negative or zero values, but the problem description does not specify constraints on input values. Therefore, it is assumed that the inputs will always be valid positive numbers representing dimensions. Given the lack of any specified edge cases or constraints in the problem description, the function works correctly for the cases provided. 

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct for the scope defined by the problem statement.
