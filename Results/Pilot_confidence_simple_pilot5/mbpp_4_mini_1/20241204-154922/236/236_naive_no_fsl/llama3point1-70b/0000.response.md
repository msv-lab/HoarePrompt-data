Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. The function `func_1(nums)` compares the input list `nums` with the result of `sorted(nums)`. If the two are equal, it means that the list is already sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it is not sorted.

The function handles all potential cases:
1. An empty list `[]` is considered sorted.
2. A list with one element `[1]` is also considered sorted.
3. A list with multiple elements, whether they are in increasing, decreasing, or random order, will be accurately assessed.

Since I cannot identify any input or potential case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
