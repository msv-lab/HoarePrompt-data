Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle multiple occurrences of the substring in the string. According to the problem description, the function should find the occurrence and position of all substrings, but the code only finds the first occurrence. This means that if a string contains multiple instances of the substring, the code will not return all the relevant positions, which does not meet the requirement of the problem description.

For example, if we call `func_1("hello hello", "hello")`, the expected behavior would be to return the positions of both occurrences of "hello", but the program only returns the first occurrence `(substring, start, end - 1)` which results in `(hello, 0, 4)`. The occurrence at index 6 is completely ignored.

Thus, it fails to satisfy the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
