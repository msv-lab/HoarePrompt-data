Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks if there are any duplicate elements in the input array by comparing the length of the original array with the length of a set created from that array. However, the program returns `True` if there are duplicates (since `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` will be `True` when duplicates are present) and `False` if there are no duplicates. 

The problem description asks for a function to determine whether there are any duplicate elements, which implies that the function should return `True` when duplicates are found and `False` otherwise. 

Thus, the logic of the function is inverted relative to the requirement set by the problem description. For instance, calling `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return `False` because there are no duplicates, but instead, it will return `True`, indicating an error in the implementation.

Therefore, since the implementation does not fulfill the requirements as stated, the correctness is False.
