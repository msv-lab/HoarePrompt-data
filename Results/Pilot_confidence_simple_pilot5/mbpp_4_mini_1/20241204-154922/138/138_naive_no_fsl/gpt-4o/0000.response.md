Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array (`arr`) and an element (`element`) as inputs and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array and the index of that element. 

The function uses a for loop with `enumerate`, which effectively iterates over the array while keeping track of both the index and the value. If the value matches the element, it immediately returns `(True, index)`. If the loop completes without finding the element, it correctly returns `(False, -1)`.

The assertions provided in the code serve as test cases demonstrating that the function works for those specific examples. Since I cannot find any potential cases where the function fails to meet the description (for instance, it handles empty arrays, arrays without the element, and arrays with the element at various positions), I conclude that the implementation is correct.
