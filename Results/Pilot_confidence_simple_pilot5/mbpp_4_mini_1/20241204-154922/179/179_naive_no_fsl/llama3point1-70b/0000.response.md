To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

**Problem Analysis:**
The requirement is to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The first `n` even natural numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2n`. The program should compute the sum of the cubes of these numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

This function does the following:
1. It generates even numbers starting from 2 up to `2n` using `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`.
2. It computes the cube of each even number `i` in that range.
3. It returns the sum of these cubes.

**Testing Example Cases:**
1. For `n = 1`: 
   - The first even number is `2`.
   - The sum of cubes = 2^3 = 8. 
   - `func_1(1)` returns `8`, which is correct.

2. For `n = 2`: 
   - The even numbers are `2, 4`.
   - The sum of cubes = 2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72.
   - `func_1(2)` returns `72`, which is correct.

3. For `n = 3`: 
   - The even numbers are `2, 4, 6`.
   - The sum of cubes = 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288.
   - `func_1(3)` returns `288`, which is correct.

4. For `n = 0`: 
   - There are no even natural numbers to consider.
   - The expected sum of cubes = 0.
   - `func_1(0)` returns `0`, which is correct.

From these test cases, we can see that the function behaves as expected for both positive and zero values of `n`.

There are no edge cases or potential errors in the logic, as it correctly computes the cube sum for the specified range of even natural numbers.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers for all valid inputs.
