To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and the requirement closely.

**Problem Description**: Find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

The function `func_1` uses `set(lst)` to create a set of unique elements from the list `lst` and then calculates the sum of these unique elements. 

**Test Cases**:
1. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21`
   - Unique elements: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
   - Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 (Correct)

2. `assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71`
   - Unique elements: {1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 45}
   - Sum: 1 + 2 + 4 + 9 + 10 + 45 = 71 (Correct)

3. `assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78`
   - Unique elements: {2, 9, 10, 12, 45}
   - Sum: 2 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 45 = 78 (Correct)

### Analysis of the Logic
The key issue with the implementation is that it does not adhere to the requirement of summing **only the non-repeated elements**. The use of `set` means that any element that appears more than once is effectively ignored, which is incorrect based on the problem statement.

**Counterexample**:
Consider the input list `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The elements that are non-repeated are 1, 3, 4, and 5, so the expected sum should be 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13. However, using the current implementation:
- `set(lst)` would return {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and the sum would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program fails to correctly handle the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements. 

Correctness: **False**
