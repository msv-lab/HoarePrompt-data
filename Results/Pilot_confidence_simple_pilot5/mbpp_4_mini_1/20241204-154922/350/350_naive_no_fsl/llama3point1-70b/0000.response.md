Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the last position of an element (target) in a sorted array (arr). It does so by iterating through the array in reverse order, which ensures that the first occurrence of the target found will be the last occurrence in the original sorted array. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. The loop starts from the end of the array and moves towards the beginning.
2. If the current element matches the target, the index is returned immediately.
3. If the loop completes without finding the target, it returns -1, which correctly indicates that the target is not present in the array.

The program will return the correct index for various cases, including:
- If the target is present multiple times, the last occurrence will be correctly identified.
- If the target is not present at all, it will return -1 as expected.
- It handles the case where the array is empty by returning -1.

I could not find any potential cases where the program does not meet the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.
