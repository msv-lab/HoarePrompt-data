Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string. The function `func_1` uses the built-in string method `count`, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring. 

Here are the evaluations for the test cases provided:

1. `func_1('letstdlenstdporstd')` returns 3, which is correct as 'std' appears three times.
2. `func_1('truststdsolensporsd')` returns 1, which is correct as 'std' appears once.
3. `func_1('makestdsostdworthit')` returns 2, which is correct as 'std' appears twice.
4. `func_1('stds')` returns 1, which is correct as 'std' appears once.
5. `func_1('')` returns 0, which is correct as there are no occurrences of 'std' in an empty string.

All potential cases have been covered, including strings with no occurrences, multiple occurrences, and variations in string content. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
