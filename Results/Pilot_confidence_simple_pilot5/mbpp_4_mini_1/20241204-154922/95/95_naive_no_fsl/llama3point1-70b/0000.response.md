Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of counting the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The method `s.count('std')` accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring, which aligns with the problem description. 

For instance:
- For the input "std std std", the output will be 3, which is correct.
- For an input like "standard", the output will be 1, which is also correct.
- If the input string is "hello", the output will be 0, as 'std' does not occur in it.

Since I cannot find an example where the program fails to count occurrences of 'std' correctly, the implementation meets the specified requirements.
