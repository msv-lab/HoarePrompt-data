Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the elements of the list and checks each element with `isinstance(x, int)`. This approach accurately identifies integers and sums them up, returning the correct count.

All potential cases, such as lists containing only integers, mixed types, or empty lists, are handled correctly by the code. For example:
- An input of `[1, 2, 'a', 3.0]` would correctly return `2` because there are two integers.
- An input of `[]` would correctly return `0` since there are no elements in the list.

Since I cannot think of a case where the code does not perform as expected, the program is determined to be correct.
