Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list. 

- The function uses a generator expression that iterates through each element of the list and checks if it is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`.
- It sums up the results (which are `1` for each integer found) to return the total count of integers.

The provided test cases and reasoning behind them confirm its correctness:
- In the first test, `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])`, the integers are `1` and `2`, returning `2` as expected.
- In the second test, `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, all elements are integers, returning `3`.
- In the third test, `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])`, the integers are `1` and `4`, returning `2`.

I cannot think of any potential cases where the function would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, the function is correct.
