Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a character using the built-in `ord()` function in Python. The assertions included in the code verify that the function works correctly for the specific characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', which correspond to their respective ASCII values.

Since the `ord()` function handles all valid single characters correctly and there are no apparent edge cases that the code fails to address (for example, it would raise an error for non-string types or empty strings, which are not part of the problem description), the implementation is correct for the intended purpose of finding the ASCII value of a character.

Thus, the function adheres to the problem description, and no failing cases were identified.
