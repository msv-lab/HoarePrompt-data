Correctness: **False**

The program does not adhere to the problem description, which is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the maximum length and only the first sublist with that maximum length. 

This is problematic because the problem description requires all sublists of maximum length to be returned, not just the first one. For example, consider the input:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

The expected output should be:

```python
(3, [[3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]])
```

But the program will return:

```python
(3, [3, 4, 5])
```

Thus, it fails to return all sublists of maximum length, which violates the requirement of the problem description.
