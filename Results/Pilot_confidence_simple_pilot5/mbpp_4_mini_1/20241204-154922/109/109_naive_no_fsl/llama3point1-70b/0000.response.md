To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description. The problem states that we need to replace the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`).

Here is the provided function:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1:
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else:
        list1 = list2
    return list1
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Replacement Logic**:
   - The line `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` with the contents of `list2`. If `list2` has more than one element, it will replace the last element of `list1` with all of those elements, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description. The description implies that only the last element should be replaced, but the code allows for multiple elements to be inserted. 

2. **Handling Empty Lists**:
   - If `list1` is empty, the code attempts to set `list1` to `list2`, but this does not modify the original `list1` that was passed in. Instead, it creates a new local variable `list1` that does not affect the original list outside the function.

### Example Cases to Illustrate Issues:

- **Case 1**: If `list1` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `list2` is `[4, 5]`, the correct behavior according to the problem description would be to change `list1` to `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. However, the function will produce `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, which is technically correct but not aligned with the description which may imply a single replacement.

- **Case 2**: If `list1` is `[]` (empty list) and `list2` is `[4]`, the function will not modify the original `list1` and will return a new list that is `[4]`, which does not match the expected behavior of modifying `list1`.

### Conclusion:

The program has issues in two areas: 
1. It does not adhere strictly to the notion of replacing just the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.
2. It does not correctly handle the case when `list1` is empty, as it does not modify the original list passed in.

Given these observations, there are clear potential cases where the function does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
