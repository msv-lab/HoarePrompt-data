Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is intended to replace the last element of the first list with all the elements of the second list. However, the actual implementation of the function only takes all elements of `list1` except the last one (`list1[:-1]`) and concatenates it to `list2`. 

For example, when the inputs are `func_1([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`, the expected output should be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is handled correctly by the assertion. However, when the input is `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8])`, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and this is also handled correctly by the assertion. But if we check the input `func_1(['red', 'blue', 'green'], ['yellow'])`, the expected output should be `['red', 'blue', 'yellow']`, which is again handled correctly.

Despite the assertions passing, the function fails to replace the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`. Instead, it simply omits the last element of `list1`. For instance, if we call `func_1([1], [2, 3])`, the expected output should be `[2, 3]` (as we are replacing the only element with elements of the second list), but the actual output will be `[]` (since it will remove the last element of `list1` which is the only element). 

Thus, there are cases where the program does not behave as specified in the problem description.
