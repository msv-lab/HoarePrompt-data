To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1` and ensure it behaves as expected.

The problem description states that the function should check if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

Here are the assertions provided:
1. `func_1('pythonzabc.')` should return `True`. This input does contain 'z' in the middle of the string.
2. `func_1('zxyabc.')` should return `False`. This input has 'z' at the start of the string.
3. `func_1('  lang  .')` should return `False`. This input does not contain 'z' at all.

Now, let's analyze the implementation of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'z' in s[1:-1]:
        return True
    return False
```

### Analysis
- The function checks for the presence of 'z' in the slice of the string `s[1:-1]`, which is the string excluding the first and last characters.
- If 'z' is found in that slice, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Input with a single character**: `func_1('z')` should return `False` because it cannot check characters outside of the first and last (which are the same in this case). 
2. **Empty string**: `func_1('')` should return `False`, as there are no characters to check.
3. **Input with only 'z'**: `func_1('zz')` should also return `False` since the only characters present are at the start and end.
4. **Input with 'z' at both ends**: `func_1('zxyz')` should return `False` since 'z' is at both the start and end.
5. **Input with spaces**: `func_1(' z ')` should return `False`, as 'z' is at the edges when you include leading and trailing spaces.

### Conclusion
The function fails to handle the edge cases effectively. For example, the case `func_1('z')` should return `False`, but it is not explicitly tested or handled by the existing assertions. 

Given this analysis, the function does not meet the requirements for all potential cases as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
