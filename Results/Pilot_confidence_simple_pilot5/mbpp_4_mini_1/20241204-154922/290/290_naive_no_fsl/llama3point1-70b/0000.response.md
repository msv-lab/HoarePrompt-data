To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem description: "Write a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word."

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that splits the input string `s` into words and checks each word to see if it contains the letter 'z' within its internal characters (excluding the first and last characters). If any word meets this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Checking non-edge words**: The program checks each word with a length greater than 1, which is correct since single-character words cannot have 'z' in the middle. 
2. **Checking position of 'z'**: The condition `if 'z' in word[1:-1]` accurately checks if 'z' exists in the word excluding the first and last characters.
3. **Handling multiple words**: The program correctly processes multiple words by splitting the input string.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Case with 'z' at the start or end**: For example, the input "zapple" should return `False` because 'z' is at the start. The input "applez" should also return `False` because 'z' is at the end. Thus, the program should not return `True` for these inputs, which it does correctly.
- **Case with 'z' in the middle**: For the input "apzple", the function should return `True`, which it does.
- **Empty string**: The input "" should return `False` because there are no words to check.
- **Single character inputs**: For inputs like "z" or "a", the function should return `False`, which it does since these are not processed as long enough words.

After analyzing these scenarios, we observe that the program handles all specified cases correctly according to the problem description. 

Since I cannot identify any input or case where the function behaves incorrectly, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
