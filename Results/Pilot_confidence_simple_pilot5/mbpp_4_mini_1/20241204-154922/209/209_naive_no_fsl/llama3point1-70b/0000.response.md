To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function's behavior with various inputs.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that returns the first element of each sublist in a list of sublists.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Analysis:
1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each `sublist` in the input `sublists` and return the first element of each `sublist` using `sublist[0]`.

2. **Potential Edge Case**: 
   - If a `sublist` is empty (`[]`), accessing `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`.
   - For example, if `sublists` is `[[], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`, the function will attempt to access `sublist[0]` for the first sublist (which is empty) and will raise an error.

Given this edge case, the function does not fulfill the requirement to safely extract the first element of each sublist, since it does not handle empty sublists.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where one or more sublists may be empty, leading to an `IndexError`.
