Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list based on the problem description. It employs a list comprehension that iterates through the list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd (`num % 2 != 0`). 

I have checked the example assertions provided in the code:
1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, it returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which is correct.
2. For the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, it returns `[45, 67, 93]`, which is also correct.
3. For the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, it returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which is correct as well.

Furthermore, the function should handle various cases, including:
- An empty list, which should return `[]`.
- A list with no odd numbers, which should return `[]`.
- A list with all odd numbers, which should return the original list.

Since I could not find any case where the function fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, the function is correct.
