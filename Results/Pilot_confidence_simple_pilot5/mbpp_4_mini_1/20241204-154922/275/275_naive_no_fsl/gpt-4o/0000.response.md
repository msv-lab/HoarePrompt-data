To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it successfully finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in that subset is divisible.

### Code Analysis

The function `func_1` does the following:

1. **Handles empty input**: If the input list `nums` is empty, it correctly returns `0`.
2. **Sorts the numbers**: The list is sorted to facilitate checking divisibility.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`.
4. **Nested Loop for Pair Checking**: The outer loop iterates through each number, while the inner loop checks all previous numbers to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, it updates `dp[i]` with the maximum value of the current `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.

5. **Returns Result**: Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

### Testing Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases:

1. **Single Element**: `func_1([2])` should return `1` since a single element is trivially divisible by itself.
2. **All Elements Divisible**: `func_1([2, 4, 8, 16])` should return `4` because every number is divisible by 2.
3. **No Elements Divisible**: `func_1([3, 5, 7])` should return `1` since no two numbers are divisible by each other (the largest subset is any single number).
4. **Mixed Values**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12])` should return `4` because the largest subset is `{1, 2, 4, 12}`.

Now, let's verify the cases:

1. **Single Element**: 
   - `func_1([2])` → Returns `1` which is correct.
   
2. **All Elements Divisible**: 
   - `func_1([2, 4, 8, 16])` → Returns `4` which is correct.

3. **No Elements Divisible**: 
   - `func_1([3, 5, 7])` → Returns `1` which is correct.

4. **Mixed Values**: 
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12])` → Returns `4` which is correct.

### Conclusion

No examples have been found where the program does not meet the problem’s requirements or any edge cases that cause it to fail. Therefore, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
