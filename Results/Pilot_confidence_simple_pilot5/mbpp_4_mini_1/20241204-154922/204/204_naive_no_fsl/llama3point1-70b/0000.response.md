Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential input cases as described. Specifically, it does not account for invalid month numbers (e.g., negative numbers or numbers greater than 12). For instance, if the input is 0 or 13, the function will incorrectly return `False`, even though these values are invalid inputs for a month. Additionally, it does not return `False` for month numbers that do not exist (e.g., 14, -1).

Thus, there are cases where the program does not fulfill the requirement of determining if a given month number has 31 days, as it does not handle invalid inputs properly.
