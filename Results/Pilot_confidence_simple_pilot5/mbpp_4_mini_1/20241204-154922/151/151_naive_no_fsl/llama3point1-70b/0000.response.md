Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively iterating through each element. If an element is a list, it calls itself to flatten that sublist, and then extends the `flat_list` with the flattened result. If the element is not a list, it appends that element directly to `flat_list`.

This approach handles all potential cases of nested structures, including:

1. Flat lists (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
2. Nested lists of varying depths (e.g., `[1, [2, [3, 4]], 5]`).
3. Empty lists (e.g., `[]`).
4. Lists containing mixed data types (e.g., `[1, 'a', [2, [3.0]]]`).

Since the logic comprehensively addresses all cases without missing conditions, the code operates correctly for all potential inputs. Thus, there are no scenarios where the program fails to perform as described.
