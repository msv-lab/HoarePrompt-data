To verify the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

**Problem Description:**
The function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. 

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The program uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the input tuples, which means it groups all elements at the same index from each tuple together.
2. For each group of values (`val`), it calculates the sum and divides it by the number of tuples (`len(tuples)`) to find the average for that index.

**Considerations:**
- The program appears to work correctly for tuples of equal lengths.
- However, there's a case we need to consider: what if the tuples are of different lengths? 

**Example Case:**
Let's check the edge case where the input is a tuple of tuples of different lengths:
```python
input_data = ((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))
```
In this case, `zip(*tuples)` will only group the elements that exist, leading to an output that may not represent the average for all intended positions.

The output for this input would lead to:
- `zip(*input_data)` would result in `((1, 3), (2, 4))` since the second tuple has an extra element.
- Calculating the averages would yield `[2.0, 3.0]`, which means the average for the second position (5) is completely ignored.

Thus, the program does not handle tuples of different lengths and will produce incorrect results.

Given this analysis, the program does not fulfill the problem requirement for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
