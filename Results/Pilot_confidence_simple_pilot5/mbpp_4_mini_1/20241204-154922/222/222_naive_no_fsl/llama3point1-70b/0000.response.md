Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description, which states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the program only retains uppercase characters, effectively ignoring lowercase substrings entirely rather than removing them.

For example, given the input string `"HelloWorld"`, the expected operation would result in removing the lowercase substrings, but the program would return `"HW"` instead of an empty string `""`, which is not correct according to the problem description.

Thus, the program fails to handle the requirements properly.
