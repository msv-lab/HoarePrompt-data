Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, retaining only the uppercase characters. The logic implemented in the function correctly iterates through each character in the input string, checking if it is uppercase using the `char.isupper()` method. If the character is uppercase, it is included in the result; otherwise, it is excluded.

The assertions provided in the code test various cases:
1. `func_1('PYTHon')` correctly returns `'PYTH'`.
2. `func_1('FInD')` correctly returns `'FID'`.
3. `func_1('STRinG')` correctly returns `'STRG'`.

Additionally, the function correctly handles inputs such as:
- An empty string, which would return an empty string.
- A string with no uppercase letters, which would return an empty string.
- A string with all uppercase letters, which would return the same string.

Since the logic correctly addresses the problem description and all potential edge cases, I conclude that the function is correct.

Hereâ€™s a further rationale:
- The function will filter out any lowercase characters, returning only the uppercase characters as intended.
- There are no overlooked edge cases, and the function behaves as expected for any valid input string.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
