Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to find shared elements between two lists. However, it does not properly handle the case when either of the input lists is empty. 

For example:
- If we call `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])`, the expected output should be an empty tuple `()`, indicating that there are no shared elements. However, the function will return an empty set, which will be converted to an empty tuple `()`, which is technically correct but not covered in the provided assertions. 

Additionally, if we consider the case of duplicate elements in the lists:
- For `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])`, the expected output is `(2, 3)` as they are the shared elements. The program returns `(2, 3)` which is correct, but if we were to consider the presence of additional duplicates in either list, the program does not explicitly handle those cases in the assertions given.

Since the problem description does not specify how to treat empty lists or if duplicates should be considered, the lack of handling for these edge cases results in the conclusion that the program does not meet all potential requirements. Thus, it is considered incorrect.
