Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character from each string in the given tuple. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works for the tested cases. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:
- The function uses a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and returns the last character using `s[-1]`.
- The function handles typical cases where each string in the tuple has at least one character.

Since the problem description does not specify handling empty strings or tuples, we can assume that the input will always meet these conditions. Therefore, for the provided examples and typical usage scenarios, the function behaves as expected in extracting the last character of each string.

No counterexamples or edge cases have been found that would break the function under the assumptions made based on the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
