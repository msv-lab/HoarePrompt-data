Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. It uses the XOR operation (`^`) to compare the two numbers, which results in a binary number where each bit is set to `1` if the corresponding bits of the input numbers are different and `0` if they are the same. The function then counts the number of `1`s in the resulting binary representation using `bin(...).count('1')` and checks if this count equals `1`. 

This means that if the count is `1`, it confirms that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. If the count is not `1` (i.e., it could be `0` or greater than `1`), it indicates that they differ at either no bits or more than one bit position.

The function works correctly in all cases:
1. For example, `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because `2` (binary `10`) and `3` (binary `11`) differ at one bit.
2. Conversely, `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` because `2` (binary `10`) and `4` (binary `100`) differ at more than one bit.

Since I cannot find any case where this logic fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
