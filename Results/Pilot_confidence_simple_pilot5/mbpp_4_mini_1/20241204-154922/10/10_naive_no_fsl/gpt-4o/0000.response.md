Correctness: **True**

The function provided correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula for the area of a triangle (0.5 * base * height) multiplied by the length of the prism. The assertions provided are all valid test cases that confirm the function behaves as expected for those inputs.

1. For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the base area is 0.5 * 10 * 8 = 40, and the volume is 40 * 6 = 240, which matches the expected output.
2. For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the base area is 0.5 * 3 * 2 = 3, and the volume is 3 * 2 = 6, which matches the expected output.
3. For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the base area is 0.5 * 1 * 2 = 1, and the volume is 1 * 1 = 1, which matches the expected output.

All edge cases are handled properly, such as base or height being zero (resulting in a volume of 0), and negative values for base, height, or length are not addressed explicitly but would logically yield a negative volume, which is not physically interpretable as volume. However, based on the context given, the function is designed to expect positive values for base, height, and length. 

Thus, since the function satisfies the requirements of the problem description and the provided cases, it can be concluded that the function is correct.
