Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is given by the formula:

\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
\]

where the base area \( \text{Base Area} \) of a triangle can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

Thus, the volume of the triangular prism can be expressed as:

\[
V = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h\right) \times l = \frac{b \times h \times l}{2}
\]

The function `func_1(b, h, l)` implements this formula correctly with the line `return b * h / 2 * l`. 

Therefore, for any values of \( b \), \( h \), and \( l \) that are non-negative, the function will return the correct volume, confirming that it adheres to the problem description across all potential cases.
