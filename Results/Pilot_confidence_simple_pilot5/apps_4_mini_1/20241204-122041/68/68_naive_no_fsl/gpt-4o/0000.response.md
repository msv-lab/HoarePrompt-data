To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function against the problem statement.

The program uses the following variables:
- `x`: Number of upvotes (known)
- `y`: Number of downvotes (known)
- `z`: Number of voters whose votes are unknown

It calculates:
- `min_upvotes`: The minimum number of upvotes, which is just `x`.
- `max_upvotes`: The maximum number of upvotes, which is `x + z`.
- `min_downvotes`: The minimum number of downvotes, which is just `y`.
- `max_downvotes`: The maximum number of downvotes, which is `y + z`.

The program then checks the following conditions:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it means that the maximum possible upvotes cannot exceed the minimum downvotes, therefore the result will be "-" (more downvotes).
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it means that the maximum possible downvotes cannot exceed the minimum upvotes, hence the result will be "+" (more upvotes).
3. If neither condition holds, it means that there could be different outcomes depending on how the unknown voters (z) vote, and thus the result is uncertain, indicated by "?"

Now, let's evaluate if this logic covers all possible scenarios described in the problem:

1. **Case 1 (More downvotes than upvotes)**: If `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`, then it correctly identifies `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` resulting in "-".
2. **Case 2 (More upvotes than downvotes)**: If `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`, it calculates `max_downvotes = 0` and `min_upvotes = 2`, leading to `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` and correctly returns "+".
3. **Case 3 (Equal upvotes and downvotes)**: For `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`, it finds that both sides are equal and returns "0".
4. **Case 4 (Uncertain outcome)**: For `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`, it finds that both `max_upvotes` and `max_downvotes` can lead to different results, returning "?".

Upon further inspection, there is a potential edge case that the code does not handle correctly:
- For `x = 0`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`, the maximum upvotes can be 1 (if the unknown voter upvotes) and minimum downvotes is 1. Thus, the result could be either "+" or "-", which makes it uncertain. However, the program would incorrectly categorize this as uncertain due to how the checks are structured.

In conclusion, while the program correctly handles the provided examples, it does not account for all possible outcomes as required by the problem description in specific situations.

Thus, I conclude:
Correctness: **False**
