Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to determine whether it is possible for Mishka to switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland is lit during every second after switching on. However, the logic used in the program is flawed.

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` using a function `func_1` which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD). Then it checks if the calculated LCM is divisible by each of the intervals. This approach does not correctly check for the presence of lit garlands at every second after the maximum starting time. 

A counterexample to demonstrate the flaw is as follows:
- Input: `1 1 2`
In this case, `k1 = 1`, `k2 = 1`, and `k3 = 2`. The program would compute the LCM to be `2` and it would output `YES` because `2 % 1 == 0` for both `k1` and `k2`, and `2 % 2 == 0`. However, if we switch on the first two garlands at `x1 = 1`, `x2 = 1`, and any `x3`, then from `t = 1` onwards, both garlands are lit in every second. The issue arises when `x1` and `x2` are both `1` and `x3` is `2`, which means at `t = 2`, the first two garlands are still lit, but if we chose `x3` to be `3`, it does not cover `t = 3`. 

Thus, the program does not accurately determine if at least one garland will be lit for every second after the maximum of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`. Therefore, the logic is flawed and the program does not fulfill the requirements set by the problem description for all potential cases.
