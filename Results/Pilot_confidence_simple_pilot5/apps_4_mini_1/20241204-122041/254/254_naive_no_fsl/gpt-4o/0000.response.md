To verify the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we must analyze the logic implemented in the code, particularly how it relates to the requirements stated.

The problem description requires that Mishka can choose three integers \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) such that for every second after the maximum of these three integers, at least one garland is lit. The garlands have different intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) which dictate their lit timings.

The provided program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \). The logic used in the program states that if the GCD of these three numbers is 1, then it is possible to choose the moments of time such that every second is covered by at least one garland being lit. If the GCD is greater than 1, it returns "NO".

However, using GCD as a sole measure does not adequately ensure that there is continuous coverage for all seconds beyond the maximum of \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). The program misses cases where the intervals might not allow coverage of every second even if their GCD is not 1.

### Example Case:
Consider the intervals \( k_1 = 3, k_2 = 3, k_3 = 3 \):
- The GCD of \( 3, 3, 3 \) is \( 3 \).
- The program will output "NO".
- But with \( x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 1 \), the garland will be lit at 1, 4, 7, etc., meaning every second after the first is not lit.

This example shows that thereâ€™s a configuration where Mishka can make the garlands light up every second but the program fails to identify this situation because it solely relies on the GCD.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine if it is possible to ensure at least one garland is lit every second after \( \max(x_1, x_2, x_3) \) based on the given conditions. 

Thus, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
