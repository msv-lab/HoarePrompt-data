Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not satisfy the problem description. The problem requires counting the number of distinct weights of all possible splits of an integer `n`, but the code simply counts the number of divisors of `n`. 

For instance, when `n = 7`, the expected output is `4` because the possible weights of splits are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`. However, if we run the provided program with `n = 7`, it will return `4`, which coincidentally matches the expected output. 

Yet, for other values of `n`, particularly values not prime, the output will not correspond to the number of distinct weights of splits. For example:
- If we test the program with `n = 8`, the expected output is `5`, but the actual output for `n = 8` will also be `4` (the number of divisors of `8` is `4`, those being `1, 2, 4, and 8`). This is incorrect as there are actually more distinct weights.

Thus, the program does not accurately reflect the requirements of the problem, leading to inconsistency in results for values of `n` that are not prime.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for multiple cases, and hence we conclude with:

Correctness: **False**
