Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. 

### Problem with the Program:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The program initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, but the logic for calculating points based on completed tasks is flawed.
   
2. **Counting Points**: The logic used to calculate total points is incorrect. It sums up the values in `dp` and adds points for completed tasks incorrectly. The approach of summing `dp[i][M]` does not properly account for the total points accrued from both complete tasks and subtasks solved.

3. **Example Case Not Handled**: For the input case where `n = 3`, `k = 4`, `M = 11`, and `t = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the program calculates points based on solving all tasks rather than maximizing points through selective subtask completion. The expected output is `6`, but the logic leads to incorrect counting of subtasks and completed tasks.

### Example Input to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
- Input:
  ```
  3 4 11
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- Expected Output: `6`
- Actual Output from the Program: (would require running the program to find the exact output, but it leads to incorrect counting as described).

Given these flaws, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement for various scenarios. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
