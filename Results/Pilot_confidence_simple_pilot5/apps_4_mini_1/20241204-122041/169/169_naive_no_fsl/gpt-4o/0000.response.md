Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the series of operations defined by the input string `s`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `stones` is initialized to 0, which represents the current number of stones in the pile.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation:
     - If the operation is `+`, it increases the count of `stones` by 1.
     - If the operation is `-`, it decreases the count of `stones` by 1 but ensures that it does not drop below 0 by using `max(0, stones - 1)`.

3. **Output**: After processing all operations, it prints the total number of stones.

The logic in the program adheres to the problem description:
- The pile must not be empty before a `-` operation, and the program ensures that by preventing `stones` from going below 0.
- For every sequence of operations, the program calculates the final count correctly based on the operations provided.

All provided examples in the problem description yield the correct output when tested with this program, and the logic accounts for all cases without missing any edge cases. Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
