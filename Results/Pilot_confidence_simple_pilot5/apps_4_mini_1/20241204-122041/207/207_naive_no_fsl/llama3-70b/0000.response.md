To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic used in the function to ensure that it accurately computes the required sum \( \sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) \).

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The function reads three integers \( m, a, b \).
   - An array `dp` of size \( m + 1 \) is initialized to track the number of distinct integers the frog can reach from each position.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - It sets `dp[0]` to 1, indicating the frog can reach position 0.
   - The function attempts to fill the `dp` array by iterating over all positions from 0 to \( m \):
     - If the frog can jump forward to \( i + a \), it adds the number of ways to reach \( i \) to \( dp[i + a] \).
     - If the frog can jump backward to \( i - b \), it adds the number of ways to reach \( i - b \) to \( dp[i] \).

3. **Final Output**:
   - It prints the sum of all elements in the `dp` array.

### Analysis of Potential Issues:
The core issue lies in the way that the frog's movement is modeled. The logic used in the loop does not correctly account for the constraints on the frog's movements:
- The backward jump should not contribute to `dp[i]` itself; instead, it should update `dp[i-b]`.
- The summation of `dp` does not necessarily represent `f(i)`, which is the total number of distinct integers reachable in the range [0, i].

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case where \( m = 0 \)**:
   - Input: `0 1 1` should yield `f(0) = 1`.
   - The output should be `1`, which matches the expected behavior.

2. **Case where \( a \) is much larger than \( m \)**:
   - Input: `2 5 1` should yield that the frog can only reach position 0, hence \( f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1 \), summing to `3`. The program will incorrectly compute this.

3. **Case where backward jumping is not possible**:
   - Input: `5 1 10` should show that only positions 0 to 5 are reachable, resulting in an incorrect computation since the backward jump exceeds the index.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly and incorrectly computes `f(i)` values due to the mishandling of backward jumps, leading to incorrect summation results. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
