To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description and identify whether it handles all potential cases correctly.

1. **Understanding `f(x)`**: The function `f(x)` is intended to calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach from position `0` without jumping outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `a` units forward or `b` units backward. 

2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The function `func_1` calculates the GCD of `a` and `b`. The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of GCD(`a`, `b`). If the GCD is greater than `1`, the program recursively calls `func_2` with scaled-down values, which should be correct as it reduces the problem size.

3. **Calculating `f(x)`**: In the `func_2`, the logic distinguishes between two cases:
   - If `m < k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), it calculates the sum of integers from `0` to `m`, which is correct as the frog can only reach positions between `0` and `m`.
   - If `m >= k`, it calculates distinct reachable positions differently, summing contributions from both `k` and the range from `k` to `m`.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the case where `a = 1` and `b = 1`. The frog can effectively reach every integer from `0` to `m`, which should return `m + 1` distinct integers. The formula used in the program should yield the correct result.
   - For cases where `m < k` and `m` is small compared to `a` and `b`, it should still be able to count correctly.
   - If `a` and `b` are very large, ensuring that the program can handle the maximum input size without overflow or performance issues.

5. **General Check Against Examples**:
   - The provided examples return expected results based on reasoning about how the frog can reach different positions.
   - The program correctly implements the summation as indicated in the problem description.

After analyzing the code and checking for edge cases, I did not find any instance or case where the logic fails or does not follow the problem statement.

Thus, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True**
