To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we can analyze how the program functions.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers on each side that are affected when one skewer is turned). The logic implemented in the function is as follows:

1. It initializes an empty list `positions`, which will store the indices of the skewers that Miroslav will turn over.
2. A while loop iterates as long as `i` (starting from 1) is less than or equal to `n`. On each iteration:
   - It appends the current skewer index `i` to the `positions` list.
   - It increments `i` by `2 * k + 1`, which represents the total number of skewers affected by turning skewer `i` (the skewer itself plus `k` skewers to the left and `k` skewers to the right).
3. Finally, it prints the length of the `positions` list and the skewer indices stored in `positions`.

Letâ€™s consider a few edge cases:

1. **Case when `n = 1` and `k = 0`**: 
   - Expected output: 1 action needed (turn skewer 1).
   - Program output: The program will output `1` and `1`, which is correct.

2. **Case when `n = 6` and `k = 1`**:
   - Expected output: 2 actions are needed (turn skewers 2 and 5, which will cover all skewers).
   - Program output: `2` and `2 5`, which is correct.

3. **Case when `n = 7` and `k = 2`**:
   - Expected output: 2 actions are needed (turn skewers 1 and 5 or similar).
   - Program output: The program will output `2` and `1 6`, which indeed covers all skewers, hence it's correct.

4. **Case when `n = 5` and `k = 1`**:
   - Expected output: 2 actions needed (turn skewers 2 and 5, or similar).
   - Program output: The program will output `2` and `1 4`, which does not turn skewer 3. Here the program fails to cover all skewers. 

From the edge cases, we see that the specific case of `n=5` and `k=1` shows that the program does not handle all required skewers correctly. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem description in all potential scenarios. 

Correctness: **False**
