Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, it only checks for the case where both Petya and Vasya can receive exactly `n/2` cards each, but it misses scenarios where the counts of numbers on the cards are not exactly `n/2` for two distinct numbers.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
1
1
1
2
```

In this case, the numbers on the cards are 1 (appearing three times) and 2 (appearing once). Petya and Vasya cannot select two distinct numbers such that they both get an equal number of cards (which should be 2 each). However, the program would incorrectly print "NO" without checking that there are at least two distinct numbers present to even attempt a fair game.

Additionally, the program would also fail in cases where more than two distinct integers are present but they do not distribute evenly to allow a fair game. For example:

```
6
2
2
3
3
4
4
```

Here, the numbers that could potentially be chosen (2, 3, 4) would not lead to a situation where Petya and Vasya can split the cards evenly.

Thus, since the program doesn't handle all potential cases and may lead to incorrect conclusions based on the distribution of card numbers, it is deemed incorrect.
