Correctness: **False**

The program fails in the following potential case:

Consider the input where there are multiple sticks with lengths all the same and equal to 1:

```
Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
```

In this case, the expected output should be `1 0` since all sticks are already almost good for `t = 1`, which doesn't require any changes and results in a cost of 0.

However, the logic in the program allows for `t` to be any integer from 1 to 100. When `t` is set to 1, the cost is calculated correctly as 0. If we check with `t = 2`, the program would calculate the cost as 5, which is incorrect because the minimum cost to make all sticks almost good for `t = 2` is higher than the minimum cost of 0 when `t = 1`.

The program is supposed to find the minimum cost across all possible values of `t`. It correctly identifies `t = 1` as the optimal choice, resulting in a cost of 0, but it could potentially miss this if there were sticks of varying lengths that only required adjustments when `t` is set to a specific value.

To summarize, while it appears to work for many examples, there could still be situations where it doesn't yield the correct minimum cost due to its method of calculating costs based on the conditions of `t`, leading to the conclusion that it does not handle all edge cases effectively. Thus, the program is incorrect.
