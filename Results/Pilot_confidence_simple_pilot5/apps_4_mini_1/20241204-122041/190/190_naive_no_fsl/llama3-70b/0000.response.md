Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the optimal value of `t` could be equal to `1`, which could potentially lead to a higher total cost when stretching or shrinking the sticks. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 1 100
```
In this case, the program will calculate `t` based on the median stick length, which is `1`. However, if `t` is chosen as `1`, then the cost to change the lengths of sticks `1, 1, 100` would be:
- Stick 1: `|1 - 1| = 0`
- Stick 2: `|1 - 1| = 0`
- Stick 3: `|100 - 1| = 99`

Total cost = `0 + 0 + 99 = 99`.

But if `t` was instead chosen as `2`, the cost would be:
- Stick 1: `|1 - 2| = 1`
- Stick 2: `|1 - 2| = 1`
- Stick 3: `|100 - 2| = 98`

Total cost = `1 + 1 + 98 = 100`, which is worse than choosing `t = 1`.

In this scenario, the optimal choice of `t` would not be found by this program, leading to a potential miscalculation of the minimum possible cost. Thus, the program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description for all possible cases.
