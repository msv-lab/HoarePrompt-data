Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to adequately check for all pairs of marks to ensure that both required distances \( x \) and \( y \) can be measured. Here are a few critical issues:

1. **Unconditional Set Operations**: The program uses a set for marks but does not correctly check for all possible combinations that could yield the required distances. It only checks for the presence of \( x \) and \( y \) based on simple additions to marks, which could miss valid combinations.

2. **Missing Possible Combinations**: The logic within the loops does not account for all pairs \( (i, j) \) such that \( a[j] - a[i] \) equals \( x \) or \( y \). For example, suppose the existing marks are \( [0, 50, 100] \), and we need to measure \( x = 70 \) and \( y = 80 \). The program may incorrectly conclude that additional marks are not needed or fail to identify the need for specific marks.

3. **Failure to Output Multiple Marks**: The program may not correctly determine when more than one mark needs to be added for each distance. It might incorrectly treat multiple missing marks as needing just one to be added instead of evaluating the full list of requirements.

### Example of Failure:
Given the input:
```
3 250 70 80
0 50 100
```
The expected output should indicate that both 70 and 80 are missing. The program may not correctly identify that neither distance can currently be measured and fails to add both marks.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to satisfy the problem requirements in all cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
