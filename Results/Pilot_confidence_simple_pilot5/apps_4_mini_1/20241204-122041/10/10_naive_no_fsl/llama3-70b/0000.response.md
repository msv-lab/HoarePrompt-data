To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step by step.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of sofas `d` and the dimensions of the storehouse `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads the coordinates for each sofa and stores them in a list named `sofas`.
   - Finally, it reads the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates how many sofas are to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa by comparing their coordinates.
   - This function compares the y-coordinates (for left/right) and x-coordinates (for top/bottom) to determine the counts.
   - The program then iterates over each sofa and uses the `func_1` function to get the counts.
   - If any sofa matches the specified counts, it prints the index of that sofa (1-indexed). If no sofa matches, it prints `-1`.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The counting logic in `func_1` only compares the first coordinate of the sofa tuple (`sofa[0]`), which represents only one part of the sofa. It fails to account for the second part of the sofa, which may also impact the counts.
   - Specifically, when a sofa occupies two cells horizontally or vertically, both positions must be considered for accurate counting. This means the current implementation may miss some sofas due to only checking one of the sofa's coordinates.

4. **Example Case to Test Failure**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     3
     3 3
     1 1 1 2
     1 2 1 3
     2 1 2 2
     1 1 1 1
     ```
     Here, the sofa at (1,1) to (1,2) has 0 to the left, 1 to the right, 1 on top, and 0 below. However, the counting logic would erroneously count the second sofa (1,2) to the right instead of checking the full placement (1,1)-(1,3). This discrepancy would lead to an incorrect count being reported, thus failing the criteria of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
