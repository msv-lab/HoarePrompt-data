Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Kolya can spend all his game-coins on houses, cars, and computers, based on the costs given in the problem description. 

Here’s a brief explanation of how it works:

1. The program reads the integer value `n`, which represents the total game-coins Kolya has.
2. It defines the costs of a house, a car, and a computer.
3. It uses nested loops:
   - The outer loop iterates over the number of houses (`a`) he could buy, ranging from 0 up to the maximum number of houses he can afford (`n // house_cost`).
   - The inner loop iterates over the number of cars (`b`) he could buy based on the remaining coins after buying houses.
   - For each combination of houses and cars, it checks if the remaining coins can be exactly divided by the computer's cost (`computer_cost`).
4. If it finds any valid combination where the remaining coins can be fully spent on computers, it returns "YES".
5. If it exhausts all possibilities without finding a solution, it returns "NO".

The logic covers all possible combinations of houses and cars, and it effectively checks the condition for computers. Furthermore, since the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) are handled efficiently due to the loops being bounded by the cost of the items, the program will evaluate all necessary cases without missing any.

Since I cannot find any specific case where the algorithm fails to deliver the correct result, I conclude that the program is correct.
