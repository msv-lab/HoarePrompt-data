Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`. The formula used, `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, does not account for the fact that the triangle must remain non-degenerate throughout the process.

For example, consider the input `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The expected output is `4`, as detailed in the problem description:

1. Start with (6, 6, 6)
2. Modify one side to (6, 6, 3) → 1 second
3. Modify another side to (6, 4, 3) → 2 seconds
4. Modify (6, 4, 3) to (3, 4, 3) → 3 seconds
5. Finally, modify (3, 4, 3) to (3, 3, 3) → 4 seconds

The program's logic fails because it assumes that the optimal process is simply reducing the side lengths without considering the order of operations and ensuring the triangle remains valid (non-degenerate). The program does not account for the constraints imposed by maintaining a non-degenerate triangle while modifying the sides. 

Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not provide the correct output, the correctness is deemed **False**.
