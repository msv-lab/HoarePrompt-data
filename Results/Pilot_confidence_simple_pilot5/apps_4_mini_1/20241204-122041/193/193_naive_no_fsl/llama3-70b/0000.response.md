Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of seconds needed to change the side length of an equilateral triangle from `x` to `y`, ensuring that at every step the triangle remains a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., the lengths of the sides remain positive).

The program simply computes `abs(x - y)`, which represents the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. However, this does not account for the fact that one cannot change all sides immediately to `y` in a single move, nor does it consider the intermediate steps that must maintain the triangle's properties.

For example, if we take the input `6 3`:
- According to the problem, the transitions would be `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`, taking 4 seconds. 
- The program would output `abs(6 - 3)`, which is `3`, incorrectly suggesting that only 3 seconds are needed.

Thus, this program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem and does not handle the necessary logic to ensure valid triangle modifications, leading to its incorrectness.
