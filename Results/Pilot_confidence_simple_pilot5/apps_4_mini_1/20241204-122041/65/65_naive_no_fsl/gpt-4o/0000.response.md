Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the distribution of baloons among friends when there are more baloons of a specific color than friends. The requirement is that no friend can receive two baloons of the same color. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3 1
aaa
```

In this case, there are 3 baloons of color 'a' and only 1 friend. The friend can only receive one baloon of color 'a', but he would be upset because there are still two remaining baloons of the same color. The expected output for this input should be "NO", but the program would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if the count of baloons per color is less than or equal to the number of friends, which is not sufficient to ensure that no friend receives two baloons of the same color. 

Therefore, since the program does not work correctly for this case, the final determination is that the correctness is **False**.
