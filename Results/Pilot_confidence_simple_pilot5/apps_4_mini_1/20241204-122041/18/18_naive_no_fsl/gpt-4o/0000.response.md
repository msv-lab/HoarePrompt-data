To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let’s analyze how it computes the number of standing spectators at time \( t \).

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads three integers: \( n \) (number of spectators), \( k \) (maximum number of spectators that can stand at the same time), and \( t \) (the time).
2. It includes three conditions:
   - If \( t \leq k \): It prints \( t \), which corresponds to the number of spectators standing since they would still be standing up to the \( k \)-th spectator.
   - If \( k < t \leq n \): It prints \( k \), meaning all \( k \) spectators are still standing because we have not yet reached a time where any of them would sit down.
   - If \( n < t < n + k \): It calculates how many spectators are standing by the formula \( n + k - t \). The reasoning here is that as time progresses past \( n \), spectators start to sit down.

### Edge Cases:
- Consider \( n = 10, k = 5, t = 6 \):
  - \( k < t \) so it should print \( k = 5 \), which is correct (5 spectators standing).
  
- Consider \( n = 10, k = 5, t = 5 \):
  - \( t \leq k \), so it should print \( 5 \), which is correct.

- Consider \( n = 10, k = 5, t = 11 \):
  - Here, \( n < t < n + k \) so it calculates \( n + k - t = 15 - 11 = 4 \). This means 4 spectators are standing, which matches the expected output.

### Testing Potential Errors:
Let’s examine some edge cases that might break the logic:

- For \( n = 10, k = 5, t = 1 \):
  - The program should return \( 1 \). This works.

- For \( n = 10, k = 5, t = 10 \):
  - It should return \( 5 \) (all spectators have stood up by time \( 10 \)). This also works.

- For \( n = 10, k = 5, t = 14 \):
  - The program computes \( n + k - t = 15 - 14 = 1 \), which indicates 1 spectator is standing. This is correct as only the first spectator would remain standing.

### Conclusion:
After running through all reasonable edge cases and the provided examples, the program consistently returns correct results as per the problem description. Thus, I cannot find any scenario in which the program fails.

Correctness: **True**
