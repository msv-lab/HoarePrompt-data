Correctness: **False**

The program has an issue with handling the input case where Limak's initial weight is equal to Bob's weight. According to the problem description, if Limak and Bob start with the same weight, Limak should still become larger after one year because he triples his weight while Bob only doubles his. 

However, in the provided code, when the input is `1 1`, the program will enter the loop since `a <= b` holds true, but after one year Limak's weight will be `3` and Bob's weight will be `2`, which is correct. So the program works for the input `1 1`, but the issue arises because the problem description explicitly states that Limak wants to be "strictly larger" than Bob. The current logic correctly accounts for this scenario but fails to consider the minimum edge cases when `a` is equal to `b`. 

However, if we test with `1 1` specifically, the output will be `1`, which aligns with the requirement that Limak should become larger after the first year.

But let's consider a critical case: if `a` starts at `b` (like `10 10`), the output should also be `1` after the first year since Limak's weight will become `30` while Bob's will become `20`. This indicates that the logic is not wrong. 

Upon further analysis, there doesn't seem to be an edge case where the given implementation fails to produce the correct outputs for the problem description. Therefore, the program handles all potential cases correctly.

Thus, the correct output should be:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic for weighing Limak and Bob year by year, ensuring Limak becomes strictly heavier than Bob as specified in the problem statement.
