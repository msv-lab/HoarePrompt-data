Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for negative angles and their correct transformation into the required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.

For example, let's consider the input `-60`. The expected output, as per the problem description, is `3`. This is because we need to rotate the image three times clockwise (270 degrees) to achieve a minimal deviation from the vertical. However, in the program, the calculation for `turns` is based on subtracting the normalized angle from 360, which does not correctly compute the number of 90-degree rotations for negative angles.

For an input of `-60`, the `normalized_angle` would be `300` (since `-60 % 360 = 300`), and the calculation `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4` would yield `0` turns, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to produce the correct output for at least this case, demonstrating that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
