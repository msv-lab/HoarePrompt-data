Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle a potential case where the total number of stones does not increase, but the distribution of stones does not allow for a valid transition from `x` to `y`. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
0 0 0 0 15
```

In this scenario, the total number of stones in the first visit is 15, and the total number of stones in the second visit is also 15. However, it is impossible to arrive at the second configuration with the given operations since there are not enough piles with stones that can be reduced to achieve the required counts in `y`. Thus, even though `total_y` is not greater than `total_x`, the output of the program will incorrectly state "Yes", while the correct answer should be "No". 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
