Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the journey involves moving East or West. According to the problem description, while Limak is allowed to move East or West, there is no indication that these movements should affect his latitude directly. However, the current implementation simply ignores these movements but does not check if such movements are valid at the given latitude.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
3
10000 South
5000 East
10000 North
```

- In this case, Limak moves 10,000 km South, reaching a latitude of -10. 
- Then he attempts to move 5,000 km East. The implementation does not check the validity of this East movement, but according to the problem description, Limak should still be able to move East or West without affecting his latitude.
- Finally, he moves 10,000 km North. However, since he started at -10 (after moving South), he could potentially violate the rule of only moving North if he's at the South Pole.

This highlights the absence of checks for valid East or West movements concerning the latitude constraints, leading to situations where the program may incorrectly approve an invalid journey.

Therefore, the current implementation cannot be deemed fully correct as it overlooks important conditions laid out in the problem description related to those lateral movements.
