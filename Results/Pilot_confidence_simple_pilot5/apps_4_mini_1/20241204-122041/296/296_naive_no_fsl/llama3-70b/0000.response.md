Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all cases. 

For example, consider the input `n = 4`. The expected output should be "YES" with a valid sequence of fractions that sum to \(1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\). 

However, the program only checks for the case when \(n = 2\) and defaults to returning "YES" for any \(n > 2\), without properly calculating the fractions. Specifically, when \(n = 4\), the program incorrectly outputs:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 4
```
The fractions \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), which is indeed correct, but the program does not account for \(b_i\) needing to be divisors of \(n\) and does not explore all potential values for \(b_i\). 

For \(n = 3\), the program would output:
```
YES
2
1 1
1 3
```
This combination is invalid since \(b_i\) must be greater than 1 and also must divide \(3\).

Thus, the program lacks comprehensive checks for valid divisors of \(n\) and fails to construct a valid output for all cases, leading to inconsistencies in its correctness based on the problem description.
