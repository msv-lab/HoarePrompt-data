Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to compute the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from the increasing array based on the gaps between the elements. However, it overlooks several key scenarios.

### Issues:
1. **Boundary Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the entire array is tightly packed (e.g., consecutive integers). In such cases, the maximum number of elements that can be erased will be limited by the need to leave at least one element as a reference for restoration. For example, in the case of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program will calculate the maximum gap as `1 - 1 = 0`, but the correct maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased is `4`, as you can erase all but one element.

2. **Start and End Elements**: The program only calculates the gaps between consecutive elements and does not consider the fact that one cannot erase elements from the start or the end of the array without losing the ability to restore it. If it tries to erase elements at the start or the end but does not account for preserving at least one boundary element, it can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Failure Case:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- The correct output should be `4` (as you can erase elements 2, 3, 4, leaving just `1` or just `5`).
- The program will output `0` because it only calculates the gaps between the elements.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem for all input cases.
