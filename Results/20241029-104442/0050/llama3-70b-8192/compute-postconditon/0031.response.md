Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `m` + 1, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to its current value plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, then `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
