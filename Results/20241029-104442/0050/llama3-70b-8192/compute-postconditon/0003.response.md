Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged. The list `b` is not affected by the sorting operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` contains the integers from the input split by spaces.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` contains the integers from the input split by spaces**
