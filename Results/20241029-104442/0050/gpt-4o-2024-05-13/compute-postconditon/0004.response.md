Example Answer: 
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from list `b`. The previous values of the variables are: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`. After execution, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`**
