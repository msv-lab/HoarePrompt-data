Example Answer:
`max_shares` is assigned the value of integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. The values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are positive integers. The output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is an integer calculated from `r` and `min_buy_price`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is an integer calculated from `r` and `min_buy_price`**
