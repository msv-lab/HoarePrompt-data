Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints**
