Example Answer:
`low` is assigned the value 0, and `high` is assigned the minimum value in list `v`. Since `v` is sorted in ascending order, the minimum value is the first element of the list. Therefore, `high` will be equal to the first element of list `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum value in list `v`**
