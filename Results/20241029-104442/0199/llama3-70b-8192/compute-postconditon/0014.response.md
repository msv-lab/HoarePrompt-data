Postcondition: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order. If the sum of min(mid, x) for x in v is less than s, `low` is assigned the value of `mid`; otherwise, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`.**
