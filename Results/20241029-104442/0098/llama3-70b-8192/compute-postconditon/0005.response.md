Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are integers. If the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a3` and `b3`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
