Example Answer: 
The `iterator` is assigned to an iterator object over the `possible_orientations` list. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`.
Output State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`**
