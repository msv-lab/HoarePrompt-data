Example Answer:
`speeds` is assigned a list of `t` zeros, where `t` is the value of `v1`, which is assigned to `t`. The value of `d` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros.
Output State: **`v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` is a list of `t` zeros**
