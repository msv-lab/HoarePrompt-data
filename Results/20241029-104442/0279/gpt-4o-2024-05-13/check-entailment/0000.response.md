Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters based on the given input values. It initializes the list of speeds, sets the speed at the first and last seconds, and calculates the speeds in between while ensuring that the absolute difference between adjacent speeds does not exceed the given maximum value. Finally, it calculates the total distance traveled by summing up the speeds at each second. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the output is correct.
