Example Answer:
`cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`, where `j` is not defined in the initial state. Since the value of `j` is unknown, we cannot determine the value of `c[j]`. Therefore, the output state is `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`, where `j` is undefined.
Output State: **`cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`, where `j` is undefined**
