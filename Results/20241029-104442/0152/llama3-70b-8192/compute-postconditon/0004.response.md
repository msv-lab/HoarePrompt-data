Example Answer:
The input is split based on spaces, converted to integers, and stored in list `c`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input**
