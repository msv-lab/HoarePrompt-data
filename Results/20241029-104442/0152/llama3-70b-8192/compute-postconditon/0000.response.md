Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are dependent on the user input, so the specific values cannot be determined without input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the user input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the user input**
