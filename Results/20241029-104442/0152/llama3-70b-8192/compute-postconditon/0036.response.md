Postcondition: **If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the program will continue without making any changes to the variables.**
Precondition: `num` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if num % 2 == 0:
    num += 1
else:
    num -= 1
```
Postcondition for if body: If `num` is an even integer, it will be incremented by 1.
Postcondition for else body: If `num` is an odd integer, it will be decremented by 1.
Postcondition: **`num` is an integer. If `num` is even, it will be incremented by 1; if `num` is odd, it will be decremented by 1.**
