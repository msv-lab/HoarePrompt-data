**Precondition:** **n, m, k, x, s are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9.**

**a, b are lists of integers where a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < x) and b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 2·10^9).**

**c, d are lists of integers where c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) and d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 2·10^9).**
