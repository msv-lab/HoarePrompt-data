Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of the 3rd element of `data` converted to an integer, which is `int(data[2])`. The value of `data` contains the split input values, so the value at index 2 is accessed. If the input values are 1, 2, 3, then `k` would be assigned 3. The variables `func`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer, `k` is an integer assigned the value of the 3rd element of `data`**
