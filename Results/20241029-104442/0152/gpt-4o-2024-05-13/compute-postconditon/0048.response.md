Example Answer:
The value of `remaining_potions` is calculated based on the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`. The previous values of `n` and `c[j]` are unknown, so the exact value of `remaining_potions` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers.
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers**
