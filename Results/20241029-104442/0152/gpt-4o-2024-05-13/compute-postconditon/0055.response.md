Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`, where `n`, `c[j]` are the initial values of `min_time`, `i` respectively. Since `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, the value of `c[j]` is valid. Therefore, the value of `remaining_potions` is determined by the calculation. 
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers and `j` is greater than or equal to 0; `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`**
