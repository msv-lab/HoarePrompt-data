Example Answer: 
The list `d` is created by mapping the `int` function to a sublist of `data` starting from index 5 + 2 * m + k up to 5 + 2 * m + 2 * k. The previous values of `data`, `m`, `k` are used to calculate the indices. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer, `k` is an integer assigned the value of the 3rd element of `data`, `x` is an integer, `s` is an integer value of the 5th element of `data`, a list `a` is created from a sublist of `data`, `b` is a list of integers converted from a sublist of `data`, `c` is a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function to a sublist of `data` starting from index 5 + 2 * m up to 5 + 2 * m + k, and `d` is a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function to a sublist of `data` starting from index 5 + 2 * m + k up to 5 + 2 * m + 2 * k.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer, `k` is an integer assigned the value of the 3rd element of `data`, `x` is an integer, `s` is an integer value of the 5th element of `data`, a list `a` is created from a sublist of `data`, `b` is a list of integers converted from a sublist of `data`, `c` is a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function to a sublist of `data` starting from index 5 + 2 * m up to 5 + 2 * m + k, and `d` is a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function to a sublist of `data` starting from index 5 + 2 * m + k up to 5 + 2 * m + 2 * k**
