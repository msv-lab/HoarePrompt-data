Output State: **`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 10, then `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, then `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5. If `x` is 0 or negative, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. `j` is increased by 1.**
