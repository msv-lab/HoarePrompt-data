According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than 0. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `j`.
State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, `j + 1`, `n`, `c`, `a` are integers**
