Example Answer:
The variable `data` is assigned the split input values. The function `func` is defined but not called, so it does not affect the state. The output state is `data` contains the split input values, and the function `func` is defined but not executed.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, and the function `func` is defined but not executed**
