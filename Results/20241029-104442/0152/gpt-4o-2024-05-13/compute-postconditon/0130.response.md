Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the integer value of the 5th element of `data`. Since `data` contains split input values, and `data[4]` represents the 5th element of `data`, `s` is assigned that integer value. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer, `k` is an integer assigned the value of the 3rd element of `data`, `x` is an integer, `s` is an integer value of the 5th element of `data`.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer, `k` is an integer assigned the value of the 3rd element of `data`, `x` is an integer, `s` is an integer value of the 5th element of `data`**
