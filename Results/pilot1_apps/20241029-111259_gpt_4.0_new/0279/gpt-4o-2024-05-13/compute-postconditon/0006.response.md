The value of `speeds[i]` is updated to the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. Given that `i` is 1, `speeds[i - 1]` is `speeds[0]`, which is `v1`. Thus, `speeds[i]` becomes `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list where `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v2`, and `speeds[1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `i` is 1**
