`speeds[-1]` is assigned the value `v2`. The list `speeds` initially has `t` zeros with `speeds[0]` set to `v1`. Setting `speeds[-1]` to `v2` means the last element of the list `speeds` is now `v2`. The rest of the elements in `speeds` remain unchanged unless they were specifically set before this snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements where `speeds[0]` is `v1` and `speeds[-1]` is `v2`. 

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are input integers, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements where `speeds[0]` is `v1` and `speeds[-1]` is `v2`**
