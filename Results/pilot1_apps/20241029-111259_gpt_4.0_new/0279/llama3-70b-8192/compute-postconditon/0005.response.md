`min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed` multiplied by `t`. The initial state provides that `t` is an input integer and `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, both input integers. Therefore, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed` multiplied by `t`; `min_length` is `min_speed` multiplied by `t`.

Output State: **`t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed` multiplied by `t`; `min_length` is `min_speed` multiplied by `t`.**
