The `StopIteration` exception could occur when calling `i = next(iter_i)` if `iter_i` has no more elements to yield. If the exception occurs, the program will execute the `except` block, which contains a `break` statement, causing the program to exit the loop or conditional block that contains the `try` statement.

If no exception occurs:
- `i` is successfully assigned the next value in `iter_i`.
- `max_speed` is updated to be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.
- `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.
- `max_length` is incremented by the updated `max_speed`.
- `min_length` is incremented by the updated `min_speed`.

The program state after the complete execution of the `try` statement is:
- If `next(iter_i)` raises a `StopIteration`, the loop or surrounding block is exited.
- Otherwise, `i` is the next value in `iter_i`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`.

Output State: **If `next(iter_i)` raises a `StopIteration`, the loop or surrounding block is exited. Otherwise, `i` is the next value in `iter_i`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`.**
