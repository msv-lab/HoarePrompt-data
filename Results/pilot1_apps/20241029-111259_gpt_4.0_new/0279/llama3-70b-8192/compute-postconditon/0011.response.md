`min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is now the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `max_length` is `max_speed` multiplied by (`t` + 1); `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`; `iter_i` is an iterator over the range from `t - 1` to `1`; `i` is the next value in `iter_i`.
