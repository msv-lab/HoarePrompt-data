`max_speed` is assigned the value of `max(v1, v2)`, which means it takes the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`. Since `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100, `max_speed` will be the greater of the two values. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`**
