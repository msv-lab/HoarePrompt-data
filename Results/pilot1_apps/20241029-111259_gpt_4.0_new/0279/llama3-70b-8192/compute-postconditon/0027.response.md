The value of `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`. The previous state of `min_length` is unknown, so we reflect the change as `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`. The states of other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`.

Output State: **`max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`.**
