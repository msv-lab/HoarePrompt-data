The `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at the point where `i = next(iter_i)` is called if there are no more items in the iterator `iter_i`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop or surrounding block is exited using a `break` statement. If no exception occurs, the program proceeds with updating `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `min_length` based on the calculations provided.

Therefore, the output state is: If `next(iter_i)` does not raise a `StopIteration`, `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop or surrounding block is exited.

Output State: **If `next(iter_i)` does not raise a `StopIteration`, `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`.
