`min_speed` is assigned the value `min(v1, v2)`, which means `min_speed` will hold the smaller of the two values, `v1` and `v2`. The values of `t`, `d`, `v1`, `v2`, and `max_speed` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`**
