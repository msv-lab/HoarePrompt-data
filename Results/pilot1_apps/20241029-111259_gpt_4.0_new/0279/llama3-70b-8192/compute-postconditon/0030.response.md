According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to run indefinitely unless there is a break condition or an exception like `StopIteration` that exits the loop. In this scenario, the loop can certainly execute one more time without any additional conditions needing to be met or state adjustments. Therefore, we simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **If `next(iter_i)` does not raise a `StopIteration`, `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop or surrounding block is exited.**
