Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, the loop is designed to execute indefinitely unless an explicit break condition or an exception like `StopIteration` occurs. Given the current state you provided, no modifications are needed to ensure the loop can execute one more time as it is inherently structured to continue executing.

State: **If `next(iter_i)` raises a `StopIteration`, the loop or surrounding block is exited. Otherwise, `i` is the next value in `iter_i`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`.**
