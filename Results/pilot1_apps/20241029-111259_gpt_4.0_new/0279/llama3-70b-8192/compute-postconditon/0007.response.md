Output State: **`t` and `d` are input integers; `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed` multiplied by `t`; `min_length` is `min_speed` multiplied by `t`; `iter_i` is an iterator over the range from `t - 1` to `1`; `i` is the next value in `iter_i`**.
