A `StopIteration` exception might be raised when calling `next(iter_i)`. If this exception occurs, the loop or surrounding block is exited due to the `break` statement in the `except` block. If the exception does not occur, the variable `i` is assigned the next value from `iter_i`. Then, `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, and `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. Following this, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. Therefore, the output state is: If `next(iter_i)` raises a `StopIteration`, the loop or surrounding block is exited via `break`. Otherwise, `i` is assigned the next value from `iter_i`, `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`.

Output State: **If `next(iter_i)` raises a `StopIteration`, the loop or surrounding block is exited. Otherwise, `i` is the next value in `iter_i`, `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, and `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`.**
