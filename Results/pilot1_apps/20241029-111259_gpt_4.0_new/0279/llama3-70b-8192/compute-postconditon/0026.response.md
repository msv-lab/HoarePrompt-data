The value of `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`. The initial state only describes the conditions for updating `max_speed` and `min_speed`, but does not provide specific values for `max_length`, `max_speed`, or `min_speed`. Therefore, the output state is: `max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. 

Output State: **`max_length` is increased by `max_speed`; `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.**
