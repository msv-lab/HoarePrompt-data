`total_volume` is assigned the value of `sum(volumes)`, which represents the sum of all the integers in the list `volumes`. The states of `n` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers; `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`. 

Output State: **`n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers; `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`.**
