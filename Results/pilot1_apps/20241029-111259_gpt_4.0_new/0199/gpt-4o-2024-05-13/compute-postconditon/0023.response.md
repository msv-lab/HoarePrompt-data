According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Specifically, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1. This means that for the loop to execute again, the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration must be less than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than 0 after being increased by 1. This implies that `i` before being increased must have been less than -1.

State: **variable `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than 0; `a` and `b` are integers with `a` updated to `a - b` if `a` > `b`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b - a`**
