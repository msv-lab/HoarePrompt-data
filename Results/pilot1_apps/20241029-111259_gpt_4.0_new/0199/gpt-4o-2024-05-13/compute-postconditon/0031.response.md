According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 0. 

To ensure that `i` is less than 0, we need to adjust the value of `i` so that it still satisfies the condition `i < 0` after being incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` must have been less than -1 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`temperature` and `threshold` are floats; if `temperature` is greater than `threshold`, then `alert` is set to `True`; otherwise, `alert` is set to `False`; variable `i` is less than -1**
