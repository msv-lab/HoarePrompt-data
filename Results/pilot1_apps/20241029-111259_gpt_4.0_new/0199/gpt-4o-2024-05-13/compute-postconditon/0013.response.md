Postcondition: **`n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers with `total_volume` being the sum of the integers in `volumes`, and `min_keg_volume` is the smallest integer in `volumes`. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, the loop is terminated immediately. Otherwise, the loop continues, potentially adjusting the state by decreasing `remaining_kvass` and updating `i` accordingly, depending on the value of each element in `volumes` relative to `min_keg_volume`.**
