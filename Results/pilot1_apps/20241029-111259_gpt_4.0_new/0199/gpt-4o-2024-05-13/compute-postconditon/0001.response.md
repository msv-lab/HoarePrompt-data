`volumes` is reassigned a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` over the input split into separate components. The values are input integers, replacing the initial list of `n` integers. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a list of input integers. 

Output State: **`n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a list of input integers.**
