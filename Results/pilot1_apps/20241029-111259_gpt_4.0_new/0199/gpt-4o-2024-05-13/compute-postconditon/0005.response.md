`min_keg_volume` is assigned the value of the first element in the `volumes` list, which is the smallest integer since `volumes` is sorted. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers; `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`; `min_keg_volume` is the smallest integer in `volumes`.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers; `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`; `min_keg_volume` is the smallest integer in `volumes`**
