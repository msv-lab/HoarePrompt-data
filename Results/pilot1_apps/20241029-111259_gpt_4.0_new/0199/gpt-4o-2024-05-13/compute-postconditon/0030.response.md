The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The states of `temperature`, `threshold`, and `alert` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `temperature` and `threshold` are floats; if `temperature` is greater than `threshold`, then `alert` is set to `True`; otherwise, `alert` is set to `False`; variable `i` is increased by 1.
