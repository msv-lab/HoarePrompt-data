Postcondition: **`n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers. `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers, with `total_volume` being the sum of the integers in `volumes`. `min_keg_volume` is the smallest integer in `volumes`. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the state remains unchanged with `remaining_kvass` equal to `s` and `i` equal to `n`. If `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass` is decreased by the value of `possible_to_take`, which is the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `i` remains equal to `n`.**
