According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have been less than -1 originally, so that even after being increased by 1, it remains less than 0.

State: **variable `i` was initially less than -1 and is increased by 1**
