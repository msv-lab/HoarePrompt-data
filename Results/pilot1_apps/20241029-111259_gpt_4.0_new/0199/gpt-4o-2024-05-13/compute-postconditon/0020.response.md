Output State: **variable `i` was initially less than -1 and is increased by 1. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the execution moves to the next iteration of the most internal loop without further changes. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
