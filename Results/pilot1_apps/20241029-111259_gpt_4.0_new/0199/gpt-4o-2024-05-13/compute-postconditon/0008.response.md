The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It is typically used to skip the current iteration of a loop. However, since no loop context is provided, the state of the variables does not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are reassigned two input integers; `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers; `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes`; `min_keg_volume` is the smallest integer in `volumes`; `remaining_kvass` is equal to `s`; `i` is equal to `n`**
