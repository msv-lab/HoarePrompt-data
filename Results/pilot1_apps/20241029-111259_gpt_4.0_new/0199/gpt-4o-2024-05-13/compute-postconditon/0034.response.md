Postcondition: **If `i` is initially 0 or positive, `remaining_kvass` remains equal to `s`, and `i` is unchanged. If `i` is initially negative, the loop executes, `i` increases until it is at least 0 or `remaining_kvass` becomes 0. After the loop, `remaining_kvass` reflects the amount of kvass still needed, which is 0 if all needed kvass was distributed. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by the quotient of `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`.**
