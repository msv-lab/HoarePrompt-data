Postcondition: **If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is set to `mid` and `high` remains greater than `low`. If `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `high` is set to `mid - 1`. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`. Initially, `low` is less than `high`.**
