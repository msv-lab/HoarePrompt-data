`v` is assigned the result of converting the input string of integers into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The function `input().split()` takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each substring to an integer. This directly affects the variable `v`. The initial constraints on the list `v` remain the same: it is a list of `n` integers where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9. The state of variables `n` and `s` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `s` are input integers, and `v` is a list of `n` integers where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, and `v` is an input list of integers. 

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, and `v` is a list of `n` integers where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, and `v` is an input list of integers.**
