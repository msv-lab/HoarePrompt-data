Postcondition: **After the loop, `low` will be the greatest possible value such that the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than `s`. If `n` is 0, `low` remains 0, and `high` remains the minimum element in `v`. If `s` is larger than any possible sum of elements in `v`, `low` will approach the minimum element in `v`. If `s` is very small or negative, `high` may be reduced to a value close to or less than 0. If the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` does not equal `s`, the code prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of `low`.**
