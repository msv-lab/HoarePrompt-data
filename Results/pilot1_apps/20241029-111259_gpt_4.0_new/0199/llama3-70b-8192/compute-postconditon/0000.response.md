`n` and `s` are reassigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, where `input` accepts an input string, `split()` divides the string by spaces into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string into an integer. The initial constraints on `n` and `s` are replaced by the new values from input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are input integers, and `v` is a list of n integers where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9. 

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, and `v` is a list of n integers where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9.**
