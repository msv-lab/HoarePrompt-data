`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The initial values of `low` and `high` are 0 and the minimum element in `v`, respectively. Therefore, `mid` is calculated as `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2`. The states of `n`, `s`, `v`, `low`, and `high` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is an input list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum element in `v`, `mid` is `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2`.
