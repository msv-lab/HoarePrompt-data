Postcondition: **`low` is less than `high`; `mid` is calculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`; `total` is the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, `low` is set to `mid` and `high` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `low` remains unchanged.**
