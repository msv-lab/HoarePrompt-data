Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is an input list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum element in `v`, `mid` is `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2`, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `mid` and each element `x` in `v`**.
