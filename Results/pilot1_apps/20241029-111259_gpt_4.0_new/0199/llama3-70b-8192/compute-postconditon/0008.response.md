Postcondition: **Given `n` and `s` as input integers, and `v` as an input list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with each element `v_i` satisfying 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is initially 0 and `high` is the minimum element in `v`. `mid` is calculated as `(0 + minimum element in v + 1) // 2`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum of `mid` and each element `x` in `v`. If `total` is less than `s`, `low` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. This logic ensures that `low` and `high` are adjusted to find an optimal value for `mid` such that the sum of the adjusted elements closely approaches `s`.**
