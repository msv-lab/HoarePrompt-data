To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `low < high` is satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, we have two possible adjustments based on the value of `total` relative to `s`.

1. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is set to `mid` and `high` remains greater than `low`. The condition `low < high` must still hold after these assignments, so we need to ensure that `mid < high`.

2. If `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `high` is set to `mid - 1`. For the loop to execute again, the condition `low < high` must still hold, so we need to ensure that `low < mid - 1`.

Since initially `low` is less than `high`, these adjustments ensure the condition for the loop to continue is met.

State: **If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is set to `mid` and `mid` is less than `high`. If `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `high` is set to `mid - 1` and `low` is less than `mid - 1`.**
