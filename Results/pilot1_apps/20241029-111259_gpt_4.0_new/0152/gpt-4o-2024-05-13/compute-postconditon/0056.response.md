`time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * a[i]`. The previous values are `remaining_potions`, which is either `0` or `n - c[j]`, whichever is greater, and `a[i]` is a specific value. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `k` is less than -1, `j` is `k + 2`, `remaining_potions` is either `0` or `n - c[j]`, whichever is greater, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`. 

Output State: **`remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `k` is less than -1, `j` is `k + 2`, `remaining_potions` is either `0` or `n - c[j]`, whichever is greater, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`**.
