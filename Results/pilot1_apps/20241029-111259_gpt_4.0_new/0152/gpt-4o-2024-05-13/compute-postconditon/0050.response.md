`min_time` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `k` is less than -1, `j` is `k + 1`, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`, `min_time` is the minimum of its current value and `time_with_both_spells`.
