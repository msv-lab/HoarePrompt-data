According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 2`, and `k` is less than -1. Therefore, `j` is less than 1, which means it is certainly less than 0. Thus, the loop can execute one more time without any need for adjustment to the state.

State: **`remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `k` is less than -1, `j` is `k + 2`**
