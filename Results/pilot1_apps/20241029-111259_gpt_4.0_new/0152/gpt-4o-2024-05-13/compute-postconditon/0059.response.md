Postcondition: **`remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `k` is less than -1, `j` is `k + 2`. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of `0` and `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
