`remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`. The values of `remaining_manapoints` and `j` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_manapoints` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`; `j` is assigned the value of `k`; `remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`.

Output State: **`remaining_manapoints` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`; `j` is assigned the value of `k`; `remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`**.
