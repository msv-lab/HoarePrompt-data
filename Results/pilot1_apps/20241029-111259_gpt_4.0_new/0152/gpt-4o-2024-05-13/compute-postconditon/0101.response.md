According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 1`. For `j` to be less than 0, `k + 1` must be less than 0, which means `k` must be less than -1. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop condition.

State: **`i` is less than 0; `remaining_manapoints` is `s` minus `b[i]` where `i` is a negative index; `j` is `k + 1` and `k` is less than -1**
