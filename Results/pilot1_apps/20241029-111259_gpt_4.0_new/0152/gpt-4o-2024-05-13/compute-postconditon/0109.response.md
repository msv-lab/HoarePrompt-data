`remaining_potions` is assigned the value of `max(0, n - c[j])`. Given that `j` is `k + 2` and `k` is less than -1, `j` is less than 1. The value of `remaining_potions` depends on the values of `n` and `c[j]`, which are not provided. Therefore, `remaining_potions` can be at least 0. The output state is: `i` is less than 0; `remaining_manapoints` is `s` minus `b[i]` where `i` is a negative index; `j` is `k + 2` and `k` is less than -1; `remaining_potions` is at least 0.
