The variable `k` is assigned the integer value of the third element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[2])`. The states of the other variables `n` and `m` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[0])`; `m` is assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[1])`; `k` is assigned the integer value of the third element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[2])`. 

Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[0])`; `m` is assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[1])`; `k` is assigned the integer value of the third element in the `data` list, which is `int(data[2])`**.
