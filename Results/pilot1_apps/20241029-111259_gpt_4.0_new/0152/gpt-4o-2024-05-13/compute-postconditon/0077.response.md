Output State: **If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `min_time` is updated to `min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)`; all other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state. If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the state is unchanged.**
