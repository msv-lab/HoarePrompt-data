According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` is not explicitly provided, but we know that `i` was less than 0 since the loop executed. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` should still be less than 0.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration has `i` increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than 0 for the loop to proceed. No other states need to be adjusted because the condition depends solely on `i`.

State: **`i` is less than 0**
