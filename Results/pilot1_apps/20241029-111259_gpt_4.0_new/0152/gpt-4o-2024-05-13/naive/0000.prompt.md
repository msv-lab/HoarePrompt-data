You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with a function description and a Python function code snippet. You need to provide if the code does what the function description says. Please avoid describing how the program runs. If the code satisfies the description reply CORRECT, otherwise reply INCORRECT with an explanation. You must adhere to the text format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.

Description: Anton is playing a very interesting computer game, but now he is stuck at one of the levels. To pass to the next level he has to prepare n potions.

Anton has a special kettle, that can prepare one potions in x seconds. Also, he knows spells of two types that can faster the process of preparing potions.  Spells of this type speed up the preparation time of one potion. There are m spells of this type, the i-th of them costs b_{i} manapoints and changes the preparation time of each potion to a_{i} instead of x.  Spells of this type immediately prepare some number of potions. There are k such spells, the i-th of them costs d_{i} manapoints and instantly create c_{i} potions. 

Anton can use no more than one spell of the first type and no more than one spell of the second type, and the total number of manapoints spent should not exceed s. Consider that all spells are used instantly and right before Anton starts to prepare potions.

Anton wants to get to the next level as fast as possible, so he is interested in the minimum number of time he needs to spent in order to prepare at least n potions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of potions, Anton has to make, the number of spells of the first type and the number of spells of the second type.

The second line of the input contains two integers x and s (2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9) — the initial number of seconds required to prepare one potion and the number of manapoints Anton can use.

The third line contains m integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < x) — the number of seconds it will take to prepare one potion if the i-th spell of the first type is used.

The fourth line contains m integers b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints to use the i-th spell of the first type.

There are k integers c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) in the fifth line — the number of potions that will be immediately created if the i-th spell of the second type is used. It's guaranteed that c_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. c_{i} ≤ c_{j} if i < j.

The sixth line contains k integers d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints required to use the i-th spell of the second type. It's guaranteed that d_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. d_{i} ≤ d_{j} if i < j.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum time one has to spent in order to prepare n potions.


-----Examples-----

10 99
2 4 3
20 10 40
4 15
10 80

Output
20

Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
200 100 400
4 15
100 800

Output
200



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the optimum answer is to use the second spell of the first type that costs 10 manapoints. Thus, the preparation time of each potion changes to 4 seconds. Also, Anton should use the second spell of the second type to instantly prepare 15 potions spending 80 manapoints. The total number of manapoints used is 10 + 80 = 90, and the preparation time is 4·5 = 20 seconds (15 potions were prepared instantly, and the remaining 5 will take 4 seconds each).

In the second sample, Anton can't use any of the spells, so he just prepares 20 potions, spending 10 seconds on each of them and the answer is 20·10 = 200.
Python Fucntion:
```
def min_time_to_prepare_potions(n, m, k, x, s, a, b, c, d):
    min_time = n * x

    # Try using only the second type of spell
    for i in range(k):
        if d[i] <= s:
            remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[i])
            time_with_spell = remaining_potions * x
            min_time = min(min_time, time_with_spell)
    
    # Try using only the first type of spell
    for i in range(m):
        if b[i] <= s:
            time_with_spell = n * a[i]
            min_time = min(min_time, time_with_spell)

    # Try using both types of spells
    for i in range(m):
        if b[i] <= s:
            remaining_manapoints = s - b[i]
            for j in range(k):
                if d[j] <= remaining_manapoints:
                    remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[j])
                    time_with_both_spells = remaining_potions * a[i]
                    min_time = min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)
                else:
                    break

    return min_time

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    k = int(data[2])
    x = int(data[3])
    s = int(data[4])
    
    a = list(map(int, data[5:5+m]))
    b = list(map(int, data[5+m:5+2*m]))
    c = list(map(int, data[5+2*m:5+2*m+k]))
    d = list(map(int, data[5+2*m+k:5+2*m+2*k]))

    result = min_time_to_prepare_potions(n, m, k, x, s, a, b, c, d)
    print(result)

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Use the format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.
