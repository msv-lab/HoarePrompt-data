n, m, and k are integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9 and 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5. x and s are integers with 2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9. a and b are lists of m integers where 1 ≤ a[i] < x and 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 2·10^9 for each i. c and d are lists of k integers where 1 ≤ c[i] ≤ n and 1 ≤ d[i] ≤ 2·10^9 for each i, and c and d are non-decreasing.
