The value of `cnt` is assigned to `c[j]`. The initial state does not provide the value of `c[j]`, so we can't determine the specific value of `cnt`. If the loop executes, `j` will be decremented by 1 after it finishes executing. If the loop does not execute, `j` will be -1. `s_left` will be decreased by the sum of `d[0]` to `d[j-1]` if the loop executes, otherwise `s_left` will remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`; if the loop executes, `j` is decremented by 1; if the loop does not execute, `j` is -1; `s_left` will be decreased by the sum of `d[0]` to `d[j-1]` if the loop executes, otherwise `s_left` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`; if the loop executes, `j` is decremented by 1; if the loop does not execute, `j` is -1; `s_left` will be decreased by the sum of `d[0]` to `d[j-1]` if the loop executes, otherwise `s_left` will remain unchanged.**
