`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j] - d[j]`; `j` is 2; `k` is greater than 1; `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]` minus `d[j]`.

Output State: **`s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j] - d[j]`; `j` is 2; `k` is greater than 1; `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]` minus `d[j]`**
