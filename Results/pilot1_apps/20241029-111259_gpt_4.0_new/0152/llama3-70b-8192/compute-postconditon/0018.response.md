The value of `s_left` is decreased by `d[j]`. Since `s_left` was initially decreased by `d[0]`, it is now decreased further by `d[j]`. The state of `j` is increased by 1, and the conditions `j + 1 < k` and `s_left - d[0] >= d[j + 1]` still hold. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is increased by 1, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0] + d[j]`, `j + 1 < k`, `s_left - d[0] >= d[j + 1]`. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0] + d[j]`, `j + 1 < k`, `s_left - d[0] >= d[j + 1]`**
