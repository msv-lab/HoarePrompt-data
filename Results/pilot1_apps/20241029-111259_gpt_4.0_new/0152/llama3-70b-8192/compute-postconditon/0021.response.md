`s_left` is decreased by `d[j]`. Initially, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0] + d[j]`, and now it is further decreased by `d[j]`. Therefore, the new value of `s_left` is decreased by `d[0] + 2*d[j]`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is increased by 2, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0] + 2*d[j]`, `j < k`, `s_left - d[0] >= d[j]`**
