According to the code, the loop will execute based on the condition `i < 0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Since the loop condition is `i < 0`, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be adjusted to ensure it remains less than 0. Therefore, `i` should be less than or equal to -1. No other states affect the loop condition, so no other adjustments are necessary.

State: **`cnt` is initialized to 0; if `j` is not equal to -1, `cnt` is set to `c[j]`. If the loop executed at least once, `j` is decremented by 1, and if `k` is 0 or `s_left` was initially less than `d[0]`, `j` remains -1. `s_left` remains unchanged from its value after the loop execution or stays as `s - b[i]` if the loop did not execute. `ans` is set to the minimum of its current value and `(n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t`. `i` is less than or equal to -1.**
