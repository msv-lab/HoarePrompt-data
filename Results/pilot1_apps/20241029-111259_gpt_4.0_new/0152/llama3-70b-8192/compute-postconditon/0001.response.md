Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and 1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ 2·10^5; `a` and `b` are lists of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `a[i]` < `x` and 1 ≤ `b[i]` ≤ 2·10^9 for each `i`; `c` and `d` are lists of `k` integers where 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `d[i]` ≤ 2·10^9 for each `i`, and `c` and `d` are non-decreasing; `x` and `s` are input integers.**
