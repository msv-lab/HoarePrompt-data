The variable `s_left` is decreased by the value of `d[j]`, where `j` is 0. The specific value of `d[0]` is not given, so we cannot determine the exact change in `s_left`. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is assigned the value 0, and `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`; all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is assigned the value 0, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`; all other variables remain unchanged.**
