According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than 0 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is indeed less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **If `j` is not -1, `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`. If the loop executes, `j` is decremented by 1, and `s_left` is decreased by the sum of `d[0]` to `d[j-1]`. If the loop does not execute, `j` is -1 and `s_left` remains unchanged. `ans` is updated to `min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)`; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is less than 0**
