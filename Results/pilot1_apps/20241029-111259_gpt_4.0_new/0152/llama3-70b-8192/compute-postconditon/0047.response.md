According to the code, for the loop to execute again, both conditions `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]` must be true.

1. **Condition `j < k`:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `k` is greater than 2. This implies that `j` is already less than `k`, so no change is needed for this condition.

2. **Condition `s_left >= d[j]`:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`, `d[1]`, and `d[2]`. For the loop to execute again, `s_left` must be at least `d[3]` because `j` is currently 3 and the next condition to check is `s_left >= d[3]`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `s_left` is at least `d[3]` for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`j` is 3, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`, `s_left` is decreased by `d[1]`, `k` is greater than 2, `s_left` is decreased by `d[2]`, and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[3]`**
