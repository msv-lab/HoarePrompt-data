The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since `j` was initially assigned the value 1, after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`, `k` is greater than 1, `s_left` is decreased by `d[1]`, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `s_left` is decreased by `d[0]`, `k` is greater than 1, `s_left` is decreased by `d[1]`, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[1]`**
