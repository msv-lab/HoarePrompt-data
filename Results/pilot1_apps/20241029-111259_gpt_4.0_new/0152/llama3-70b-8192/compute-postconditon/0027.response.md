If the loop does not execute, `j` remains -1 and `s_left` is unchanged. `cnt` is assigned the value `c[j]`, which means `cnt` is assigned the value `c[-1]`. If the loop executes, `j` is decremented by 1 after the loop, so `cnt` is assigned the value `c[j]`, where `j` is the smallest index where `j < k` and `s_left < d[j]` or `j` is equal to `k`, and `j` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `cnt` is assigned `c[j]` where `j` fits the description, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **If loop doesn't execute: `j` is -1, `s_left` is unchanged, `cnt` is `c[-1]`. If loop executes: `s_left` is decreased by the sum of `d[0]` through `d[j-1]`, `j` is decremented by 1, `cnt` is `c[j]`.**
