Output State: **If `s_left < d[0]` initially, the loop does not execute, `j` remains -1, and `s_left` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is the smallest index where `j < k` and `s_left < d[j]`, and `s_left` is decreased by the sum of `d[0]` through `d[j-1]`. After the loop, `j` is either equal to `k` or `s_left < d[j]`, and `j` is decremented by 1; `cnt` is 0.**
