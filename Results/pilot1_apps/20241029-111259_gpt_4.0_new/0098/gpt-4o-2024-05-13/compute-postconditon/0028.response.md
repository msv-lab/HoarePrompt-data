`a3` is assigned the integer value of `data[4]`, and `b3` is assigned the integer value of `data[5]`. The initial state variables `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`, `b1` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `a2` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`, `b2` is assigned the integer value of `data[3]`, `a3` is assigned the integer value of `data[4]`, `b3` is assigned the integer value of `data[5]`.

Output State: **`a1` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`, `b1` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `a2` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`, `b2` is assigned the integer value of `data[3]`, `a3` is assigned the integer value of `data[4]`, `b3` is assigned the integer value of `data[5]`**
