Output State: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` <= 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each; `iterator` is now pointing to the second element of `possible_orientations`; `w2` is `a2`, `h2` is `b2`, `w3` is `a3`, `h3` is `b3`, and the function returns 'YES'**.
