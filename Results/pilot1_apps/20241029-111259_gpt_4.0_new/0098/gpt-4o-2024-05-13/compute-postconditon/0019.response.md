In this case, the `while` loop condition is `while True`, meaning the loop is designed to run indefinitely without any explicit condition to stop it. Therefore, there is no need to modify any of the program state variables to ensure that the loop will execute again. The loop will continue to run regardless of any changes to the state.

State: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` <= 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each, specifically: [(a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), (b2, a2, b3, a3)]; `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`.**
