Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` <= 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each, specifically: [(a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), (b2, a2, b3, a3)]; `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`; `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned the first tuple in `possible_orientations`, which is (`a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`). If either the sum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the maximum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, or the maximum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the sum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, then the function returns 'YES'.**
