`w2`, `h2`, `w3`, and `h3` are assigned the next tuple from the `iterator` over `possible_orientations`. The first tuple in `possible_orientations` is `(a2, b2, a3, b3)`, so `w2` is assigned `a2`, `h2` is assigned `b2`, `w3` is assigned `a3`, and `h3` is assigned `b3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` <= 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each; `iterator` is now pointing to the second element of `possible_orientations`; `w2` is `a2`, `h2` is `b2`, `w3` is `a3`, `h3` is `b3`.

Output State: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` <= 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each; `iterator` is now pointing to the second element of `possible_orientations`; `w2` is `a2`, `h2` is `b2`, `w3` is `a3`, `h3` is `b3`.**
