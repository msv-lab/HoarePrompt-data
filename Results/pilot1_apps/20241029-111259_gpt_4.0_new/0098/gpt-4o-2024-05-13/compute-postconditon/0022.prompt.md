You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, and b3 are integers such that 1 <= a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 <= 1000.
```
def func(a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3):
```
Output: Case_1: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` <= 1000. `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each, specifically: [(a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), (b2, a2, b3, a3)]. `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`. The function returns 'YES' if a valid tuple is obtained and the conditions are met; otherwise, it breaks if a `StopIteration` is encountered.

Case_2: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` <= 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each; `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`. If the next tuple can be successfully unpacked and one of the conditions is met, the function returns 'YES'. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the loop or conditional is exited, and the state becomes unknown.

Case_3: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers within a specified range; `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each; `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`. If a tuple is successfully yielded, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned values from the tuple. If any specified condition is satisfied, the function returns 'YES'. If there are no more elements to yield, the program breaks out of the loop or control structure.

Case_4: If a suitable configuration is found among `possible_orientations`, the function returns 'YES'. If `possible_orientations` is empty or no configuration meets the conditions, the loop completes without returning 'YES', potentially requiring additional handling to return 'NO'. All input variables (`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`) remain unchanged, `possible_orientations` is exhausted, and the iterator is at the end of the list.

Case_5: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` <= 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list of tuples containing four integer elements each, specifically: [(a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), (b2, a2, b3, a3)]; `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`, and the function returns 'NO'.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
