Correctness: **False**

The program only checks if each painting can fit on the board individually, but it does not check whether both paintings can fit on the board simultaneously without overlapping. It lacks logic to check if the combined area of the two paintings, considering their possible rotations, can fit within the board's area. For example, for inputs:

```
a1, b1 = 4, 4
a2, b2 = 3, 2
a3, b3 = 2, 3
```

The program would output "YES", assuming each painting can independently fit on the board, but in reality, they cannot both fit without overlapping. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine if both paintings can be placed on the board as described in the problem statement.
