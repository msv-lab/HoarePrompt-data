RESULT: **Incorrect**. 

Explanation: The code only checks if each painting individually fits within the dimensions of the board, but it does not check if both paintings can fit together on the board without overlapping. The logic needs to account for arranging both paintings on the board simultaneously, considering different orientations and positions to ensure they can both fit without exceeding the board dimensions.
