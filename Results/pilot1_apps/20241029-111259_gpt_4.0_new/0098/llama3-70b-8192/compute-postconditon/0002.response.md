`a3` and `b3` are assigned the values from the input, which are split into two integers. The previous values of `a3` and `b3` are replaced by these new input integers. The states of `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are newly input integers, `a3` and `b3` are newly input integers. 

Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are newly input integers, `a3` and `b3` are newly input integers**
