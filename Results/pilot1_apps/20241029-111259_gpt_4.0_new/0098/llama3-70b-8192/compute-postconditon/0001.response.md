`a2` and `b2` are assigned the values from the input, using `map(int, input().split())`, which means they will be integers provided by the user. The values of `a1`, `b1`, `a3`, and `b3` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are newly input integers, `a3` and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= a3, b3 <= 1000.

Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are newly input integers, `a3` and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= a3, b3 <= 1000**.
