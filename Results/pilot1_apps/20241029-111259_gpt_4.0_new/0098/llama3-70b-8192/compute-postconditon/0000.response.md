The values of `a1` and `b1` are reassigned using `map(int, input().split())`, which means they are set to integers obtained from input, where the input consists of two space-separated integers. As a result, the specific values of `a1` and `b1` are determined by the input. The other variables, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= a2, b2, a3, b3 <= 1000.

Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers such that 1 <= a2, b2, a3, b3 <= 1000**
