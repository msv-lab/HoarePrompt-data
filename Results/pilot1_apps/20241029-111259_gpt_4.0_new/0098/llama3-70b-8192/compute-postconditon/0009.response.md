Postcondition for if body: If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a2` and `b2`, then the nested condition is checked. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is also greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then `'YES'` is printed. Otherwise, `'NO'` is printed.
Postcondition for else body: If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then `'YES'` is printed. Otherwise, `'NO'` is printed.
Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a2` and `b2`, the program checks further against `a3` and `b3`: if the maximum and minimum conditions also hold true against `a3` and `b3`, `'YES'` is printed; otherwise, `'NO'` is printed. If the initial condition against `a2` and `b2` does not hold, the program checks directly against `a3` and `b3`: if the conditions hold, `'YES'` is printed; otherwise, `'NO'` is printed. This logic ensures that if both `a2, b2` and `a3, b3` are lesser or equal in both max and min comparisons to `a1, b1`, the output is `'YES'`, otherwise `'NO'` is printed.**
