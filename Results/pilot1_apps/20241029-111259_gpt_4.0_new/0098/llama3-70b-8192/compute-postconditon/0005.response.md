Postcondition: **`a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are newly input integers, `a3` and `b3` are newly input integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then `'YES'` is printed. Otherwise, `'NO'` is printed.**
