`shares` is assigned the value 0. The initial state indicates that `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `r` remain unchanged except for `r`, which is increased by `shares * b[i]`. However, since `shares` is now 0, the increase in `r` is 0, so `r` remains unchanged. The condition `i` is less than -1 doesn't affect the assignment to `shares`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `r` remain unchanged; `shares` is 0.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `r` remain unchanged; `shares` is 0**
