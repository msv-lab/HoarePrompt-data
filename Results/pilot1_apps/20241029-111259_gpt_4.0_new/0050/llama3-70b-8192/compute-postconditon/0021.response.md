The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1 and is less than 0; `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
