The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is less than 0, so now `i` is still less than or equal to 0. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r` remain unchanged; `i` is less than or equal to 0. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r` remain unchanged; `i` is less than or equal to 0.**
