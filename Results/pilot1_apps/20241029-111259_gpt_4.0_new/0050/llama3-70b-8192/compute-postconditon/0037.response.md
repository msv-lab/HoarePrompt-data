`i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r` remain unchanged; `i` is less than or equal to 0 (since `i` was initially less than -1, and it is increased by 1). 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r` remain unchanged; `i` is less than or equal to 0.**
