Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of integers from input sorted in descending order; `shares` is incremented by `r // s[i]`; `i` is an integer from input where 1 ≤ i ≤ 30; `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`**.
