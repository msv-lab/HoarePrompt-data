The list `b` is sorted in descending order using the `sort(reverse=True)` method. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of integers from input sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of integers from input sorted in descending order.**
