According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0 after this increment. Therefore, `i` must have been less than -1 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r` remain unchanged; `i` is less than -1**
