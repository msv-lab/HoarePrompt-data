`i` is assigned the value of `n`, which is an integer from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of integers from input sorted in descending order; `shares` is 0; `i` is an integer from input where 1 ≤ i ≤ 30.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of integers from input sorted in descending order; `shares` is 0; `i` is an integer from input where 1 ≤ i ≤ 30.**
