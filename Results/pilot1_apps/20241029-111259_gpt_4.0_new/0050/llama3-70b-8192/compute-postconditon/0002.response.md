`b` is reassigned as a list of integers obtained from the input, where each integer is mapped from a string to an integer using the `map` function and `split` separates the input string by spaces. The previous state of `b` is overwritten. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a re-assigned list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of integers from input. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, 1 ≤ m ≤ 30, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000; `s` is a re-assigned list of `n` integers each between 1 and 1000; `b` is a list of integers from input.**
