According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to 0, which means it is possible for `i` to be equal to 0, in which case the loop would not execute again. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is strictly less than 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `r` remain unchanged; `i` is less than 0**
