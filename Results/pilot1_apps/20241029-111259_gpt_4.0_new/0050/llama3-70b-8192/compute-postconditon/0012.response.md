According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than 0. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted so that it remains less than 0 after being increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **variable `i` is increased by 1 and is less than 0; `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are unchanged**
