`r` is incremented by the value of `shares * b[i]`. The initial state mentions that `i` is equal to `m`. Since `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `m`, and `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[m]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged; `i` is equal to `m`; `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[m]`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged; `i` is equal to `m`; `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[m]`**
