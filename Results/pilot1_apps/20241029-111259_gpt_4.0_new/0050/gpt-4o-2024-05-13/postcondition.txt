`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, then `r` is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price` gives `max_shares`, the remainder gives `remaining_bourles`, and the sum of `max_shares * max_sell_price` and `remaining_bourles` results in `total_bourles`, which is printed.
