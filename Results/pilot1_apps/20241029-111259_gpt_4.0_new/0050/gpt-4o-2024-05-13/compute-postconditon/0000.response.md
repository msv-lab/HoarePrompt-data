The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are reassigned based on the input values obtained from `input().split()`. The initial constraints are 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, and 1 <= r <= 1000, but since `n`, `m`, and `r` are reassigned, these constraints still apply to the new input values. Therefore, the output state is that `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input, each satisfying the given constraints, and the lists `s` and `b` are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input, each satisfying the given constraints; `s` is a list of `n` integers where each `s_i` satisfies 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 1000.**
