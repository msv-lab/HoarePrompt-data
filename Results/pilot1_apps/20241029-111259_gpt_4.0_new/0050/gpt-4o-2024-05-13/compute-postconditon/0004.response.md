The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value in the list `b`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`.
