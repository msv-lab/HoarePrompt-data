`remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, which is the remainder when `r` is divided by `min_buy_price`. The previous state of the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, and `max_shares` is unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `max_shares` is the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`.**
