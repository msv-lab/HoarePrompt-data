`b` is assigned the value of a list of integers obtained from input, where each integer is mapped to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `b` is redefined as a new list of integers from the input, replacing its previous state. The output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained from input; `s` is a list of integers obtained from new input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`.**
