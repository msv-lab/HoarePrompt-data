Given the information provided, we need to ensure that the state is such that the `while True` loop can execute one more time. Since this is a `while True` loop, it will always execute regardless of the current state. Therefore, we simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `possible_orientations` is a list containing the tuples (a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), and (b2, a2, b3, a3), `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`**
