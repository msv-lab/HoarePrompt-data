You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, and b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000.
```
def func(a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3):
```
Output: Case_1: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; `possible_orientations` is a list containing the tuples (a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), and (b2, a2, b3, a3); `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`; `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned the next tuple from `iterator`. If `w2 + w3 <= a1` and `max(h2, h3) <= b1`, or `max(w2, w3) <= a1` and `h2 + h3 <= b1`, then the function returns 'YES'. If `h2 + h3 <= b1` and `max(w2, w3) <= a1`, or `max(h2, h3) <= b1` and `w2 + w3 <= a1`, then the function returns 'YES'. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Case_2: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000. `possible_orientations` is a list containing the tuples (a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), and (b2, a2, b3, a3). `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`. `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, and `h3` are assigned the values of the first tuple from `possible_orientations`. If `w2 + w3 <= a1` and `max(h2, h3) <= b1` or `max(w2, w3) <= a1` and `h2 + h3 <= b1`, the function returns 'YES'. If `h2 + h3 <= b1` and `max(w2, w3) <= a1` or `max(h2, h3) <= b1` and `w2 + w3 <= a1`, the function returns 'YES'. If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Case_3: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000. `possible_orientations` is a list containing the tuples (a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), and (b2, a2, b3, a3). `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`. `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, and `h3` are set to the values of the next tuple in `iterator`. If `w2 + w3 <= a1` and `max(h2, h3) <= b1` or `max(w2, w3) <= a1` and `h2 + h3 <= b1`, the function returns 'YES'. If `h2 + h3 <= b1` and `max(w2, w3) <= a1` or `max(h2, h3) <= b1` and `w2 + w3 <= a1`, the function returns 'YES'. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the loop or if statement breaks.

Case_4: If any valid orientation is found where the conditions are satisfied, the loop returns 'YES' and exits. If no valid orientation is found, the loop exhausts all possible orientations in `possible_orientations`, `iterator` raises `StopIteration`, and the loop breaks. `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` remain unchanged, and `iterator` is exhausted.

Case_5: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `possible_orientations` is a list containing the tuples (a2, b2, a3, b3), (a2, b2, b3, a3), (b2, a2, a3, b3), and (b2, a2, b3, a3), `iterator` is an iterator over `possible_orientations`, and the function returns 'NO'

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
