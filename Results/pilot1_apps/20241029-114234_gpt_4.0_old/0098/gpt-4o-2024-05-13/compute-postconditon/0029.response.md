Output State: **The function accepts six integers representing the dimensions of three rectangles. It checks if any orientation of the second and third rectangles can fit within the dimensions of the first rectangle. It returns 'YES' if a valid configuration is found and 'NO' otherwise. The function assumes all input dimensions are within the range of 1 to 1000 but does not validate this; input is assigned the value sys.stdin.read, data is a list of substrings obtained by splitting input on whitespace, a1 is assigned the integer value of data[0], b1 is assigned the integer value of data[1], a2 is assigned the integer value of data[2], b2 is assigned the integer value of data[3], a3 is assigned the integer value of data[4], b3 is assigned the integer value of data[5], and the function func(a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3) returns either 'YES' or 'NO' and the result is printed.**
