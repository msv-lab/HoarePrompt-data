Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks only if each painting can fit within the board individually, but it does not check if both paintings can fit simultaneously on the board without overlapping. The problem description requires that both paintings be placed on the board at the same time, which is not accounted for by the given program. Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 4
3 2
2 3
```
Expected output: YES (since the paintings can be placed side by side on the 4x4 board)

Actual output from the program: NO

The program only checks if each painting can fit within the dimensions of the board individually, not together. Thus, it fails to consider the correct placement of both paintings on the board simultaneously without overlapping.
