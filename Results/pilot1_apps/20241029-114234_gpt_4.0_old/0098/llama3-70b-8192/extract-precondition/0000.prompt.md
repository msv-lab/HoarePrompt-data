You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sotheby's auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall. For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board. The board has shape of an a_1 × b_1 rectangle, the paintings have shape of a a_2 × b_2 and a_3 × b_3 rectangles.

Since the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art, it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated, but still, one side of both the board, and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor. The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board, but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board. Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board, or is the board he bought not large enough?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated numbers a_1 and b_1 — the sides of the board. Next two lines contain numbers a_2, b_2, a_3 and b_3 — the sides of the paintings. All numbers a_{i}, b_{i} in the input are integers and fit into the range from 1 to 1000.


-----Output-----

If the paintings can be placed on the wall, print "YES" (without the quotes), and if they cannot, print "NO" (without the quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2
1 3
2 1

Output
YES

Input
5 5
3 3
3 3

Output
NO

Input
4 2
2 3
1 2

Output
YES



-----Note-----

That's how we can place the pictures in the first test:

And that's how we can do it in the third one.

Program:
```
a1, b1 = map(int, input().split())
a2, b2 = map(int, input().split())
a3, b3 = map(int, input().split())

if max(a1, b1) >= max(a2, b2) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a2, b2):
    if max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
else:
    if max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

```
