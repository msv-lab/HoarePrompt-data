`a3` and `b3` are assigned the values from the input, split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `a3` and `b3` are overwritten by the new input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers.

Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers**
