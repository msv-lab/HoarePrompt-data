`a1` and `b1` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, where `split` divides the input into separate strings and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `a1` and `b1` are now dependent on the user's input. The other variables `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000**
