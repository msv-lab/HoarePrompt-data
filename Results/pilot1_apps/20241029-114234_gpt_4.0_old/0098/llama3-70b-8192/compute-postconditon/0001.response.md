`a2` and `b2` are assigned values from `map(int, input().split())`, where `input` accepts input, `split()` splits the input into components, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000**
