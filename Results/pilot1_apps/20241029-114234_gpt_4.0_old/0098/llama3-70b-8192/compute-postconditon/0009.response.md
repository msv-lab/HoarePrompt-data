Precondition: `a1` and `b1` are input integers, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers
Program fragment:
```
if max(a1, b1) >= max(a2, b2) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a2, b2):
    if max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif max(a1, b1) >= max(a3, b3) and min(a1, b1) >= min(a3, b3):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

```
Postcondition for if body: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, and `a3`, `b3` are input integers. If both the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a2` and `b2`, and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a2` and `b2`, then if both the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a3` and `b3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Postcondition for else body: `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are input integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3` and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.
Postcondition: **`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3` are input integers. If the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a2` and `b2` and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a2` and `b2`, then if the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a3` and `b3` and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a3` and `b3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is not greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a2` and `b2` or the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is not greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a2` and `b2`, then if the maximum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `a3` and `b3` and the minimum value of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `a3` and `b3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
