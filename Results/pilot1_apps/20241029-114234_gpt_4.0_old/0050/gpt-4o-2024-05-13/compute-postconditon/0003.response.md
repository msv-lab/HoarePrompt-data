`min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value of the list `s`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a new list of input integers; `b` is a list of input integers converted from a space-separated string; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a new list of input integers; `b` is a list of input integers converted from a space-separated string; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`**
