`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values resulting from `map(int, input().split())`. The `input` function accepts input, and `split` divides the input string into a list of substrings. `map(int, input().split())` converts these substrings into integers. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of `n` integers where each element `s_i` satisfies `1 <= s_i <= 1000`; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies `1 <= b_i <= 1000`**
