`s` is assigned the value of a list converted from input strings to integers. Each element of the input string is split by spaces and mapped to an integer, forming the new list `s`. The initial state mentions that `s` is already a list of `n` integers, so this assignment will overwrite the previous list `s` with new input values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a new list of input integers; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies `1 <= b_i <= 1000`**
