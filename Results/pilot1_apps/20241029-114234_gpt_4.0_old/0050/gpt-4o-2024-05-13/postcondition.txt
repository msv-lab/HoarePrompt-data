`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a new list of input integers; `b` is a list of input integers converted from a space-separated string; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles` is printed.
