Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly account for the optimal strategy in all possible cases. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3 11
4 2 5
6 6 6
```

The goal is to maximize the number of bourles after the evening. With an initial 11 bourles, the optimal strategy would be to buy 5 shares at the price of 2 bourles each (spending all 10 bourles and having 1 bourle left) and then sell those 5 shares at the price of 6 bourles each, resulting in 5 * 6 + 1 = 31 bourles.

However, the given code first sorts the buying prices in ascending order and the selling prices in descending order. It then buys shares at the cheapest price until it can't buy more, and then sells all shares at the highest selling price. This approach does not always yield the optimal result.

For the input provided above, the code will perform as follows:
- Buy 5 shares at the price of 2 bourles each (spending 10 bourles and having 1 bourle left).
- Then, it will sell those 5 shares at the price of 6 bourles each, yielding 30 bourles.
- Adding the remaining 1 bourle, the total is 31 bourles.

While the correct result is obtained for this specific input, the code fails to account for edge cases where the highest selling price might not be the optimal selling price, or where intermediate selling prices might yield better results.

For example:
```
3 3 11
4 2 5
5 6 7
```

In this case:
- The optimal strategy would be to buy shares at 2 bourles each and sell them at 7 bourles each.
- The code, however, will sell them all at 7 bourles each, resulting in a suboptimal outcome.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases as required by the problem description.
