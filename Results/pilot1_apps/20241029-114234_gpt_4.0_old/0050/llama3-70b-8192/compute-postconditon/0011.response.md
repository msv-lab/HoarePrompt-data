`i` is incremented by 1, and `i` is initially the value of `n`. Therefore, the new value of `i` is `n + 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`**
