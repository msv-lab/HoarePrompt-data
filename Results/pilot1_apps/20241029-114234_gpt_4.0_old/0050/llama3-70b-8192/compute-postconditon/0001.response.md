`s` is assigned the value `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input` accepts input and `split` splits it into a list of strings which are then converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. Therefore, `s` becomes a list of input integers. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers such that each 1 <= `b_i` <= 1000**
