`shares` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, and `shares` is 0.
