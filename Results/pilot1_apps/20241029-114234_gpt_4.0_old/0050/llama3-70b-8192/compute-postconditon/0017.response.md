The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The states of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is increased by 1**
