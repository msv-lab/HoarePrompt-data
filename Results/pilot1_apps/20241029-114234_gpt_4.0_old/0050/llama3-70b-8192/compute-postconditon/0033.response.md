`r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]` to its current value. Given that `shares` is 0, the product `shares * b[i]` will be 0, so `r` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is the value of `m` + 1**
