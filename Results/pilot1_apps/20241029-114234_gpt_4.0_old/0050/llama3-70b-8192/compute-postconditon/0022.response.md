Precondition: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is less than -1
Program fragment:
```
if r >= s[i]:
    shares += r // s[i]
    r %= s[i]
else:
    break

```
Postcondition for if body: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is less than -1; `shares` is incremented by `r // s[i]`; `r` is `r % s[i]`
Postcondition for else body: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is less than -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with conditions on `c` based on `a` and `b`; variable `i` is less than -1. If `r >= s[i]`, `shares` is incremented by `r // s[i]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
