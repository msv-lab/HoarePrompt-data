`r` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. The values of other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is incremented by `r // s[i]` and it is impossible for the loop to execute again given the current constraints, `r` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`.

Output State: **`shares` is incremented by `r // s[i]` and it is impossible for the loop to execute again given the current constraints, `r` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`.**
