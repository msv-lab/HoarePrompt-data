`max_length` is assigned the value of `max_speed * t`. 

Given:
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`
- `t` is an input integer within its respective range

Therefore, `max_length` is calculated as the product of `max_speed` and `t`.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max_speed * t`**
