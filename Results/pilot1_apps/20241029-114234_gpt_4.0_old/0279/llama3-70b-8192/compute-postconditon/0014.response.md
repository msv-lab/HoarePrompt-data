Given the `while True` loop, there is no explicit condition that could prevent the loop from running in the next iteration. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one more time without needing to adjust any states. 

Thus, you simply need to repeat the program state as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`; `max_length` is updated to `max_speed * t + max_speed`; `min_length` is updated to `min_speed * t + min_speed`; `iter_i` is an iterator over the range from `t - 1` to `1` decreasing by `1`; `i` is the next value of `iter_i`; `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`**
