`min_speed` is assigned the value of the minimum of `v1` and `v2`. Given that `v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100, `min_speed` will also be an integer within this range. The values of `t`, `d`, and `max_speed` are not affected.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`**.
