Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are input integers within their respective ranges; `max_speed` is the maximum speed after all iterations, `min_speed` is the minimum speed after all iterations, `max_length` is the total length updated by adding `max_speed` in each iteration, `min_length` is the total length updated by adding `min_speed` in each iteration, `iter_i` is exhausted, and the loop exits. If `t` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `max_length` and `min_length` will remain as `max_speed * t` and `min_speed * t`, respectively.**
