You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with a function description and a Python function code snippet. You need to provide if the code does what the function description says. Please avoid describing how the program runs. If the code satisfies the description reply CORRECT, otherwise reply INCORRECT with an explanation. You must adhere to the text format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.

Description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Python Fucntion:
```
v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
t, d = map(int, input().split())

max_speed = max(v1, v2)
min_speed = min(v1, v2)

max_length = max_speed * t
min_length = min_speed * t

for i in range(t-1, 0, -1):
    max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
    min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
    max_length += max_speed
    min_length += min_speed

print(max_length)

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Use the format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.
