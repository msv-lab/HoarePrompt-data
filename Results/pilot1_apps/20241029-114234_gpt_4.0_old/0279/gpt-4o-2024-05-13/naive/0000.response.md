RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The code attempts to find speeds for each second in such a way that the difference between the speeds of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed \(d\). However, it incorrectly computes the speeds in the loop. Specifically, the logic inside the `for` loop does not ensure that the speeds are maximized while still meeting the constraints. The condition `min(speeds[i-1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` does not properly handle the case to ensure that each speed is maximized while maintaining the constraints.
