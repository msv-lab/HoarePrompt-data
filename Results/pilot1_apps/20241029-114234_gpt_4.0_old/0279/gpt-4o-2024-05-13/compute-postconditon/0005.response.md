i is assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros with length `t`, `i` is 1.
