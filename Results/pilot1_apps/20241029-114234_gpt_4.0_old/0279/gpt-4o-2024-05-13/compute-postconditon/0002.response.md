`speeds` is assigned a list of zeros with length `t`. The initial values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are not affected directly by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list of zeros with length `t`.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list of zeros with length `t`**
