`speeds[i]` is assigned the minimum value between `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. Given that `i` is 1, the previous value is `speeds[0]` which is `v1`. Therefore, the calculation is between `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros with length `t`, `i` is 1**
