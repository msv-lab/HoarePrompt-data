Given the initial state and the examples of the loop executing multiple times, let's analyze the loop and determine the final output state.

Initial State: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros with length `t`, `i` is 1.
```
while i < t:
    speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    i += 1
```

To determine the output state after the loop:

1. **Loop will not start if `t` is less than or equal to 1:**
   - If `t` ≤ 1, the condition `i < t` is false at the beginning, so the loop won't start.
   - The `speeds` list remains unchanged, with the first element as `v1`, the last element as `v2`, and `i` remains 1.

2. **General case when `t` > 1:**
   - For each iteration, the `i`-th element of `speeds` is updated based on the minimum of the previous element plus `d` and a value derived from `v2`.
   - The loop increments `i` until it reaches `t`.
   - The final value of `i` will be `t` after the loop ends.

Considering these points, the possible scenarios and output states are:

1. **Case when `t` ≤ 1:**
   Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros with length `t`, `i` is 1.**

2. **Case when `t` > 1:**
   - After all iterations, the `speeds` list will be populated as described in the examples.
   - The last element of `speeds` will be `v2`.
   - The value of `i` will be `t`.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the `i`th element is `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` for each `i` from 1 to `t-1`, and the last element is `v2`, `i` is `t`. If `t` ≤ 1, `speeds` remains unchanged, and `i` is 1.**
