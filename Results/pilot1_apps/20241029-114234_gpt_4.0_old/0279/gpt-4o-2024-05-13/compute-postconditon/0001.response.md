`t` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()` which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Therefore, the output state is that `v1` and `v2` remain as input integers, and `t` and `d` become new input integers.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` and `d` are new input integers**
