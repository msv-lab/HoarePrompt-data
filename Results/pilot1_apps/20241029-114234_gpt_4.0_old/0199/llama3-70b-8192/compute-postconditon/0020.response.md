Postcondition: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, if `total` is less than `s`, `low` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1`. Additionally, `mid` is updated to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in `v`, and `low < high`.**
