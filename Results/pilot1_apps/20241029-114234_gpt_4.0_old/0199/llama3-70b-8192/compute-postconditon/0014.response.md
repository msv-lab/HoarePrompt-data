Postcondition: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is set to `mid` if `total` is less than `s`, otherwise `high` is set to `mid - 1`, `mid` and `total` are unchanged.**

This postcondition ensures that the state transitions described in the if and else parts are correctly reflected, and also captures any edge cases that the boundary values of the conditions might introduce. The variables' new values or the unchanged state are accurately summarized.
