`v` is assigned the value of a list of integers obtained from the input. The list of integers is derived by splitting the input string and converting each split element to an integer. The initial state specifies that `v` is already a list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9. Therefore, the input given to `map(int, input().split())` should match the initial state constraints. The other variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9**
