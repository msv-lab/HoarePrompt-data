`low` is assigned the value of `mid`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is `mid`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is unchanged, `total` is unchanged.
