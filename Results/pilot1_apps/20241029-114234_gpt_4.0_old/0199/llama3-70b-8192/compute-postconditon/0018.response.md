`low` is assigned the value of `mid`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9, `low` is set to `mid`, `high` is set to `mid - 1` if `total` is not less than `s`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v, and `low < high`**
