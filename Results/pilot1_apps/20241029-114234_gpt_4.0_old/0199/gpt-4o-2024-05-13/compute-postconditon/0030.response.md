`i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is less than -2, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer, variable `i` is increased by 1**
