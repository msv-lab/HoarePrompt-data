To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to look at the loop condition `i < 0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 0. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, we need:
- `n + 1` to be less than 0, which implies `n < -1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since the loop condition solely depends on `i`.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is less than -1**
