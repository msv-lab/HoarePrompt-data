`remaining_kvass` is decremented by the value of `possible_to_take`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is decremented by `possible_to_take`, `i` is assigned the value of `n`, `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`.

Output State: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is decremented by `possible_to_take`, `i` is assigned the value of `n`, `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`**
