Postcondition: **`n` is less than -2, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer. If `volumes[i]` (where `i = n + 2`) is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop continues without changing `remaining_kvass`. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is the minimum of `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.**
