Postcondition: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is less than -1. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the most recent loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is the minimum value between `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.**
