Postcondition: **`n` and `s` are input integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of integers, `total_volume` is the sum of elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the first element of `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is an input integer, `i` is assigned the value of `n`. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, the loop or the innermost if statement is terminated.**
