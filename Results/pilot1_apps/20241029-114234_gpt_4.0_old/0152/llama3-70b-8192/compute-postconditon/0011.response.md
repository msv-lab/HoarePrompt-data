The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. It does not directly alter the values of any variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s` are input integers. `a`, `b`, `c` are lists of input integers. `d` is a list of input integers from input().split() converted to integers. `ans` is positive infinity. `i` is `m + 1`. If `m + 1` equals `m`, then `t` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `t` is set to the element in the `a` list at the index `m + 1`.**
