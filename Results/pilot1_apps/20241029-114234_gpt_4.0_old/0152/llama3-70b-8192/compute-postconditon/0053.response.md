Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1. If `j` is initially greater than or equal to `k`, or `s_left` is initially less than `d[0]`, the loop does not start and the state remains the same. Otherwise, `s_left` is decremented by the sum of `d[j]` for each iteration until `j` is no longer less than `k` or `s_left` is less than `d[j]`. `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration; `j` is decremented by 1. If `j` is not equal to -1, `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`. `ans` is assigned the value of `min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)`**
