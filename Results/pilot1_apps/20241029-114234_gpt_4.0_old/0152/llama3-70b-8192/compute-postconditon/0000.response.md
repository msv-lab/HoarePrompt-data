`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, where `input` accepts a string of space-separated integers, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are thus updated based on the input. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers**
