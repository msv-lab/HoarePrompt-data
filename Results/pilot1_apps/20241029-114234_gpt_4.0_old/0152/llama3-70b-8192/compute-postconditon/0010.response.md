Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s` are input integers. `a`, `b`, `c` are lists of input integers. `d` is a list of input integers from input().split() converted to integers. `ans` is positive infinity. `i` is `m + 1`. If `m + 1` equals `m`, then `t` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `t` is set to the element in the `a` list at the index `m + 1`.**
