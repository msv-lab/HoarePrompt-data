To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop condition:

```
while j < k and s_left >= d[j]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

1. **Condition Analysis**:
    - The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]` are true.

2. **Current State**:
    - Variables: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s` are input integers.
    - Lists: `a`, `b`, `c` are lists of input integers.
    - List `d` contains integers from `input().split()` converted to integers.
    - Variable `ans` is positive infinity.
    - Variable `i` is `m + 1`.
    - Conditional assignment of `t`: If `m + 1` equals `m`, then `t` is set to `x`; otherwise, `t` is set to the element in the `a` list at the index `m + 1`.
    - Conditional check: If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues without executing further code in the current iteration.
    - Variable `s_left` is `s - b[i] - d[j] - d[j]`.
    - Variable `j` is incremented by 2.

3. **State Adjustment**:
    - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both conditions `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]` must hold true.
    - `j < k` ensures that `j` is within the bounds of the list `d`.
    - `s_left >= d[j]` ensures that `s_left` is sufficient to cover the value at `d[j]`.

4. **Given Current State**:
    - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been incremented by 2, so the new value of `j` needs to be within the bounds of the list `d` (i.e., `j < k`).
    - `s_left` must be sufficient to cover `d[j]` (i.e., `s_left >= d[j]`).

5. **Adjustments**:
    - Ensure `j` is within the bounds of `k`.
    - Ensure `s_left` is sufficient to cover the value at `d[j]`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s` are input integers; `a`, `b`, `c` are lists of input integers; `d` is a list of integers from `input().split()` converted to integers; `ans` is positive infinity; `i` is `m + 1`; if `m + 1` equals `m`, then `t` is set to `x`; otherwise, `t` is set to the element in the `a` list at the index `m + 1`; if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues without executing further code in the current iteration; `s_left` is `s - b[i] - d[j] - d[j]`; `j` is incremented by 2 and `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]`**
