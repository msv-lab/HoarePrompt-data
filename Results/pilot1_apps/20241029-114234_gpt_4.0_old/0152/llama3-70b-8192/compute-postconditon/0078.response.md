The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The initial state does not provide any information about the value of `i`. Other variables in the initial state are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1, `j` is decreased by 1, if `j` is not -1, `cnt` is set to `c[j-1]`, `ans` is set to `min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)**
