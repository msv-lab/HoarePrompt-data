`i` is assigned the value `m + 1`, where `m` is an input integer. Therefore, we add 1 to the value of `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `x` and `s` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `c` is a list of input integers, `d` is a list of input integers from input().split() converted to integers, `ans` is positive infinity, `i` is `m + 1`**
