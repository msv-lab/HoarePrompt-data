`s_left` is decremented by `d[j]`, where `j` is 3. The values of `m`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1. `s_left` is decremented by `d[1]`, `d[2]`, and `d[3]`, and is greater than or equal to `d[3]`. `j` is 3. `k` is greater than 3. `s_left` is decremented by `d[3]`.

Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1. `s_left` is decremented by `d[1]`, `d[2]`, and `d[3]`, and is greater than or equal to `d[3]`. `j` is 3. `k` is greater than 3. `s_left` is decremented by `d[3]`.**
