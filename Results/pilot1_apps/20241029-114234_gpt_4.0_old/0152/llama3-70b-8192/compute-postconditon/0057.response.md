`t` is assigned the value `a[i]`. Since `i` is less than -1, `i` could be any negative integer less than -1. Therefore, `t` is assigned the value of the element at index `i` in the array `a`. The specific value of `t` depends on the value of `i` and the contents of `a`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `t` is assigned `a[i]`**
