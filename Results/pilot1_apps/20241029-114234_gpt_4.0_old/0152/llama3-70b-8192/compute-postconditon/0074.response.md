`cnt` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state mentioned that `j` is decreased by 1, which means the specific value of `j` is unknown but it has been decreased by 1. The output state includes the updated state of `cnt` and the unchanged description of `j`. Therefore, the output state is: variable `j` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is 0.

Output State: **variable `j` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is 0**
