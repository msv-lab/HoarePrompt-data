Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step-by-step to understand what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is decreased by 1.
- If `j` is not equal to -1, `cnt` is set to `c[j]`.
- `ans` is assigned the value `min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)`.
- `i` is increased by 1.

The `while` loop condition:
```
while i < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `i < 0` holds true after the state adjustments.

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than 0 after this increment.
2. Therefore, before the increment, `i` must be less than -1. 

No other variables (`j`, `cnt`, `ans`, `c[j]`, `n`, `t`) directly affect the loop condition, so these do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `i` is less than -1 before it is incremented.

State: **`j` is decreased by 1, If `j` is not equal to -1, `cnt` is set to `c[j]`, `ans` is assigned the value `min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)`, `i` is less than -1**
