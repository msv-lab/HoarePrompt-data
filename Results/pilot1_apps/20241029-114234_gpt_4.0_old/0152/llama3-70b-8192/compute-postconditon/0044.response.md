To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to closely examine the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while j < k and s_left >= d[j]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]` are true. Let's analyze the state given at the end of the previous iteration:

1. `j` is 3.
2. `k` is greater than 2.
3. `s_left` is decremented by `d[1]` and is greater than or equal to `d[2]`.
4. `s_left` is decremented by `d[2]`.

The following conditions are necessary for the loop to execute one more time:

1. **Condition `j < k`**:
   - `j` is currently 3.
   - `k` is greater than 2. To ensure `j < k`, `k` must be greater than 3.

2. **Condition `s_left >= d[j]`**:
   - `s_left` is decremented by `d[1]` and `d[2]` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - We need to ensure that `s_left` is still greater than or equal to `d[3]` (since `j` is 3).

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the states need to be modified as follows:
- `k` should be greater than 3 (ensuring `j < k`).
- `s_left` should be greater than or equal to `d[3]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1. `s_left` is decremented by `d[1]` and `d[2]` and is greater than or equal to `d[3]`. `j` is 3. `k` is greater than 3.**
