`s_left` is decremented by `d[j]`. The previous values of `s_left` and `d[j]` are unknown, so their specific new value cannot be determined. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1. `s_left` is decremented by `d[j]`, `j` is 0.**
