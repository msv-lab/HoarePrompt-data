Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s` are input integers; `a`, `b`, `c` are lists of input integers; `d` is a list of integers from `input().split()` converted to integers; `ans` is positive infinity; `i` is `m + 1`; if `m + 1` equals `m`, then `t` is set to `x`; otherwise, `t` is set to the element in the `a` list at the index `m + 1`; if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues without executing further code in the current iteration; `s_left` is `s - b[i] - d[j] - d[j]`; `j` is incremented by 2**.
