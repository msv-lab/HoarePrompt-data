Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1. `s_left` is decremented by `d[1]` and is greater than or equal to `d[2]`. `j` is 3. `k` is greater than 2. `s_left` is decremented by `d[2]`.**
