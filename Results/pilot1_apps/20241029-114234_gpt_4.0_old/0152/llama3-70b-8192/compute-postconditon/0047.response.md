To determine the necessary adjustments to the state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the loop's condition:

```
while j < k and s_left >= d[j]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop can continue running as long as both conditions `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]` are true. Let's analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `m` and `n` are integers.
- Depending on the value of `n`, `m` could have been modified.
- `s_left` is decremented by `d[1]`, `d[2]`, and `d[3]`, and is greater than or equal to `d[3]`.
- `j` is 4.
- `k` is greater than 3.
- `s_left` is decremented by `d[3]`.

To keep the loop running, we need to focus on the conditions `j < k` and `s_left >= d[j]`:

1. **Condition `j < k`:**
   - `j` is currently 4.
   - `k` is greater than 3, so `k` must be at least 4 for the loop to have run previously. To ensure the loop can run again, `k` must be greater than 4.

2. **Condition `s_left >= d[j]`:**
   - `j` is 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `s_left` must be greater than or equal to `d[4]`.

Since `s_left` is already decremented by `d[3]` and is greater than or equal to `d[3]`, we need to ensure that after the last iteration, `s_left` is still greater than or equal to `d[4]`.

Combining these observations, the modified state to ensure the loop can run one more time should be:

State: **`m` and `n` are integers, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[4]`, `j` is 4, `k` is greater than 4**
