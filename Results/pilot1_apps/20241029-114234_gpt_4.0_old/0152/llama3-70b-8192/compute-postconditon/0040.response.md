`j` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`m`, `n`, and `s_left`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` is divisible by 3, `m` is multiplied by 2. If `n % 3 == 1`, `m` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m` is decremented by 1. `s_left` is decremented by `d[j]`, `j` is 1.**
