Postcondition: **variable `i` is less than -1. If `i` equals `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value of `a[i]`.**

Now, let's move on to your task.

Precondition: `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers
Program fragment:
```
if k < len(arr):
    arr[k] = 100
elif k == len(arr):
    arr.append(100)
else:
    arr.extend([0] * (k - len(arr) + 1))
    arr[k] = 100

```
Postcondition for if body: `arr[k]` is updated to 100
Postcondition for else body: If `k` == `len(arr)`, 100 is appended to the list. Otherwise, `arr` is extended by `k - len(arr) + 1` zeros, and then `arr[k]` is set to 100.
Postcondition: **`k` is an integer and `arr` is a list of integers. If `k` is less than the length of `arr`, then `arr[k]` is set to 100. If `k` is equal to the length of `arr`, then 100 is appended to the list. If `k` is greater than the length of `arr`, then `arr` is extended by `k - len(arr) + 1` zeros, and `arr[k]` is set to 100.**
