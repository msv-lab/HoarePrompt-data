`t` is assigned the value `a[i]`. The value of `i` is `m + 1`, and `a` is a list of input integers. Therefore, `t` is the element in the `a` list at the index `m + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `x` and `s` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `c` is a list of input integers, `d` is a list of input integers from input().split() converted to integers, `ans` is positive infinity, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` is the element in the `a` list at the index `m + 1`**
