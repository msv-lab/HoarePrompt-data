`cnt` is assigned the value `c[j]`. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, but it will change to the value of `c[j]`. The value of `j` is decreased by 1, so it is `j-1`. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is `c[j-1]`.

Output State: **variable `j` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is `c[j-1]`**
