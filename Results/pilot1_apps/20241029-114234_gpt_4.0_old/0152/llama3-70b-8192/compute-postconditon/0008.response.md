`t` is assigned the value of `x`, and `x` is an input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `x` and `s` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `c` is a list of input integers, `d` is a list of input integers from input().split() converted to integers, `ans` is positive infinity, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` is an input integer**
