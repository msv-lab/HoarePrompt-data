`c` is assigned the value of a list of integers obtained from the input, split into individual string segments and then mapped to integers. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `c` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `x` and `s` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `c` is a list of input integers**
