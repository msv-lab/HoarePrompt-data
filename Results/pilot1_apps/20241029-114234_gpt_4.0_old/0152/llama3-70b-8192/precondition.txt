n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, m and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5. x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9. a is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ a_i < x. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 2·10^9. c is a list of k integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n and c_i are non-decreasing. d is a list of k integers such that 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 2·10^9 and d_i are non-decreasing.
