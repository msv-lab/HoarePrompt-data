If `m >= -1`, the loop will not execute, `ans` will be positive infinity, and `i` will be `m + 1`. If `m < -1`, the loop will execute and `ans` will be the minimum computed value based on the loop logic, and `i` will be 0 after the loop terminates. Edge cases where `i` is out of bounds for `a` and `b` are not handled. `ans` is printed.
