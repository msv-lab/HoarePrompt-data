You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Anton is playing a very interesting computer game, but now he is stuck at one of the levels. To pass to the next level he has to prepare n potions.

Anton has a special kettle, that can prepare one potions in x seconds. Also, he knows spells of two types that can faster the process of preparing potions.  Spells of this type speed up the preparation time of one potion. There are m spells of this type, the i-th of them costs b_{i} manapoints and changes the preparation time of each potion to a_{i} instead of x.  Spells of this type immediately prepare some number of potions. There are k such spells, the i-th of them costs d_{i} manapoints and instantly create c_{i} potions. 

Anton can use no more than one spell of the first type and no more than one spell of the second type, and the total number of manapoints spent should not exceed s. Consider that all spells are used instantly and right before Anton starts to prepare potions.

Anton wants to get to the next level as fast as possible, so he is interested in the minimum number of time he needs to spent in order to prepare at least n potions.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of potions, Anton has to make, the number of spells of the first type and the number of spells of the second type.

The second line of the input contains two integers x and s (2 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^9, 1 ≤ s ≤ 2·10^9) — the initial number of seconds required to prepare one potion and the number of manapoints Anton can use.

The third line contains m integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < x) — the number of seconds it will take to prepare one potion if the i-th spell of the first type is used.

The fourth line contains m integers b_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints to use the i-th spell of the first type.

There are k integers c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) in the fifth line — the number of potions that will be immediately created if the i-th spell of the second type is used. It's guaranteed that c_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. c_{i} ≤ c_{j} if i < j.

The sixth line contains k integers d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of manapoints required to use the i-th spell of the second type. It's guaranteed that d_{i} are not decreasing, i.e. d_{i} ≤ d_{j} if i < j.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum time one has to spent in order to prepare n potions.


-----Examples-----
Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
20 10 40
4 15
10 80

Output
20

Input
20 3 2
10 99
2 4 3
200 100 400
4 15
100 800

Output
200



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the optimum answer is to use the second spell of the first type that costs 10 manapoints. Thus, the preparation time of each potion changes to 4 seconds. Also, Anton should use the second spell of the second type to instantly prepare 15 potions spending 80 manapoints. The total number of manapoints used is 10 + 80 = 90, and the preparation time is 4·5 = 20 seconds (15 potions were prepared instantly, and the remaining 5 will take 4 seconds each).

In the second sample, Anton can't use any of the spells, so he just prepares 20 potions, spending 10 seconds on each of them and the answer is 20·10 = 200.
Program:
```
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
x, s = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = list(map(int, input().split()))
d = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = float('inf')
for i in range(m + 1):
    if i == m:
        t = x
    else:
        t = a[i]
    if b[i] > s:
        continue
    s_left = s - b[i]
    j = 0
    while j < k and s_left >= d[j]:
        s_left -= d[j]
        j += 1
    j -= 1
    cnt = 0
    if j != -1:
        cnt = c[j]
    ans = min(ans, (n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t)

print(ans)

```
