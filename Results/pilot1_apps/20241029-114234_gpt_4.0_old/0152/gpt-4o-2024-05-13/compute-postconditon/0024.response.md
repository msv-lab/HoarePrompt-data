Postcondition: **`i` is `m`, `min_time` remains `n * x` if `b[m]` is greater than `s`, otherwise `min_time` is the minimum of `n * x` and `n * a[m]`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, `time_with_spell` is `n * a[m]` if `b[m]` is less than or equal to `s`.**

Precondition: `score` is an integer, `grade` is an empty string
Program fragment:
```
if score >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
elif score >= 70:
    grade = 'C'
elif score >= 60:
    grade = 'D'
else:
    grade = 'F'
```
Postcondition for if body: `grade` is set to 'A'
Postcondition for elif bodies: If `score` is greater than or equal to 80 but less than 90, `grade` is set to 'B'. If `score` is greater than or equal to 70 but less than 80, `grade` is set to 'C'. If `score` is greater than or equal to 60 but less than 70, `grade` is set to 'D'.
Postcondition for else body: `grade` is set to 'F'
Postcondition: **`score` is an integer, `grade` is a string. If `score` is greater than or equal to 90, `grade` is set to 'A'. If `score` is greater than or equal to 80 but less than 90, `grade` is set to 'B'. If `score` is greater than or equal to 70 but less than 80, `grade` is set to 'C'. If `score` is greater than or equal to 60 but less than 70, `grade` is set to 'D'. Otherwise, `grade` is set to 'F'.**
