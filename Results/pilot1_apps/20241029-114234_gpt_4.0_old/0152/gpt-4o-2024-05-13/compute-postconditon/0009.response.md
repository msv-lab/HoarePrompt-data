`time_with_spell` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * x`. The value of `remaining_potions` is given as `max(0, n - c[i])`, and `x` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `time_with_spell` is `remaining_potions * x`, where `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])` and `x` is undefined. 

Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])`, `time_with_spell` is `remaining_potions * x`**
