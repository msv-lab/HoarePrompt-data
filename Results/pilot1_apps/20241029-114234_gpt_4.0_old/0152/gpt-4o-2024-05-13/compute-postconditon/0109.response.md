`remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`. The previous values of `n` and `c` are not provided, but `j` is less than 0 before increment, and `c` is a list of integers. Therefore, `c[j]` refers to an element from the end of the list `c` since `j` is negative. The output state is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than 0 before increment and increased by 1, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`**
