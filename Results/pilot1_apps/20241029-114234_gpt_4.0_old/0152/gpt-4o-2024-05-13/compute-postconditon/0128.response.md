`k` is assigned the value `int(data[2])`. The previous values for other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned `int(data[0])`, `m` is assigned `int(data[1])`, `k` is assigned `int(data[2])`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned `int(data[0])`, `m` is assigned `int(data[1])`, `k` is assigned `int(data[2])`**
