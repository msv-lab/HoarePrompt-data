Output State: **`n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `j` is incremented by 1. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
