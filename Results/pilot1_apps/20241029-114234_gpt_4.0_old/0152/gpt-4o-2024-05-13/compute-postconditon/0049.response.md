Output State: **`time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`; `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`; `i` is assigned the value of `m`; `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`; `j` is assigned the value of `k`; `k` is less than -1; `min_time` is the minimum of its initial value (`n * x`) and the calculated `time_with_spell` values**
