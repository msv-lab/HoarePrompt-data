According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than 0 after increasing by 1. 

To ensure this, `j` must have been less than -1 before it was increased by 1 in the previous iteration. This means that before the increase, `j` should have been less than -1 so that after increasing by 1, it remains less than 0.

State: **`num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than 0 before increment and increased by 1**
