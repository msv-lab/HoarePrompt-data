`time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value `remaining_potions * a[i]`. The other variables (`num`, `lst`, `j`, and `remaining_potions`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than 0 before increment and increased by 1, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`**
