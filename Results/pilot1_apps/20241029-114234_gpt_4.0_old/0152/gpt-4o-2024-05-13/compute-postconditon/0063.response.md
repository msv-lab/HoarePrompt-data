Precondition: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are lists of integers, and `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `x` are integers. `min_time` is an integer initialized to some value, typically `n * x`.

Program fragment:
```
if b[i] <= s:
    remaining_manapoints = s - b[i]
    j = k
    while j < 0:
        if d[j] <= remaining_manapoints:
            remaining_potions = max(0, n - c[j])
            time_with_both_spells = remaining_potions * a[i]
            min_time = min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)
        else:
            break
        j += 1
```

Postcondition for if body: If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, `remaining_manapoints` is set to `s - b[i]`, and `j` is assigned the value of `k`. While `j` is less than 0, if `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as `max(0, n - c[j])`, and `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`. The `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. If `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`, the loop breaks. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code

Postcondition: **If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `remaining_manapoints` is set to `s - b[i]`, and `j` is assigned the value of `k`. While `j` is less than 0, if `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as `max(0, n - c[j])`, and `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`. The `min_time` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. If `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`, the loop breaks. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the code does not change the initial state.**
