Precondition: `temperature` is an integer, `weather` is a string
Program fragment:
```
if temperature < 0:
    weather = 'freezing'
elif temperature == 0:
    weather = 'cold'
else:
    weather = 'warm'

```
Postcondition for if body: `weather` is set to 'freezing'
Postcondition for else body: If `temperature` is 0, `weather` is set to 'cold'. Otherwise, `weather` is set to 'warm'.
Postcondition: **`temperature` is an integer, `weather` is a string. If `temperature` is less than 0, `weather` is set to 'freezing'. If `temperature` is 0, `weather` is set to 'cold'. Otherwise, `weather` is set to 'warm'.**
