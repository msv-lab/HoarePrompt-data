`remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[i])`. The previous values of `n` and `c[i]` are unknown. The value of `i` is less than -1. Therefore, the output state is: variable `i` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])`.

Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])`**
