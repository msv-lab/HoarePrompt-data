`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is `k`, so the new value of `j` is `k + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`, `j` is `k + 1`, if `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is the minimum of `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the current loop or if statement.**
