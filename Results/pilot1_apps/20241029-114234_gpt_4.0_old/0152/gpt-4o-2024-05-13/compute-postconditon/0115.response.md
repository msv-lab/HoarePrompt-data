To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's examine the variables and the conditions of the `while` loop:

1. The loop condition is `while j < 0`.
2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 0.

Given:
- `j` is less than or equal to 0 before increment and increased by 1

Currently, `j` is less than or equal to 0, and it's incremented by 1 at the end of the iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must still be less than 0 after the increment. This means that `j` must be less than -1 before the increment so that after the increment by 1, `j` will still be less than 0.

None of the other states (`num`, `lst`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, `min_time`) mentioned affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the state needed for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`num` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `j` is less than -1 before increment and increased by 1, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, `min_time` are unchanged**
