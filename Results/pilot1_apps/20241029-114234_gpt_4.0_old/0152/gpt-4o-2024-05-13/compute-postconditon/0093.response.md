`remaining_manapoints` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`. The value of `i` is less than -1, which means it refers to an element in `b` from the end of the list (i.e., the absolute value of `i` is greater than 1). Therefore, the new state includes the calculation of `remaining_manapoints` as `s - b[i]`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `remaining_manapoints` is `s - b[i]`**
