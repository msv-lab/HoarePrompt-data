According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute once more, `j` must still be less than 0 after being increased by 1. 

Let's consider the initial value of `j` before the increment:
- Before the increment, if `j` was `-1`, then after incrementing by 1, `j` would become `0`, which would not satisfy the loop condition (`j < 0`).
- Therefore, before the increment, `j` must have been less than `-1` for `j` to still be less than 0 after the increment.

Thus, `j` must have been less than `-1` before the increment. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `j` is less than -1**
