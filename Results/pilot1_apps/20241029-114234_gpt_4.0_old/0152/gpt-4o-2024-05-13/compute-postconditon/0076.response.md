`time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * a[i]`, where `remaining_potions` is already assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `j` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value `remaining_potions * a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `j` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value `remaining_potions * a[i]`**
