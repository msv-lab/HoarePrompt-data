According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to 0. However, for the loop to certainly execute one more time, `i` must be strictly less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is less than 0**
