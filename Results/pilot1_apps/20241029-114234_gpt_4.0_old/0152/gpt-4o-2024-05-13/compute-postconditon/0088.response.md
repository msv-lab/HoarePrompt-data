According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. This means that for the current `j` to be less than 0 and for the loop to execute again, `j` must originally have been less than -1 before being incremented.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration must be adjusted to ensure `j` is still less than 0.

State: **`n` is a number, `m` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `j` is less than -1 and incremented by 1**
