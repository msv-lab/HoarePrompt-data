`min_time` is assigned the value `min(min_time, time_with_both_spells)`. The value of `min_time` depends on its previous state and the value of `time_with_both_spells`, which is `max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[j])`, `time_with_both_spells` is `max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i]`, `min_time` is `min(min_time, max(0, n - c[j]) * a[i])`**
