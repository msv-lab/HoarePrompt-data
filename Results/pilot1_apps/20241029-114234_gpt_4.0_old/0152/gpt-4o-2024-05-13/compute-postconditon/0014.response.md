`remaining_potions` is assigned the value `max(0, n - c[i])`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than 0, If `d[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])`, `time_with_spell` is `remaining_potions * x`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum of `min_time` and `time_with_spell`. Additionally, `remaining_potions` is `max(0, n - c[i])`.
