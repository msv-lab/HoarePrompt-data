If `i` is less than 0, `shares`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `i` remain the same. If `i` is 0 or greater and `shares` is greater than 0 after 1 iteration, `r` is updated to its current value plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, then `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, `shares`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same, and `i` is incremented by 1. Finally, `r` is printed.
