Output State: **If `i` is less than 0, the loop will not be executed and the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` will remain the same as the initial state. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop finishes, `shares` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop, and `i` will be incremented accordingly. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` will remain the same.**
