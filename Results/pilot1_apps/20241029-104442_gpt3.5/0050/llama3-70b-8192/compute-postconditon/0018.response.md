According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 0. Since `i` starts at an unspecified initial value, we need to adjust `i` to be less than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num1` and `num2` are integers. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, then `max_num` is assigned the value of `num1`. Otherwise, `max_num` is assigned the value of `num2`. `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than 0**
