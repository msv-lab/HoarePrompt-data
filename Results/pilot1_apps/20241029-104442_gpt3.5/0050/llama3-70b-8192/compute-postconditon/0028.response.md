Example Answer: 
`shares` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `i`, `m`, `n`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is assigned the value of `m`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same, `shares` is 0.
Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `m`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same, `shares` is 0**
