According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 0. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time, and there is no need to adjust any states.
State: **`r`, `shares`, `s`, `i` are integers. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the result of the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by `s[i]`. `num1` and `num2` are integers and `max_num` is assigned the greater value between `num1` and `num2`. `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is less than 0**
