Example Answer:
The input is split, converted to integers, and stored in list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers from the input**
