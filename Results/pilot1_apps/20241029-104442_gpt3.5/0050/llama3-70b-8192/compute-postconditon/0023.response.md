Output State: **`r`, `shares`, `s`, `i` are integers. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the result of the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by `s[i]`. `num1` and `num2` are integers and `max_num` is assigned the greater value between `num1` and `num2`. `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is less than 0. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program terminates. `i` is increased by 1**
