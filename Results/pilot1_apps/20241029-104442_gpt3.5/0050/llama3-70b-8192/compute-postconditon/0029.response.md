Example Answer:
Since the code snippet contains a `break` statement, the program will break out of the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside. The variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is assigned the value of `m`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `m`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement**
