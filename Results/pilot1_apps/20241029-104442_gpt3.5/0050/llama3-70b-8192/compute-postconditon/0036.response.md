Postcondition: **`shares`, `i` are integers, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` are variables. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding `shares` times `b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, `i` is less than 0, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b` remain the same, and the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.**
