Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, and then stored in list `b`. Since `s` is not updated or modified in the code snippet, the output state is `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers from the input, `b` contains the integers from the input split by spaces.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers from the input, `b` contains the integers from the input split by spaces**
