Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `num1` and `num2` are integers. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, then `max_num` is assigned the value of `num1`. Otherwise, `max_num` is assigned the value of `num2`. `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`num1` and `num2` are integers. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, then `max_num` is assigned the value of `num1`. Otherwise, `max_num` is assigned the value of `num2`. `i` is increased by 1**
