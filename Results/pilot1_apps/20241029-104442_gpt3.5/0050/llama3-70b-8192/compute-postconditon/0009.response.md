Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` contains the integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, and `i` is an integer within the specified range.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` contains the integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, and `i` is an integer within the specified range**
