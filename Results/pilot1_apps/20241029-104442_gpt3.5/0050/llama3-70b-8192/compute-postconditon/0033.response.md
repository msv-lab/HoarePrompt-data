Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The value of `i` is less than 0, and the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `b` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than 0, `n`, `m`, `r` is updated by adding shares times b[i], `s`, `b` remain the same.
Output State: **`i` is less than 0, `n`, `m`, `r` is updated by adding shares times b[i], `s`, `b` remain the same**
