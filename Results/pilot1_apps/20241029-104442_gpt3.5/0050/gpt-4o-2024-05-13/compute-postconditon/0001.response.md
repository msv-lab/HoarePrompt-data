Example Answer:
The list `s` is created by converting the input string into a list of integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers, but they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input**
