Example Answer: 
The code simply prints the value of `r`. Since there are no operations or changes to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`**
