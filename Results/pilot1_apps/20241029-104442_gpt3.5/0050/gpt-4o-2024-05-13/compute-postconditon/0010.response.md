Precondition: `str` is a string
Program fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
    return None

```
Postcondition for if body: the function returns None
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less than 3, the function returns None**

Precondition: variables can hold any values
Program fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    return n
else:
    return int(n)

```
Postcondition for if body: The function returns `n`
Postcondition for else body: The function returns `int(n)`
Postcondition: **if `n` is an integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function returns `int(n)**

Precondition: `x` is a positive integer
Program fragment:
```
if x < 2:
    return False
else:
    return True

```
Postcondition for if body: The function returns False
Postcondition for else body: The function returns True
Postcondition: **x is a positive integer, if x is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True**

Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    n = -n
    m += 1
elif n == 0:
    return m
else:
    n -= 13
    m += 1

```
Postcondition for if body: the integer `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
Postcondition for else body: If integer `n` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, `n` has been decreased by 13 and integer `m` is increased by 1.
Postcondition: **`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.**

Precondition: x is an integer, y is zero.
Program fragment:
```
if x > 0:
    if x > 10:
        y = x * 2
    else:
        y = x + 5

```
Postcondition for if body: `x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 10, then `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, then `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.**

Precondition: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`
Program fragment:
```
if max_sell_price <= min_buy_price:
    print(r)
else:
    max_shares = r // min_buy_price
    remaining_bourles = r % min_buy_price
    total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles
    print(total_bourles)

```
Postcondition for if body: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`
Postcondition for else body: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers, `s` is a list of integers created from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is an integer calculated from `r` and `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is the result of the calculation `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.
