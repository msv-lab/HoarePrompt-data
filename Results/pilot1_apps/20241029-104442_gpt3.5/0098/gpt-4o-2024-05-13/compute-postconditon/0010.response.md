Postcondition: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned values based on the next tuple in `possible_orientations`. If the sum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the maximum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, or the maximum of `w2` and `w3` is less than or equal to `a1` and the sum of `h2` and `h3` is less than or equal to `b1`, the function returns 'YES'.**

Precondition: `size` is a positive integer
Program fragment:
```
if size % 2 == 0:
    return True
else:
    return False
```
Postcondition for if body: If `size` is divisible by 2, the function returns True.
Postcondition for else body: If `size` is not divisible by 2, the function returns False.
Postcondition: **`size` is a positive integer. If `size` is divisible by 2, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.**
