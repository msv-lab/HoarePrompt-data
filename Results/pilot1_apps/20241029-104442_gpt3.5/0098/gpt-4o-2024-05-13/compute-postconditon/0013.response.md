According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body. Therefore, in this case, we simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`**
