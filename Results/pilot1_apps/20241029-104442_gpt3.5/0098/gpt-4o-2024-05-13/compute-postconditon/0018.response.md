A `StopIteration` exception could occur if there are no more elements to iterate over in the `iterator` object. After the `try` statement is executed, the program's state includes `possible_orientations` as a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`, and `n` is an integer. If the conditions are met, the function returns 'YES' for both cases of conditions. If a `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program will break out of the loop.
