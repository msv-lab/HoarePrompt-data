Example Answer:
`w2, h2, w3, h3` are assigned the values from the next tuple in the `iterator` object, which iterates over `possible_orientations`. The values of `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are extracted from the next tuple in the list, and the order is rearranged based on the tuple elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned new values based on the next tuple in the iterator.
Output State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3` are assigned new values based on the next tuple in the iterator**
