Example Answer:
The function returns the string 'NO'. Since the return statement does not change the state, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`**
