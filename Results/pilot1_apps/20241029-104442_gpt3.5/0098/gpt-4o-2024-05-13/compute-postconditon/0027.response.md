Example Answer: 
`a2` is assigned the value of the third element of `data` converted to an integer, and `b2` is assigned the value of the fourth element of `data` converted to an integer. Therefore, after execution, `a2` and `b2` hold the respective values of the third and fourth elements of `data` as integers. The states of `a1` and `b1` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`a1` is the first element of `data` as an integer, `b1` is the second element of `data` as an integer, `a2` is the third element of `data` as an integer, `b2` is the fourth element of `data` as an integer**
