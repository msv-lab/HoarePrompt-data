According to the code, the loop will always execute as it is a `while True` loop. Since there are no conditions to check for termination, the loop will keep iterating indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`**
