Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely until explicitly stopped or interrupted. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The program state at the end of the previous iteration, which includes `possible_orientations` as a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` and `iterator` as an iterator object over `possible_orientations`, can simply be repeated.
State: **`possible_orientations` is a list of four tuples with rearranged values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`; `iterator` is an iterator object over `possible_orientations`**
