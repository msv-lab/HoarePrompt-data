Functionality: The function func accepts integer parameters a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 with specific constraints. It iterates through different cases based on the conditions derived from rearranging the values of a2, b2, a3, b3 and returns 'YES' if the conditions are met in any of the iterations. If 'YES' is not returned after iterating through all possible orientations, it returns 'NO'. The function handles StopIteration exceptions during iteration. 

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality: 
1. The code does not handle the case where a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are not integers or do not fall within the given constraints.
2. If the list of possible orientations is empty, the function should return 'NO' instead of breaking out of the loop.
3. If the possible orientations list has less than four tuples, the function should return 'NO' as well.
4. The postconditions mention 'n' as an integer, but it is not used in the function.
