Example Answer:
`a3` and `b3` are assigned integer values based on user input using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `a1` and `b1` are unknown, but `a2` and `b2` are assigned new integer values based on user input. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `a1` and `b1` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a2` and `b2` are assigned new integer values based on user input, `a3` and `b3` are assigned integer values based on user input.
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a2` and `b2` are assigned new integer values based on user input, `a3` and `b3` are assigned integer values based on user input**
