Example Answer:
The code snippet only prints 'YES' and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a2` and `b2` are assigned new integer values based on user input, `a3` and `b3` are assigned integer values based on user input**
