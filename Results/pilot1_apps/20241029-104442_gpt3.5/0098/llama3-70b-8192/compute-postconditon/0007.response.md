Example Answer: 
The code simply prints 'NO' and does not affect the values of variables `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, and `b3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `b1` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a2` and `b2` are assigned new integer values based on user input, `a3` and `b3` are assigned integer values based on user input.
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a2` and `b2` are assigned new integer values based on user input, `a3` and `b3` are assigned integer values based on user input**
