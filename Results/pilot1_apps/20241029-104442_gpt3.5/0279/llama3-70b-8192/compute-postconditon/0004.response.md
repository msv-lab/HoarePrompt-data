Example Answer:
The value of `max_length` is calculated by multiplying `max_speed` by `t`. Since `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`, and `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`, `max_speed` will take the maximum of `v1` and `v2`. Therefore, `max_length` will be the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`, and `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`**
