Example Answer:
`max_speed` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. The new `max_speed` value depends on the previous values of `max_speed`, `d`, and `min_speed`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is updated value, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the product of `min_speed` and `t`, `iter_i` is an iterator starting from `t-1` and going down to 1 (excluding 0), and `i` is the next value of `iter_i`.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is updated value, `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the product of `min_speed` and `t`, `iter_i` is an iterator starting from `t-1` and going down to 1 (excluding 0), and `i` is the next value of `iter_i`**
