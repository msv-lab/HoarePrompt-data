Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is updated value, `min_speed` is the minimum value between the updated `min_speed` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the product of `min_speed` and `t`, `iter_i` is an iterator starting from `t-1` and going down to 1 (excluding 0), `i` is the next value of `iter_i`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`.**
