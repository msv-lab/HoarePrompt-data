Example Answer:
`min_speed` is assigned the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are based on user input, so the value of `min_speed` can be determined by comparing the user input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`, and `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`, and `min_speed` is the minimum value between `v1` and `v2`**
