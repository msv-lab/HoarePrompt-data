Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely until there is a break condition within the loop body. Therefore, the program state at the end of the previous iteration can simply be repeated for the next iteration.
State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `max_speed` is updated based on the calculation `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is the updated value, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t` plus `max_speed`, `min_length` is the product of `min_speed` and `t` plus the value of `min_speed`, `iter_i` is an iterator starting from `t-1` and going down to 1 (excluding 0), `i` is the next value of `iter_i`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`, `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`, `i` is assigned the next value of `iter_i`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is further incremented by `max_speed`, `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`**
