Example Answer:
`t` and `d` are assigned the values of integers obtained by using `map(int, input().split())`. The `input().split()` function splits the input based on spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts each split element into an integer. Therefore, after execution, `t` and `d` will hold the integer values obtained from user input.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned integer values based on user input, `t` is an integer, `d` is an integer**
