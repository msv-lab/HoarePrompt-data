Example Answer: 
v1 and v2 are assigned values based on the input split by space. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of v1 and v2. Therefore, the Output State is: v1 and v2 are assigned integer values based on user input, meeting the precondition requirements.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are assigned integer values based on user input, meeting the precondition requirements**
