Output State: **After the loop finishes, the `speeds` list will have updated values based on the minimum calculation for each index, `v1` will remain constant as `t`, `v2` will remain constant as `d`, and `i` will be equal to `t`. Ensure that the code accounts for the edge case where `t` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the loop will not execute and the initial values will remain unchanged. `total_distance` is the sum of `speeds`.**
