Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of the `speeds` list is updated with the minimum value between the sum of the value at index 0 and `d`, and `v2` added to the difference between `t`, `i`, and 1 times `d`. The previous values were `t` assigned to `v1`, `d` assigned to `v2`, `speeds` list with `t` at index 0 and `d` at the last index, and `i` as 2. After execution, the `speeds` list is updated at index 1 with the calculated value. 
Output State: **`v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0 and updated value at index 1, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index, `i` is 2**.
