According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `v1` is assigned to `t`, which means `t` is equal to `v1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `v1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index, `i` is 2, the `speeds` list is updated at index 1 with a new calculated value**
