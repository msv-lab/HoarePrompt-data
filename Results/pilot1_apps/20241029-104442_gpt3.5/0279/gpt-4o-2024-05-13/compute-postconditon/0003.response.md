Example Answer: 
`speeds[0]` is assigned the value of `v1`, and `v1` is assigned to `t`, so after execution, `speeds` list will have the value of `t` at index 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0.
Output State: **`v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0**
