Example Answer: 
`speeds[-1]` is assigned the value of `v2`, which is assigned to `d`. The initial values are `v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, and `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0. After execution, the `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index.
Output State: **`v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index**
