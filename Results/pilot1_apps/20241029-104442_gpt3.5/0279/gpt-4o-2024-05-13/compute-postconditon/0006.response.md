Example Answer: 
The value at index `i` of the `speeds` list is updated to be the minimum between two values: `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. The previous values are `t` assigned to `v1`, `d` assigned to `v2`, the `speeds` list having `t` at index 0 and `d` at the last index, and `i` being 1. After the calculation, the new value at index `i` is determined. 
Output State: **`v1` is assigned to `t`, `v2` is assigned to `d`, `speeds` list has the value of `t` at index 0, `speeds` list now has the value of `d` at the last index, `i` is 1, the `speeds` list is updated at index 1 with a new calculated value**
