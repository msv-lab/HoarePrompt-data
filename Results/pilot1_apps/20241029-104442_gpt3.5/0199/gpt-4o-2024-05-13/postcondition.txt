`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, `volumes` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of all integers in the list `volumes`. If total_volume is less than s, print -1. Otherwise, set `min_keg_volume` to the first element of `volumes`, initialize `remaining_kvass` to s, iterate through the list `volumes`, updating `remaining_kvass` based on the conditions, and finally adjust `min_keg_volume` if `remaining_kvass` is still greater than 0.
