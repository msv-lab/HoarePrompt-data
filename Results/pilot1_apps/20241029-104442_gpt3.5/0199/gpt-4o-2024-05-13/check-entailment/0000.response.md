Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the maximum possible volume in the least filled keg accurately by distributing the remaining kvass to make each keg as even as possible. The logic to check if the Fair Nut can pour his glass by s liters of kvass is implemented correctly.
