Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so after execution, `i` increases by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, the program will break out of the loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, `i` are the same as before.**
