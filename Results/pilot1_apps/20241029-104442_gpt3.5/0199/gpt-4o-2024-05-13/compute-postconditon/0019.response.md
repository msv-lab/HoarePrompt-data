Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, `volumes` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of all integers in the list `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the smallest volume in the list `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is the total volume of kvass. If the volume at index `i` in the list `volumes` is less than or equal to the minimum keg volume, the loop continues. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is calculated as the minimum value between the difference of the volume at index `i` and the minimum keg volume, and the remaining kvass. The remaining kvass is then updated by subtracting the `possible_to_take` amount.**
