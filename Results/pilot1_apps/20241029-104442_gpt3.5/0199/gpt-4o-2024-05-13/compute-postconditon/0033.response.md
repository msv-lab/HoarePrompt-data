Example Answer:
`min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting the result of `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. The variables `remaining_kvass` and `n` will retain their values. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, the loop will not start, and the initial state will remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `n` retain their respective values.
Output State: **`min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `n` retain their respective values**
