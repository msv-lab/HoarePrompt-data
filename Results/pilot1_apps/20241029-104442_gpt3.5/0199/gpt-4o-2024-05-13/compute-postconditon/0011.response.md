Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, `volumes` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of all integers in the list `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the smallest volume in the list `volumes`, `remaining_kvass` is the total volume of kvass. If volumes[i] is less than or equal to min_keg_volume, the loop continues with `i` remaining unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1, and `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum value between volumes[i] - min_keg_volume and remaining_kvass. In the latter case, remaining_kvass is updated by subtracting possible_to_take.**
