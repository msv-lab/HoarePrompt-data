According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to become greater than or equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass` remain the same, and `i` is increased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to 0**
