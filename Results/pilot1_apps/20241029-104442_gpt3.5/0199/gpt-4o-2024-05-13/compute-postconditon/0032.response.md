Output State: If `remaining_kvass` is 0, the loop will not start, and the initial state will remain the same. If `remaining_kvass` is not 0, the loop will run until `i` becomes greater than or equal to 0. Once the loop finishes, `n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` will retain their respective values.
