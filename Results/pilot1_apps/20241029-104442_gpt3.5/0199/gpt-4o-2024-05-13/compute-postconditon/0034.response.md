Postcondition: **If `remaining_kvass` is 0, the loop does not start, and the initial state remains unchanged. If `remaining_kvass` is not 0, the loop runs until `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Once the loop finishes, `n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` retain their respective values. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by the result of `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`.**
