Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned values based on the input provided by the user after splitting the input by space. Since the initial state does not mention any other variables, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, volumes is a list of n integers such that each element is in the range [1, 10^9].
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, volumes is a list of n integers such that each element is in the range [1, 10^9]**
