Example Answer:
The list `volumes` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer using `map`. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, volumes is a list of n integers such that each element is in the range [1, 10^9].
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, volumes is a list of n integers such that each element is in the range [1, 10^9]**
