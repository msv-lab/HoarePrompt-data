Example Answer:
`min_keg_volume` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `volumes`, which is `volumes[0]`. Since `volumes` is sorted in ascending order, `min_keg_volume` will be the smallest element in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, `volumes` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of all integers in the list `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the smallest volume in the list `volumes`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^3, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, `volumes` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of all integers in the list `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is the smallest volume in the list `volumes`**
