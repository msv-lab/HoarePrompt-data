According to the code, the loop condition is `i < 0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0 at the end of the previous iteration. Since `i` is already less than 0, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n`, `s`, `volumes`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, `i` are the same as before**
