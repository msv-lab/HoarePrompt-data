According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than `high`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already executed at least once, so we know that `low` is less than `high`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `low` should be adjusted to `mid` and `high` should be adjusted to `mid - 1`.
State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order. `low` is assigned the value of `mid`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`**
