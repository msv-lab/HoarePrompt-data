Example Answer:
The list `v` is assigned the values inputted from the user after being converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user**
