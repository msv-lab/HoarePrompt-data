Example Answer:
`mid` is calculated as `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The values of `low` and `high` are assigned to `mid` and `mid - 1` respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is assigned the value of `mid`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is assigned the value of `mid`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`**
