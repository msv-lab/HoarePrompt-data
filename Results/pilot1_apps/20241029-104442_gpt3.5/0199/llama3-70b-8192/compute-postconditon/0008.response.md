Postcondition: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is the minimum value in list `v`, `mid` is the calculated value, and `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for x in v if total is less than s. Otherwise, `low` is equal to `mid` and `high` is assigned the value of mid - 1.**
