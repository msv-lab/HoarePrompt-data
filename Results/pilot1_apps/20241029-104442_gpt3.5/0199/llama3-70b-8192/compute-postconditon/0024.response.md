Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints out the value of `low`. If the initial value of `low` is equal to or greater than `high`, the loop will not be executed, and `low` and `high` will retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` retains its initial value.
Output State: **`low` retains its initial value**
