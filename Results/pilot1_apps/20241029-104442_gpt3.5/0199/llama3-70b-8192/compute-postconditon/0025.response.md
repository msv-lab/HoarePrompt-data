Postcondition: **If the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element `x` in `v` is not equal to `s`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `low` retains its initial value. If the initial value of `low` is equal to or greater than `high`, the loop will not be executed, and in this case, `low` and `high` will retain their initial values.**
