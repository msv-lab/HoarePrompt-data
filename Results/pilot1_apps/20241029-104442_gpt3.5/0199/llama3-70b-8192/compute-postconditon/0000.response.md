Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned values by splitting the input. The values of `n` and `s` are positive integers based on the given precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: n and s are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; v is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i.
Output State: **n and s are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; v is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i**
