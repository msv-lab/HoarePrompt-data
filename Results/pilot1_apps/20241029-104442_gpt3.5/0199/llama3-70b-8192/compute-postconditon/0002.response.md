Example Answer:
The list `v` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the list `v` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^3 and 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n positive integers sorted in ascending order**
