Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Depending on the value of `x`, `y` will be set accordingly. If `x` is a non-negative even number, `y` will be half of `x`. If `x` is a non-negative odd number, `y` will be 3 times `x` plus 1. If `x` is negative, `y` will be -1. Additionally, `i` will be increased by 1. 
Output State: **If `x` is a number, then if `x` is non-negative and even, `y` is set to half of `x`. If `x` is non-negative and odd, `y` is set to 3 times `x` plus 1. If `x` is negative, `y` is set to -1. `i` is increased by 1.**
