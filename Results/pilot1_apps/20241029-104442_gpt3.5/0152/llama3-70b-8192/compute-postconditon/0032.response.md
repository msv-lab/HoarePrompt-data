Example Answer: 
`t` is assigned the value of `x`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment. The output state is: If j is not equal to -1, i is equal to m+1, t is the value of x, s_left is the value of s - b[i] - d[j], j is initialized to 0, and cnt is the value of c[j]. If j is -1, no changes are made to the variables.
Output State: **If j is not equal to -1, i is equal to m+1, t is the value of x, s_left is the value of s - b[i] - d[j], j is initialized to 0, and cnt is the value of c[j]. If j is -1, no changes are made to the variables**
