Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and the result of the expression `(n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t`. The values of `n`, `cnt`, and `t` are unknown, so the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `score` is an integer, `grade` is either "A", "B", "C", or "D", depending on the value of `ans`.
Output State: **`score` is an integer, `grade` is either "A", "B", "C", or "D", depending on the value of `ans`**
