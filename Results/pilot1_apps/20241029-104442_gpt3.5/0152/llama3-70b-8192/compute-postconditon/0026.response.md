Output State: **`i` is equal to `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value of `a` at index `i`. If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables. `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j]`. `j` is initialized to 0 after the loop finishes. `cnt` is initialized to 0**
