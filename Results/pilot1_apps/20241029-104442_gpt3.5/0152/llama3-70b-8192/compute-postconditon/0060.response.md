Postcondition: **`x` is a number, `i`, `m` are integers, `a` is a list of numbers. If `i` is equal to `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value at index `i` in the list `a`. If `x` is non-negative and even, `y` is set to half of `x`. If `x` is non-negative and odd, `y` is set to 3 times `x` plus 1. If `x` is negative, `y` is set to -1. `i` is increased by 1 in both cases. If the element at index `i` in list `b` is greater than `s`, the loop continues.**
