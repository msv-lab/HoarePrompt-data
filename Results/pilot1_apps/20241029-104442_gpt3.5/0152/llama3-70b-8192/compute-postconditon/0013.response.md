Output State: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `ans`, and `i` are integers. If `i` is equal to `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value of `a` at index `i`. If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables. `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`.
