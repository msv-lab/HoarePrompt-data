According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 0. Since `i` is the only variable that determines the loop execution, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`. It needs to be decremented by 1.
State: **Output State: If `x` is a number, then if `x` is non-negative and even, `y` is set to half of `x`. If `x` is non-negative and odd, `y` is set to 3 times `x` plus 1. If `x` is negative, `y` is set to -1. `i` is increased by 1.**
