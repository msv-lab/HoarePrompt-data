Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is guaranteed to be less than `k`. There are no other variables affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the updated result after subtracting `d[j]` from `s`, `j` is less than `k, and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`.
Output State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the updated result after subtracting `d[j]` from `s`, `j` is less than `k, and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`**
