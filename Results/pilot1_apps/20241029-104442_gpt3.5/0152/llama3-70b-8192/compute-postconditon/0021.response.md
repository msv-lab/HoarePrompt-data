Example Answer:
The value of `s_left` is decreased by the value of `d[j]`. The previous values of `s_left` and `d[j]` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `ans`, `i`, and `s_left` are integers, and `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `s`, `ans`, `i`, and `s_left` are integers, and `j` is incremented by 1**
