Example Answer:
`s_left` is updated by subtracting the value of `d[j]` from it. The value of `d[j]` is not mentioned in the initial state. Since `j` is 0, `d[j]` would refer to the value at index 0 of list `d`, which is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the result of subtracting `d[0]` from `s`, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the result of subtracting `d[0]` from `s`, `j` is 0**
