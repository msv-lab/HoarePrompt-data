Your task is to complete the postcondition of the following program fragment:

Precondition: variables can hold any values
Program fragment:
```
if x >= 0:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        y = x // 2
    else:
        y = 3 * x + 1
else:
    y = -1
```

Postcondition for if body: If `x` is non-negative and even, `y` is set to half of `x`. If `x` is non-negative and odd, `y` is set to 3 times `x` plus 1.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is negative, `y` is set to -1.
Postcondition: **If `x` is a number, then if `x` is non-negative and even, `y` is set to half of `x`. If `x` is non-negative and odd, `y` is set to 3 times `x` plus 1. If `x` is negative, `y` is set to -1.**
