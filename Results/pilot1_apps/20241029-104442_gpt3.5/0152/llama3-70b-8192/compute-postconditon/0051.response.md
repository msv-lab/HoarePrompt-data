Output State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the updated result after subtracting `d[j]` from `s`, `j` is less than `k, `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[j]`, `j` will be equal to the number of iterations performed, and `s_left` will be the final result after subtracting all elements from `d` where the sum is less than or equal to `s`, `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`**
