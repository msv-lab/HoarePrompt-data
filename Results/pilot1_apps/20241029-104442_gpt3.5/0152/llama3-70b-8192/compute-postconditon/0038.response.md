Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the result of subtracting `b[i]` from `s`, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the result of subtracting `b[i]` from `s`, `j` is 0**
