Output State: If `j` is not equal to -1, after the loop execution, `i` is equal to `m+1`, `t` is assigned the value of `x`, `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i] - d[j]`, `j` is initialized to 0, `cnt` is assigned the value of `c[j]`. If `j` is -1, after the loop execution, `i` is equal to `m`, `t` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, `s_left` is assigned the value of `s - b[i]`, `j` is equal to -1, and `cnt` remains 0. The code snippet does not impact the initial state of the variables.
