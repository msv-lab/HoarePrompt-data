Example Answer: 
A list `d` is created by mapping each element of the input split by spaces to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input**
