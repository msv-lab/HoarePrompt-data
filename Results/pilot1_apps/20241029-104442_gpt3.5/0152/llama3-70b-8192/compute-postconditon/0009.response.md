Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the value of `a` at index `i`. The value of `i` is dependent on the user input value of `m`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input; `ans` is positive infinity, and `i` is dependent on the user input value of `m`; `t` is assigned the value of `a` at index `i`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input; `ans` is positive infinity, and `i` is dependent on the user input value of `m`; `t` is assigned the value of `a` at index `i`**
