Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value of positive infinity. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input; `ans` is positive infinity.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input; `x` and `s` are assigned values based on user input; `ans` is positive infinity**
