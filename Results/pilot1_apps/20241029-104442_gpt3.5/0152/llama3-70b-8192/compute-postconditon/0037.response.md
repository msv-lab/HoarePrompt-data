Example Answer:
If `num` is even, it will be incremented by 1, and if `num` is odd, it will be decremented by 1. Then `s_left` is assigned the result of subtracting `b[i]` from `s`. The value of `s` and `b[i]` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `num` is an even or odd integer, and `s_left` is the result of subtracting `b[i]` from `s`.
Output State: **`num` is an even or odd integer, `s_left` is the result of subtracting `b[i]` from `s`**
