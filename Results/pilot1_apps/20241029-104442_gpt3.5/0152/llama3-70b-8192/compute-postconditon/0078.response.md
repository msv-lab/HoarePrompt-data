Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Since the code snippet does not affect any other variables, the output state is: `score` is an integer, `grade` is either "A", "B", "C", or "D", depending on the value of `ans`.
Output State: **`score` is an integer, `grade` is either "A", "B", "C", or "D", depending on the value of `ans`**
