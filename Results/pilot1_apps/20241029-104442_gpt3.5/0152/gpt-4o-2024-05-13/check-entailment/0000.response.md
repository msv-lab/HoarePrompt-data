Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both type of spells are used together in the optimal manner. The code only checks for using one type of spell at a time or using both types of spells independently. However, the optimal solution can involve using both types of spells together to minimize the preparation time. Therefore, the program does not provide the correct output for all potential cases.
