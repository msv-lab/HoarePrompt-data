Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `num1`, `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string, `result` is based on the operation, `j` is less than 1, `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated, `time_with_both_spells` is computed, and `min_time` is updated, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
