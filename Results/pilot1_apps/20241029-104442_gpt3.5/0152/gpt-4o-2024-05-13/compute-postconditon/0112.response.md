Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, `j + 1`, `n`, `c`, `a` remain as integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
