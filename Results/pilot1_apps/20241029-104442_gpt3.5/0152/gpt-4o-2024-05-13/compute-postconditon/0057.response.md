Example Answer: 
`min_time` is assigned the minimum value between `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`, where `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers and `j` is greater than or equal to 0; `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`; `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`.
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers and `j` is greater than or equal to 0; `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`; `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`**
