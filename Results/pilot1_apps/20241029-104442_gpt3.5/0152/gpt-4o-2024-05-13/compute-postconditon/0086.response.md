Postcondition: **`num1`, `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string, `result` is based on the operation, `j` is less than 1, `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated, `time_with_both_spells` is now set to `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is computed as `remaining_potions * a[i]`. Additionally, `min_time` is updated to the minimum of the current `min_time` and the calculated `time_with_both_spells`. If `d[j]` is greater than `remaining_manapoints`, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.**
