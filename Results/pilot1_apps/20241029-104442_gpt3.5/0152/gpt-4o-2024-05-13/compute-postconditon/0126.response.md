Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`, where `data[0]` is the first element of the split input values converted to an integer. The value of `n` will depend on the first element of the split input values. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer**
