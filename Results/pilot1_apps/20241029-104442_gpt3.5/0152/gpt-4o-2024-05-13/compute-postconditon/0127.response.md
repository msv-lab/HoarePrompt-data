Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the value of the second element in `data` converted to an integer. The value of the second element in `data` is unknown, as well as the value of `func`. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer**
