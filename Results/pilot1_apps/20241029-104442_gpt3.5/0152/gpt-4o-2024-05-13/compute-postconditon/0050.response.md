Example Answer:
`min_time` is assigned the minimum value between `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. The values of `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j` remain the same. The value of `time_with_both_spells` depends on the values of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers, and `time_with_both_spells` is dependent on the values of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`.
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers, and `time_with_both_spells` is dependent on the values of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]**
