Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[i]`. The values of `n`, `c`, and `i` are not provided, so the exact value of `remaining_potions` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` is the product of n and x, `i` is assigned the value of `k`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the product of n and x, `i` is assigned the value of `k`**
