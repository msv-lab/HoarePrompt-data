Example Answer:
The value of `j` is assigned the value of `k`, but the initial value of `k` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j` are updated based on the conditions of the initial state and the assignment of `i` to `m`.
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j` are updated based on the conditions of the initial state and the assignment of `i` to `m`**
