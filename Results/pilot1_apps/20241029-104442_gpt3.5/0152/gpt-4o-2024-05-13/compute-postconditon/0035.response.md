Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum between the previous value and `time_with_spell`, `i` is increased by 2 and is less than 0, `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]`. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]` and `min_time` is updated to the minimum of the previous `min_time` and `time_with_spell`.**
