According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been increased by 1. Since the loop condition is `j < 0`, `j` needs to be adjusted so that it is still less than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned, `j` has been increased by 1**
