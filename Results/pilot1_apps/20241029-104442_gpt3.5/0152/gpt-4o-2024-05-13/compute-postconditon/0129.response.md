Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the 4th element of `data`, which is an integer after conversion to an integer. The value of `x` is now determined based on the input values. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer, `k` is an integer assigned the value of the 3rd element of `data`, `x` is an integer.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `func` is defined but not executed, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an unknown integer, `k` is an integer assigned the value of the 3rd element of `data`, `x` is an integer**
