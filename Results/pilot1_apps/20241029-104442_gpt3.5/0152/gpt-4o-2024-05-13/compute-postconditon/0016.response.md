Example Answer:
`min_time` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_spell`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_spell`.
Output State: **`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_spell`**
