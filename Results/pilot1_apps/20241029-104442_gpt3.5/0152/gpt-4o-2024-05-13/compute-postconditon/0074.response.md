According to the code, the loop will only execute if `j` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been increased by 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` needs to be less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num1` and `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string, `result` is based on the operation, and `j` is less than 0**
