Output State: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`. If `d[j]` is not less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, the loop breaks.
