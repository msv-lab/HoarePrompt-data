Example Answer:
`time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * a[i]`. The value of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]` is unknown in the given initial state, but `j` is less than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` have been updated within the loop and `j` is less than 0, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on the unknown values.
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` have been updated within the loop and `j` is less than 0, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on the unknown values**
