Your Task:
Precondition: `num1` and `num2` are integers, and `operation` is a string representing a mathematical operation.
Program fragment:
```
if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
else:
    result = "Invalid operation"

```
Postcondition for if body: If `operation` is "+", `result` is assigned the sum of `num1` and `num2`.
Postcondition for else body: If `operation` is "-", `result` is assigned the difference between `num1` and `num2`. If `operation` is neither "+" nor "-", `result` is assigned the string "Invalid operation".
Postcondition: **`num1` and `num2` are integers, and `operation` is a string. If `operation` is "+", `result` is the sum of `num1` and `num2`. If `operation` is "-", `result` is the difference between `num1` and `num2`. If `operation` is neither "+", nor "-", `result` is "Invalid operation".**
