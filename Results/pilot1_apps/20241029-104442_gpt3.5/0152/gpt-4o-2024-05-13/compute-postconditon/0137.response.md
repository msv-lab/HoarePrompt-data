Your Task:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if x > y:
    x += y
elif x < y:
    x -= y
else:
    x = 0
```
Postcondition for if body: If `x` is greater than `y`, `x` is incremented by `y`.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is less than `y`, `x` is decremented by `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is set to 0.
Postcondition: **`x`, `y` are integers. If `x` is greater than `y`, `x` is incremented by `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, `x` is decremented by `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is set to 0.**
