According to the code, the loop condition is `i < 0`, which means the loop will only execute if `i` is less than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `min_time` is the minimum between the previous value and `time_with_spell`, `i` has been increased by 1, and `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]`. Since `i` has been increased by 1, to make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be less than 0.
State: **`min_time` is the minimum between the previous value and `time_with_spell`, `i` is increased by 1 and is less than 0, `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]`**
