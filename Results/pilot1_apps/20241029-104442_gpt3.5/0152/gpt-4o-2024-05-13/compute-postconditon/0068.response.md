Example Answer: 
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`. The previous values of `n` and `c[j]` are not provided, so the exact value of `remaining_potions` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j` are updated based on the initial conditions and the assignment of `i` to `m`, and `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`.
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j` are updated based on the initial conditions and the assignment of `i` to `m`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[j]`**
