Postcondition: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum of the current `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited with updated values of `min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, and `j`.**
