Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside because j is less than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: min_time, i, time_with_spell, remaining_manapoints, j have been updated based on the calculations within the loop and j is less than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **min_time, i, time_with_spell, remaining_manapoints, j have been updated based on the calculations within the loop and j is less than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
