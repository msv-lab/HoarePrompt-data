Example Answer: 
The variable `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of subtracting the value of `c[j]` from `n`. Since `j` is less than 0, the value of `c[j]` is unknown. Therefore, the state after execution is: `num1` and `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string, `result` is based on the operation, and `j` is less than 0. 
Output State: **`num1` and `num2` are integers, `operation` is a string, `result` is based on the operation, and `j` is less than 0**
