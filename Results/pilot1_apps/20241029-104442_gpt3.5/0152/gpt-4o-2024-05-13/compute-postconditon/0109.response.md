Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is assigned the value of `max(0, n - c[j])`, where `n` and `c[j]` are integers. The value of `remaining_potions` is calculated based on the previous values of `n` and `c[j]`. 
Output State: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, `j + 1`, `n`, `c`, `a` are integers; `remaining_potions` is updated based on the calculation**
