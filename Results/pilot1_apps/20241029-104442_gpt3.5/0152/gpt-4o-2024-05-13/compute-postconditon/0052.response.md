Postcondition: **`min_time`, `i`, `time_with_spell`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j` are integers. If the value at index `j` of array `d` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is set to the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and the value at index `j` of array `c`. Subsequently, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as the product of `remaining_potions` and the value at index `i` of array `a`. Finally, `min_time` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. If the condition is not met, the program breaks out of the loop.**
