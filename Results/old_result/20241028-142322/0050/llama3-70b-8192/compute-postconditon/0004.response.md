Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in descending order using the `sort(reverse=True)` method. Since the list `b` was already sorted in ascending order and is now sorted in descending order, the output state is: `n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input and it is sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input and it is sorted in descending order**
