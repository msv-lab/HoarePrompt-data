Example Answer:
If `shares` is greater than 0, `shares` will be set to 0, `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged, `i` is assigned the value of `m`, and `r` will be updated by adding `shares` multiplied by `b[i]`. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop will break. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged, `i` is assigned the value of `m`, `r` is updated by adding `shares` multiplied by `b[i]` or `r += shares * b[i]`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged, `i` is assigned the value of `m`, `r` is updated by adding `shares` multiplied by `b[i] or `r += shares * b[i]`**
