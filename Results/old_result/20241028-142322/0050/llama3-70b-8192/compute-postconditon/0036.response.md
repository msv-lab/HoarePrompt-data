Postcondition: **If `i` is less than 0, the loop will not start. If `shares` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged, `i` is assigned the value of `m`, and `r` will be updated by adding `shares` multiplied by `b[i]`. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop will break. If `shares` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged, `i` is assigned the value of `m`, and `r` is updated by adding `0`. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop will break.**

Precondition: variables can hold any values
Program fragment:
```
if x < 0:
    x = -x
    y -= x
```
Postcondition for if body: The integer `x` is updated to its negation. Integer `y` is decremented by the absolute value of `x`.
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **If `x` is less than 0, `x` is negated, and `y` is decremented by the absolute value of `x`. Otherwise, there is no change.**
