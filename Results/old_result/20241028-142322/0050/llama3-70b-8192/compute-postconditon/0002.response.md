Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the integers from the input split by spaces. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**
