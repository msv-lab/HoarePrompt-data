Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is updated by integer division of `r` divided by `s[i]`. The previous values of `shares`, `r`, and `s[i]` are unknown, so the output state is: `a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0, `shares` is updated.
Output State: **`a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0, `shares` is updated**
