Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` and returns the value of `x * y // gcd(x, y)`. However, the function does not handle cases where `x` or `y` is zero, which will cause a division by zero error. Additionally, the function does not import the `gcd` function from the `math` module, which is required for the computation.**
