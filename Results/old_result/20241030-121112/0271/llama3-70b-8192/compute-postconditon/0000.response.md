`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` (a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^9) is overwritten by the new input value, which can also be any integer. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
