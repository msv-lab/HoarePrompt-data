`result` is assigned the value `n - remainder`. Given that `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9, `result` will be an integer within the range of -9 to 10^9. 

The other variables, `n` and `remainder`, are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9, `result` is an integer within the range of -9 to 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9, `result` is an integer within the range of -9 to 10^9**
