`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Given that `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, the value of `remainder` will be an integer between 0 and 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9**
