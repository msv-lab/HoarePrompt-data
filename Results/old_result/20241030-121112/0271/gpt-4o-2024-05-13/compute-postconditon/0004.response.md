Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is `n - remainder` and is an integer within the range of -9 to 10^9. Otherwise, `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)` and is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^9.**
