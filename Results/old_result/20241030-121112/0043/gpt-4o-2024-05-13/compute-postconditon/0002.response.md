`n` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`, where `data[0]` is the first string in the list `data` and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial constraints ensure that `n` is already an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; for each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that |`x`|, |`y`| ≤ 10,000 and `x`^2 + `y`^2 > 0; `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`**
