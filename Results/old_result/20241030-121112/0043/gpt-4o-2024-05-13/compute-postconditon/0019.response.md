`angle` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`. The previous value of `angle` is overwritten with the new value computed by `math.atan2(y, x)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; for each vector, x and y are integers such that |x|, |y| ≤ 10,000 and x^2 + y^2 > 0; input is assigned the value sys.stdin.read; data is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; n is assigned the value of int(data[0]); vectors is a list containing a tuple (angle, i + 1) where angle is math.atan2(y, x) and i is n; i is less than or equal to 0; x is assigned the value of int(data[2 * i + 1]); y is assigned the value of int(data[2 * i + 2]); angle is assigned the value of math.atan2(y, x); vectors is updated to include the tuple (angle, i + 1); y is assigned the value of int(data[2 * i + 2]); `angle` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`**.
