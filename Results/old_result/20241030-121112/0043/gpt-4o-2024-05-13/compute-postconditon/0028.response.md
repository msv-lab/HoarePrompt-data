`angle_diff` is assigned the value `vectors[i][0] - vectors[i - 1][0]`, where `i` is 1. The previous values of the variables are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; for each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that |`x`|, |`y`| ≤ 10,000 and `x`^2 + `y`^2 > 0; `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`; `vectors` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `vectors` is sorted; `min_angle` is assigned the value `float('inf')`; `a` is -1; `b` is -1; `angle_diff` is assigned the value `vectors[1][0] - vectors[0][0]`.
