`xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`. Since `i` is less than 0, `vectors[i]` accesses the element at the negative index from the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` becomes less than 0, `j` becomes less than 0 + 1 which is less than 1, `xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`**
