`x` and `y` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string and converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial state of `x` and `y` as input integers is confirmed, so the output state remains unchanged for `n`, `vectors`, and `_`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000, `vectors` contains the tuple (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, variable `_` is less than 0**
