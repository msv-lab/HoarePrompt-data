`i` is assigned the value of `n`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **If `_` is negative initially, `vectors` will contain tuples (x, y) for each input pair until `_` becomes non-negative, and `_` will be non-negative. If `_` is 0 or positive initially, `vectors` will remain an empty list, and `_` will retain its initial value, `min_angle` is float('inf'), `ans` is (-1, -1), `i` is `n`**
