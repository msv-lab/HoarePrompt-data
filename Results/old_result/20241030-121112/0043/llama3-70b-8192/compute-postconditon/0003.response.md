`x` and `y` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string and converting them into integers. The previous values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `vectors` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers**
