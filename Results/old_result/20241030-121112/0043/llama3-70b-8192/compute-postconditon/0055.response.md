According to the provided `while` loop condition `i < 0`, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than 0.

At the end of the last iteration:
- If `j` starts at `n + 1` and is not less than `n`, the loop will not execute: `min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` becomes `n + 1`, and `j` remains `n + 1`.
- If `j` starts less than `n`, after execution: `min_angle` is either `float('inf')` or the smallest angle calculated, `ans` is either `(-1, -1)` or `(i + 1, j + 1)`, `i` becomes `n + 1`, and `j` will be incremented until it equals `n`.

In both scenarios, `i` becomes `n + 1` at the end of the iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to a value less than 0.

State: **`min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` becomes less than 0, `j` remains `n + 1` if it started as `n + 1`, otherwise `j` will be incremented until it equals `n`**
