min_angle is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The initial conditions for `_` and `vectors` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **If `_` is negative initially, `vectors` will contain tuples (x, y) for each input pair until `_` becomes non-negative, and `_` will be non-negative. If `_` is 0 or positive initially, `vectors` will remain an empty list, and `_` will retain its initial value, `min_angle` is float('inf').**
