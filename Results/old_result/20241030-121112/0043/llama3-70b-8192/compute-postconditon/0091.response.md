Output State: If `n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is the smallest angle computed between the vectors, `ans` is the pair of indices (1-based) corresponding to the vectors that form this angle, `j` is equal to `n`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, `min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `j` remains `0`, and `i` is increased by 1.
