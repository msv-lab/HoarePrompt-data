`i` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, `i + 1` is `k + 1 + 1` or `k + 2`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is (2^n - k) * (2^n - (k + 1)), `denominator` is 2^(2n), `i` is k + 2, `k` is less than -1**
