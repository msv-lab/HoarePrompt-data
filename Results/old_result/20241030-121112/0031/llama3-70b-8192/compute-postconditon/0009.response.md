`denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is `2^n`, and the value of `total_days` is `2^n`. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes `2^n * 2^n`, which is `2^(2n)`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is (2^n - k) * (2^n - (k + 1)), `denominator` is 2^(2n), `i` is k + 1, `k` is less than -1**
