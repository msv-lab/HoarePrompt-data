Postcondition: **Given that the loop cannot execute one more time due to constraints on `N`, if `decider` is 0 and `i < N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `alice_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0. Otherwise, `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. If `decider` is not 0 and `i < N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `bob_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. Otherwise, `alice_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0.**
