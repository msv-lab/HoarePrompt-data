The function func reads input from the standard input, which consists of an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers. It then processes these values by iterating through the list to distribute the integer slices between Alice and Bob based on certain conditions and prints their respective sums at the end. However, there are several issues with the function:

1. The while loop condition `while i < 0` will never execute as `i` is initialized to `N`, and `N` is always a positive integer.
2. The logic within the while loop is incorrectly structured; it does not properly alternate turns between Alice and Bob.
3. The function initializes `alice_sum` and `bob_sum` to 0 and prints them without any meaningful computation due to the loop not executing.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from standard input. It is intended to distribute the integers between Alice and Bob based on certain conditions and print their respective sums. However, the function contains logical errors that prevent it from executing as intended, such as an incorrect loop condition and flawed distribution logic. As a result, it will always print '0 0'. **
