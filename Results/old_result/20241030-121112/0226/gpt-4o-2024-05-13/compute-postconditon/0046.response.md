Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step:

1. The `while` loop condition is `i < 0`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < 0` must be true.

Now let's examine the program state at the end of the previous iteration:
- Variable `i` is less than `N` and increased by 1.
- There are several conditions involving `decider`, `i`, `slices[i]`, `alice_sum`, and `bob_sum`.

Given that the loop condition is `i < 0`, the only variable that directly affects whether the loop can execute again is `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, it is stated that `i` is less than `N` and increased by 1. However, this doesn't ensure that `i` is less than 0. We need to adjust `i` to be less than 0.

The program state that ensures the loop can execute one more time is:
State: **Variable `i` is less than 0 and increased by 1. If `decider` is 0 and `i` is less than `N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `alice_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `decider` is 0, `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. If `decider` is not 0 and `i` is less than `N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `decider` is not 0, `alice_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0.**
