`decider` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `variable i is less than -1, bob_sum is incremented by slices[i], decider is 1`.
Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]`, `decider` is 1**
