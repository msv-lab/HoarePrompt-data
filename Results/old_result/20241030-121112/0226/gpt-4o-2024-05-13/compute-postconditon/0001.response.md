`data` is assigned the value `input().split()`, where `input` accepts an input string and `split()` splits it into a list of strings. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `slices` is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and 100000, inclusive, and `data` is a list of input strings.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `slices` is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and 100000, inclusive, `data` is a list of input strings**
