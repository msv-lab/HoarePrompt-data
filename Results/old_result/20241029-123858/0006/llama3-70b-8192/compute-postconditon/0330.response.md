Postcondition: **`x` is decremented by `min(di, x)`. If `x` was greater than 0 after the decrement, `x` is further incremented by `hi`, resulting in `x` being (x - min(di, x)) + hi. If `x` was less than or equal to 0 after the decrement, `x` remains as (x - min(di, x)). `ans` is increased by 1 and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
