`_` is assigned the value of `t`, which is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The value of `t` is not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is assigned the value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is assigned the value of `t`**
