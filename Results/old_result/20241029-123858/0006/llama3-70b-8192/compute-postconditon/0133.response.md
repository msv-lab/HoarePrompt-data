`_` is increased by 1. The initial state specifies that `_` is an input integer increased by 2 where the input integer is less than -2. Therefore, the value of `_` before this increment is `input integer + 2`, and after the increment, it becomes `input integer + 3`.

Output State: **`_` is an input integer increased by 3 where the input integer is less than -2, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the input integer `di` appended, `h` contains the input integers `hi`, `hi`, and `hi` appended, `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input, `d` contains the input integer `di` appended again**
