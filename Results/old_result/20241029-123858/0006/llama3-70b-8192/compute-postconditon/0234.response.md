`di` and `hi` are assigned the next values from `iterator`, if available. However, now `di` and `hi` are reassigned the values obtained from `input`. Therefore, the Output State is: `di` and `hi` are input integers, other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed. `_` is `n` increased by 4 and is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `d` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list, `ans` is the number of iterations executed before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted or advanced by the number of pairs fetched, `di` and `hi` are input integers.**
