`x` is decremented by the smaller value between `di` and `x`. The exact values of `di` and `x` are unknown, so we can only describe the change in general terms.

Output State: **If `x` is greater than 0, the program continues executing the remaining code, and `x` is decreased by the smaller value between `di` and `x`.**
