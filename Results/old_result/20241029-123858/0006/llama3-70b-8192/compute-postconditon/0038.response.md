Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is greater than `di` after being decreased by `min(di, x)` and if `x` is greater than 0, it is increased by `hi`; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is 2; `iterator` is an iterator of zipped `d` and `h`; `di` is the next element from `d`; `hi` is the next element from `h` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
