`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `x` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)`. If `x` was greater than 0 after the decrement, `x` is further incremented by `hi`, resulting in `x` being (x - min(di, x)) + hi. If `x` was less than or equal to 0 after the decrement, `x` remains as (x - min(di, x)). `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is decremented by `min(di, x)`. If `x` was greater than 0 after the decrement, `x` is further incremented by `hi`, resulting in `x` being (x - min(di, x)) + hi. If `x` was less than or equal to 0 after the decrement, `x` remains as (x - min(di, x)). `ans` is increased by 1.**
