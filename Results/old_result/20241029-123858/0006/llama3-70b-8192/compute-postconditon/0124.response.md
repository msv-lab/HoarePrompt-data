According to the provided code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than `0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is an input integer increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `0`. This means the input integer (let's call it `input_int`) before being increased by 1 must be less than `-1` to ensure `_` is less than `0` after the increment.

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `d`, `h`, `di`, `hi`) do not influence the loop's condition directly.

State: **_ is an input integer increased by 1 where the input integer is less than -1, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers, `d` contains the input integer `di`, `h` contains the input integer `hi`, `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input**
