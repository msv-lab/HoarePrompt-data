`di` and `hi` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, which are split by a space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` is an empty list; `h` is an empty list; `di` and `hi` are input integers**
