`x` is increased by the value of `hi`. Since `hi` is the next element from `h` and `h` remains an empty list, `hi` does not have a specific value, therefore `x` is increased by an unknown value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is decreased by `min(di, x)` and increased by the next element from `h`; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is 0; `iterator` is an iterator of zipped `d` and `h`; `di` is the next element from `d`; `hi` is the next element from `h`**
