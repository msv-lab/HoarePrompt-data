Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the value after being decreased by the minimum of `di` and `x` and possibly increased by `hi` if `x` was greater than 0; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is the count of how many times the loop executed; `iterator` is an iterator of zipped `d` and `h`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the loop or the most internal if statement breaks. If `x` was initially less than or equal to 0, or if `d` or `h` are empty, the loop will not execute and all variables will remain as they were.**
