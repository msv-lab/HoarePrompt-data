Your task is to complete the overall postcondition for the given Hoare triple.

Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    a = a - b
elif a == b:
    return 0
else:
    a = a + b
    b = a - b

```
Postcondition for if body: The integer `a` is decreased by the integer `b`.
Postcondition for else body: If `a` equals `b`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the sum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is updated to the original value of `a`.
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is decreased by `b`. If `a` equals `b`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the sum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is updated to the original value of `a`.**
