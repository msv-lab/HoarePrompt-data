`x` is increased by the value of `hi`. The initial state specifies that `x` is decreased by the smaller value between `di` and `x` if `x` is greater than 0, but this does not affect the current code snippet.

Output State: **If `x` is greater than 0, the program continues executing the remaining code, and `x` is decreased by the smaller value between `di` and `x`. `x` is increased by the value of `hi`.**
