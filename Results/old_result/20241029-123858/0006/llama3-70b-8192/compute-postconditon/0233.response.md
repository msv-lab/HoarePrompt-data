Output State: **If `x` is positive, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed. `_` is `n` increased by 4 and is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `d` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list, `ans` is the number of iterations executed before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted or advanced by the number of pairs fetched, `di` and `hi` are the next values from `iterator`, if available, `x` is less than or equal to 0, or the iterator has been exhausted. If `x` is 0 or negative initially, `ans` remains 0 and `iterator` is exhausted. If the iterator is exhausted before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0, `x` remains positive, `n` is an input integer, `_` is assigned the value of `n`.**
