`di` and `hi` are assigned the values resulting from splitting the input string and converting them to integers. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, -1 is printed if `x` is positive, otherwise `ans` is printed. `_` is `n` increased by 4, incremented by 2, and is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` is less than -6, `x` is an input integer, `d` is a list containing `di` appended to the original `d`, `h` contains `hi`, `ans` is the number of iterations executed before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted or advanced by the number of pairs fetched, `di` and `hi` are input integers, `h` contains `hi` appended, `di` is an input integer, `hi` is an input integer.**
