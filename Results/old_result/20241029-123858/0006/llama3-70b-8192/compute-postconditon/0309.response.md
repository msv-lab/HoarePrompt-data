According to the given `while True` loop, the loop will execute indefinitely unless an explicit break condition occurs inside the loop body. Since the loop condition `while True` will always be true, the loop is guaranteed to execute again as long as there is no external break caused by a condition such as `x` being less than or equal to 0, or an exception like `StopIteration`.

However, we need to ensure that the program state allows for the loop to continue based on the given conditions within the loop body. Let's break down the conditions:

1. `_` needs to be incremented until it is no longer less than 0 initially.
2. `d` and `h` are populated with pairs of `di` and `hi` from input until `_` becomes 0 or greater.
3. Once `_` is not less than 0, the state depends on the values of `d`, `h`, `x`, and the iterator over `d` and `h`.
4. The loop terminates when `x` is less than or equal to 0 or when a `StopIteration` exception occurs.

Given this information, the loop will continue to run as long as `x` is greater than 0 and there are more pairs of `d` and `h` to iterate over without causing a `StopIteration` exception.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `_` was initially less than 0, we need to ensure `_` is still being incremented until it reaches 0 or greater.
- If `_` is not less than 0 initially:
  - `d` and `h` should remain as lists of pairs of `di` and `hi`.
  - `ans` should reflect the number of successful iterations where `x` remained positive.
  - The iterator over pairs of `d` and `h` should continue to provide the next values for `di` and `hi`.
  - `x` should be adjusted based on the minimum of `di` and `x`, and increased by `hi` if still positive.
  - Ensure `x` remains greater than 0 to avoid breaking the loop.

Since the loop is `while True`, we can assume it will execute again unless explicitly broken by the conditions outlined.

**Final State:**
State: **If `_` is less than 0 initially, `_` is incremented by 1 each iteration until it is 0 or greater, `d` and `h` contain pairs of `di` and `hi` from input. If `_` is not less than 0 initially, `d` and `h` remain lists of pairs of `di` and `hi`, `ans` is the count of successful iterations, iterator provides next `di` and `hi`, `x` is adjusted by the minimum of `di` and `x` and increased by `hi` if positive, and x remains greater than 0, no StopIteration exception occurs.**
