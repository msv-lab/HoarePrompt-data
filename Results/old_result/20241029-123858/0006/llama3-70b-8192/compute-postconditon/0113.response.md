Precondition: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if a < b:
    a = b
elif a == b:
    b = 0
else:
    a = a - b

```
Postcondition for if body: If `a` < `b`, `a` is updated to the value of `b`.
Postcondition for else body: If `a` == `b`, `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by the value of `b`.
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is less than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value of `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by the value of `b`.**
