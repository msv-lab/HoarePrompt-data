`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `t` is initially an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, the output state is `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
