The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_` is unknown. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 
Output State: **variable `_` is increased by 1; `a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is less than `b`, then `a` is updated to the value of `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by the value of `b`.**
