In the provided example, there is a logical error. The precondition states that the variable `ans` is increased by 1, but the program fragment does not mention `ans` at all. Instead, it shows a condition checking `x <= 0` followed by a `break` statement. This discrepancy needs to be corrected in the precondition.

Let's correct the given example and then proceed with your task.

Corrected Example:
Precondition: `x` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if x <= 0:
    break

```
Postcondition for if body: We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`x` is an integer. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues.**

Now, let's proceed with your task. Please provide the precondition and program fragment for which I need to create the postconditions.
