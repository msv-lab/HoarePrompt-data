`di` and `hi` are assigned the values obtained from calling `next(iterator)`. The values of `di` and `hi` depend on the next item from the iterator, which is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `di` and `hi` are the next values from `iterator`.

Output State: **`di` and `hi` are the next values from `iterator`**
