You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the conditions in the program fragment. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts, and if there is an elif part, it will be described in the else postcondition. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. If the program fragment contains nested if statements, you only need to focus on the outermost condition, as the postconditions for the nested if statements are included in the if postcondition and else postcondition.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the boundary values of the different cases. Make sure to include these potential cases in the postcondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
    return None

```
Postcondition for if body: the function returns None
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None**
Precondition: variables can hold any values
Program fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    return n
else:
    return int(n)

```
Postcondition for if body: The function returns `n`
Postcondition for else body: The function returns `int(n)`
Postcondition: **if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`**
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program fragment:
```
if x < 2:
    return False
else:
    return True

```
Postcondition for if body: The function return False
Postcondition for else body: The function return True
Postcondition: **x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True**
Precondition: `m` is integer, `n` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    n = -n
    m += 1
elif n == 0:
    return m
else:
    n -= 13
    m += 1

```
Postcondition for if body: the integer `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
Postcondition for else body: If integer `n` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, `n` has been decreased by 13 and integer `m` is increased by 1.
Postcondition: **`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.**
Precondition: x is an integer, y is zero.
Program fragment:
```
if x > 0:
    if x > 10:
        y = x * 2
    else:
        y = x + 5

```
Postcondition for if body: `x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 10, then `y` is set to twice the value of x. If `x` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, then `y` is set to the value of x plus 5.**
Precondition: If `x` is initially less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `d`, `h`, `ans`, and `iterator` remain in their initial state, with `iterator` retaining all its elements. If `d` or `h` are empty, the loop does not execute and all variables remain unchanged. If `x` is initially positive, the loop executes until `x` becomes less than or equal to 0. In this case, `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)` and possibly incremented by `hi` if `x` remains positive. `ans` is incremented by the number of iterations until `x` becomes less than or equal to 0. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `d`, `h`, `iterator`) retain their respective states, with `iterator` progressing to its next elements. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or control structure, and the state of the variables from that point is undefined.
Program fragment:
```
if x > 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(ans)

```
Postcondition for if body: If `x` is initially less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `d`, `h`, `ans`, and `iterator` remain in their initial state, with `iterator` retaining all its elements. If `d` or `h` are empty, the loop does not execute and all variables remain unchanged. If `x` is initially positive, the loop executes until `x` becomes less than or equal to 0. In this case, `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)` and possibly incremented by `hi` if `x` remains positive. `ans` is incremented by the number of iterations until `x` becomes less than or equal to 0. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `d`, `h`, `iterator`) retain their respective states, with `iterator` progressing to its next elements. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or control structure, and the state of the variables from that point is undefined. The program prints -1.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is initially less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `d`, `h`, `ans`, and `iterator` remain in their initial state, with `iterator` retaining all its elements. If `d` or `h` are empty, the loop does not execute and all variables remain unchanged. If `x` is initially positive, the loop executes until `x` becomes less than or equal to 0. In this case, `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)` and possibly incremented by `hi` if `x` remains positive. `ans` is incremented by the number of iterations until `x` becomes less than or equal to 0. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `d`, `h`, `iterator`) retain their respective states, with `iterator` progressing to its next elements. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or control structure, and the state of the variables from that point is undefined, and `ans` is printed.
