The `StopIteration` exception can be raised at the `d, h = next(iterator)` line, indicating that the iterator has no more elements to yield. If no exception is raised, the program state is updated based on the conditions within the `try` block.

Here's the detailed breakdown:

- If `d >= x`, the function appends `1` to `results` and breaks out of the loop.
- The `max_single_blow` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `d`.
- If `d > h`, the `max_effective_blow` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.

In case of `StopIteration`:

- The loop is exited via a `break` statement.

Combining the above scenarios:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9. `results` is a list that may contain 1 if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple. `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the program breaks out of the loop. During the loop, if `d >= x`, 1 is appended to `results` and the loop is broken. Otherwise, `max_single_blow` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `d`, and if `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.**
