Precondition: `a` and `b` are integers, and `c` is a boolean
Program fragment:
```
if c:
    a = b
else:
    b = a + 1

```
Postcondition for if body: `a` is set to the value of `b`
Postcondition for else body: `b` is set to the value of `a + 1`
Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers, and `c` is a boolean. If `c` is True, `a` is set to the value of `b`. Otherwise, `b` is set to the value of `a + 1`.**
