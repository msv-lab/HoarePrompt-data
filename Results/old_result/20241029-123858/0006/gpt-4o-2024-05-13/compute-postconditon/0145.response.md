According to the `while` loop condition, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `_`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `_` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must still be less than 0 after being incremented.

Thus, we need to ensure that `_` was less than -1 before the increment, making it less than 0 after the increment.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 7, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is a list containing a tuple with the values `(d, h)` and another tuple with the values `(d, h)`, `d` is `int(data[5])`, `h` is `int(data[6])`, variable `_` was less than -1 before increment**
