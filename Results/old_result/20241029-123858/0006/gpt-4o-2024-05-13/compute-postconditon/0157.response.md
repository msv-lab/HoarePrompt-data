blows is assigned an empty list `[]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` is less than 0, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 5, `n` is `int(data[3])`, `x` is `int(data[4])`, `blows` is an empty list.
