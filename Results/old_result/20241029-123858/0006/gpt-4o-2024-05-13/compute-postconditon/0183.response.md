`blows` is an empty list, and the code appends the tuple `(d, h)` to it. `d` is `int(data[7])` and `h` is `int(data[8])`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is `int(data[5])`, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows), ((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is `7`, `n` is `int(data[5])`, `x` is `int(data[6])`, `blows` is `[(int(data[7]), int(data[8]))]`, `int(data[3])` is less than -1, `d` is `int(data[7])`, `h` is `int(data[8])`**
