`d` and `h` are assigned the values `int(data[index])` and `int(data[index + 1])`, respectively, where `index` is 5. Therefore, `d` is `int(data[5])` and `h` is `int(data[6])`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is `int(data[3])`, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 5, `n` is `int(data[3])`, `x` is `int(data[4])`, `blows` is an empty list, `d` is `int(data[5])`, `h` is `int(data[6])`**
