The `StopIteration` exception can occur at the statement `d, h = next(iterator)` if the iterator has no more elements to yield.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`.
   - `results` is its previous values plus 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`.
   - `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_single_blow` and `d`.
   - `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`.
   - `query` is the next element from `iterator`.
   - `n` is the first element of the tuple `query[0]`.
   - `x` is the second element of the tuple `query[0]`.
   - `blows` is assigned the value `query[1:]`.
   - `d` and `h` are the first and second elements of the next tuple from the iterator over `blows`.

2. **Execution of `try` block**:
   - `d, h = next(iterator)`: Assigns `d` and `h` from the next tuple in `blows`. This could raise a `StopIteration` exception if `iterator` has no more elements.
   - `if d >= x`: Checks if `d` is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - If true, `results.append(1)` is executed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `max_single_blow = max(max_single_blow, d)`: Updates `max_single_blow` to the maximum between its current value and `d`.
   - `if d > h`: Checks if `d` is greater than `h`.
     - If true, `max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)` updates `max_effective_blow` to the maximum between its current value and `d - h`.

3. **Execution of `except` block**:
   - `except StopIteration`: This block is executed if `StopIteration` is raised.
     - `break`: Breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Combined Program State:
- If the iterator has more elements, `d` and `h` are assigned from the next tuple.
  - If `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` is updated with an additional 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
  - `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `d`.
  - If `d` is greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `d - h`.
- If the iterator has no more elements, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, `results` is its previous values plus 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`, `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_single_blow` and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` if `d` is greater than `h`, `query` is the next element from `iterator`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `query[0]`, `x` is the second element of the tuple `query[0]`, `blows` is assigned the value `query[1:]`, `d` and `h` are the first and second elements of the next tuple from the iterator over `blows`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` is updated with an additional 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the iterator has no more items, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d` is greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`.**
