`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, and `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. `index` is 1, so `n` becomes `int(data[1])`, and `x` becomes `int(data[2])`. The values of `t`, `queries`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 1, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`**
