Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list `queries` of `t` tuples. Each tuple contains a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`. The function returns a list `results`, where each entry corresponds to each query's result. For each query, the function checks if any `d_i` is greater than or equal to `x` and appends `1` to `results` if true. If not, it calculates the maximum single blow (`max_single_blow`) and the maximum effective blow (`max_effective_blow`). If `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `-1` to `results`. Otherwise, it calculates and appends the number of additional blows required to reach `x` based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`. Edge cases include when `queries` is empty, resulting in an empty `results` list, and when all `d_i` values are less than `x` with `max_effective_blow` non-positive, leading to `-1` in `results`. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where `d_i` or `h_i` values might be negative, which could affect the correctness of the calculation.**
