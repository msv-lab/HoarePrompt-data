Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple (n, x) and a list of `n` tuples (d_i, h_i), where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9, `results` is the original list with 1 appended if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`, `d` and `h` are the first `d_i` and `h_i` values from `iterator`, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value between the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`. If `d` is greater than `h`, then `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
