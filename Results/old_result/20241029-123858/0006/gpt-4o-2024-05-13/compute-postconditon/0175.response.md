`queries` is a list, and the code `queries.append(((n, x), blows))` appends a tuple `((n, x), blows)` to `queries`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `blows` are already provided, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`_` is `int(data[3])`, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows), ((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is `5`, `n` is `int(data[3])`, `x` is `int(data[4])`, `blows` is an empty list**
