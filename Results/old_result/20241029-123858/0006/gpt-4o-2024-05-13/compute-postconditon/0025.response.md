The `break` statement does not modify any variables; it simply causes an exit from the most internal loop or if statement. Since the state of any variables before the `break` statement is unknown and no variable is modified by the `break` statement, the output state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
