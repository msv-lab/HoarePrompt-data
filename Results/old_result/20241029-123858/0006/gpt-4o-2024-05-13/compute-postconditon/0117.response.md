Given the `while True` loop, it inherently continues indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one more time based on the provided state without needing to adjust any variables.

In this case, we should simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`. `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0. `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_single_blow` and `d`. If `d` is greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`. If the iterator is exhausted (raising `StopIteration`), the loop breaks.**
