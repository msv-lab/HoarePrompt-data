d, h are assigned the values int(data[index]) and int(data[index + 1]) respectively. Given that index is 7, d will be int(data[7]) and h will be int(data[8]). Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **_ is int(data[3]) + 1, t is an integer converted from data[0], queries is [((n, x), blows)], results is a list, index is 7, n is int(data[3]), x is int(data[4]), blows is [(int(data[5]), int(data[6)))], d is int(data[7]), h is int(data[8]), and int(data[3]) is less than -1**
