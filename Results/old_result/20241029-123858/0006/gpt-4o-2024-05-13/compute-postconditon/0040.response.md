The program could raise a `StopIteration` exception at several points in the code:

1. When attempting to get the next element from the `iterator` initially with `query = next(iterator)`.
2. When attempting to get the next element inside the `while` loop with `d, h = next(iterator)`.

If `StopIteration` is raised:
- Initially, it will break out of the outer `try` block, which would terminate the program's execution.
- Inside the `while` loop, it will break out of the loop and continue to the `else` block.

The internal `try` block within the `while` loop handles the `StopIteration` to break out of the loop and proceed to the `else` block, which then appends either `-1` or a calculated value to `results`.

### Final Program State:

**Initial State**:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `iterator` is an iterator over the list `queries`.

**Program state after executing the `try` statement**:
- If `StopIteration` is raised during `query = next(iterator)`, the loop breaks, and the state is terminated.
- Otherwise, the program processes each query:
  - `query` becomes the next element of `iterator`.
  - `n` and `x` are unpacked from the first element of `query`.
  - `blows` is the list of tuples `(d_i, h_i)`.
  - `max_single_blow` is initialized to 0.
  - `max_effective_blow` is initialized to `float('-inf')`.
  - `iterator` becomes an iterator over `blows`.
  - For each `(d, h)` in `blows`:
    - If `d >= x`, 1 is appended to `results`, and the loop breaks.
    - `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d`.
    - If `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.
  - If `StopIteration` is raised inside the `while` loop, the loop breaks, and the `else` block is executed:
    - If `max_effective_blow <= 0`, append `-1` to `results`.
    - Otherwise, calculate `remaining_heads` and `additional_blows`, and append the result to `results`.

**Edge Cases**:
1. If `StopIteration` is raised immediately, the program terminates early.
2. If all `d_i` are less than `x` and no `d_i - h_i` is positive, append `-1` to `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9. `results` is a list that contains 1 if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple in `blows`, otherwise `results` contains -1 if `max_effective_blow <= 0`, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`. `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop exits. `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d`, and `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d - h` if `d > h`. If `d >= x`, the loop breaks and appends 1 to `results`.**
