Postcondition: **`pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`. `max_pleased`, `min_price`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `friends` is empty, `pleased` is 0. The loop terminates when `iterator` is exhausted. If the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is set to this sum, and `ans` is set to `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**
