According to the problem specifications, we have a `while True` loop, which means that the loop can certainly execute one more time without any additional conditions. Therefore, we simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration since no adjustments are necessary to allow the loop to proceed.

State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`. If `f` is a subset of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is increased by 1 and becomes either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, the value of `pleased` remains unchanged and is either 0, 1, or 2. If a `StopIteration` exception is raised, the state is unknown and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
