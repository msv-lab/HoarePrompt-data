Output State: **`max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` reflect the best found values according to the criteria during the iterations, `i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from the iterator. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `pleased` is increased by 1. If a `StopIteration` exception is raised, the loop breaks.**
