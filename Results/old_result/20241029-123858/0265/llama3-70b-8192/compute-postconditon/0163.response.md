Postcondition: **If `pleased` equals `max_pleased`, and if the sum of the prices of `pizzas[i]` and `pizzas[j]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to this sum, and `ans` is updated to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. This occurs under the condition that `i` is less than -1 and `j` is less than 0. These updates are contingent on the integrity of data structures, assuming no exceptions such as `TypeError` are raised due to malformed inputs.**
