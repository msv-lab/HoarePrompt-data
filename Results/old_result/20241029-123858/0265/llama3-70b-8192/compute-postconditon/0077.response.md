Since this is a `while True` loop, the loop will always be able to execute one more time, barring any external conditions or exceptions that may cause it to break out of the loop. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states explicitly for the loop to proceed to the next iteration. You only need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`pleased` is 0 initially, `max_pleased`, `min_price`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged, `iterator` is assigned the iterator of `friends`. If `iterator` has more elements, `f` is the next element of `iterator`, and if `f` is a subset of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `pleased` is incremented by 1. If the `iterator` is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
