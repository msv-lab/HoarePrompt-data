Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `f` is a subset of `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is increased by 1, making it either 1 or 2.**
