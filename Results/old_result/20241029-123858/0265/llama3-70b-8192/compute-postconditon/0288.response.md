Output State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 1, `pleased` is incremented by the number of `f` subsets found in either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]` before the `iterator` is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted causing `StopIteration` to break the loop. If `friends` is empty, `pleased` remains 0. The loop will always start but will end when `iterator` is exhausted, `min_price` is the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]`**
