Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than or equal to 0, `iterator` is reset to a new iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from `iterator`, `pleased` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `m` is greater than 0. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `pleased` is incremented by 1.**
