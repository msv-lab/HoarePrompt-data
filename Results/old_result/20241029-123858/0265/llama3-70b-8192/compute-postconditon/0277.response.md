Given the nature of the `while True` loop, it will always execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, the program state at the end of the previous iteration can simply be repeated, as the loop is guaranteed to execute again.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 1, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is a new iterator created from `friends`, `j` is less than `m`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is incremented by 1. If `StopIteration` is raised, the state is unknown and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
