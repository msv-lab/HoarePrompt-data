`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, where `input` accepts a line of input and `split` splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers by `map(int, ... )`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^5**
