Given that the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state of the variables. Hence, the program state at the end of the previous iteration can simply be repeated.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, and `f` is the next value from `iterator`**
