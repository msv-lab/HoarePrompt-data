A `StopIteration` exception could be raised when `next(iterator)` is called and there are no more items left in the iterator. If this exception is raised, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. Otherwise, the program continues to check if `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]` and increments `pleased` if it is.

Output State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`. If there are no more items in the iterator, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is incremented by 1, otherwise, `pleased` remains unchanged.**
