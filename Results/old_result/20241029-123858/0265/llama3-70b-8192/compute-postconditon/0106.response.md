The `break` statement is used to exit from the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. Since the initial state is unknown, we cannot determine the exact values of any variables, but we know that the `break` statement will cause an exit from the loop or if statement.

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
