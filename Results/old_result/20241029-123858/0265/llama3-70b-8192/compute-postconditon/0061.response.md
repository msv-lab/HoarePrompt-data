`min_price` is assigned the value of `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`. The values of `i` and `j` are unknown, as well as the structure and values of the `pizzas` list. Therefore, `min_price` is the result of `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`pleased` is a variable holding a specific integer value, `max_pleased` is assigned the value of `pleased`, `min_price` is `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`**
