Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is equal to the count of items in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, and `iterator` is exhausted. If `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to the sum of `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` and `ans` is set to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, where `ans` is a tuple with values less than 0 and less than 1.**
