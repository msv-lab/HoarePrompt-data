Given that the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, for the next iteration to proceed, the states at the end of the previous iteration should be repeated.

State: **`pleased` is 0 initially, `max_pleased`, `min_price`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. `iterator` is assigned the iterator of `friends`. If `iterator` has more elements, `f` is the next element of `iterator`; otherwise, `StopIteration` is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional block. If `f` is a subset of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `pleased` is incremented by 1.**
