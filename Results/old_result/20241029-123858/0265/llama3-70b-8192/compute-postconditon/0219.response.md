max_pleased is assigned the value of pleased. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `iterator` is exhausted, `max_pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `iterator` is exhausted, `max_pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`**
