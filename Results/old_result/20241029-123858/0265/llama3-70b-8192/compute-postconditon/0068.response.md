`j` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If `pleased` is greater than `max_pleased`, then `max_pleased` is updated to the value of `pleased`, `min_price` is set to the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` is updated to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If `pleased` is equal to `max_pleased` and the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to this sum and `ans` is set to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, if `pleased` is equal to `max_pleased` but the sum of `pizzas[i][0]` and `pizzas[j][0]` is not less than `min_price`, then `min_price` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `pleased` is not equal to `max_pleased`, the state remains unchanged. `j` is increased by 1.
