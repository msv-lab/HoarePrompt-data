`ans` is assigned the tuple value `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given that `i` is less than -1 and `j` is less than 0, `i + 1` is less than 0 and `j + 1` is less than 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_pleased` is assigned the value of `pleased`, `min_price` is assigned the value of `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`, `ans` is a tuple with values less than 0 and less than 1, `i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the last element successfully retrieved from the iterator (if any), `pleased` is increased by 1 for each `f` that is a subset of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`.**
