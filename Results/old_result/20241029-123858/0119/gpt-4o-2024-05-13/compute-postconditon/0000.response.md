`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and each segment is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and each segment is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and each segment is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9.**
