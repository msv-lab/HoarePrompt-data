`l` and `r` are assigned the values of the input integers after being split by a space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous state of `n` and `segments` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `segments` contains one tuple (l, r, i + 1), `i` is less than 0, `l` and `r` are input integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, `l` and `r` are input integers.
