max_index is assigned the value -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: segments remains an empty list, i remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), l and r are not assigned any values, max_right is -1, max_index is -1.

Output State: **segments remains an empty list, i remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), l and r are not assigned any values, max_right is -1, max_index is -1**
