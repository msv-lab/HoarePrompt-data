`l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers using `map`. The previous state of `l` and `r` is not retained after the assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `segments` contains two tuples (l, r, i + 1), `i` is less than or equal to 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `segments` contains two tuples (l, r, i + 1), `i` is less than or equal to 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
