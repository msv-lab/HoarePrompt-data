Postcondition: **segments remain an empty list, `i` remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), `l`, `r`, and `index` are assigned the next values from `iterator`, `max_right` is updated to `r`, and `max_index` is updated to `index`. If `r` is less than or equal to `max_right`, the function prints `index` and `max_index`, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
