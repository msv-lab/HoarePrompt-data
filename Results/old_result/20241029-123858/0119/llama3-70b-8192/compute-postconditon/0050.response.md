`j` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **The loop cannot execute again with the given constraints and initial state. If `i` is not equal to `j` and `segments[i][0]` is greater than or equal to `segments[j][0]` and `segments[i][1]` is less than or equal to `segments[j][1]`, then `i + 1` and `j + 1` are printed, and the program exits, `j` is incremented by 1.**
