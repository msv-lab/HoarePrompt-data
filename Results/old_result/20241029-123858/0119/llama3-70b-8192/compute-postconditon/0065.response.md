According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is increased by 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `b` can be zero. If `b` is zero, the function returns "Division by zero". Otherwise, the function returns the result of `a` divided by `b`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `j` is still less than 0 after being increased by 1.

Let's infer the previous value of `j`:
- Since `j` is increased by 1 at the end of the iteration, for it to be less than 0, the previous value of `j` must have been `-1` or less.

Therefore, no specific changes to `a` and `b` are necessary for the loop to continue, as they do not influence the condition `j < 0`.

State: **variable `j` is increased by 1 and `j` is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, and `b` can be zero**
