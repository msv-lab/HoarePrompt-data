The following provides the initial state of the loop and the loop's code.
Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is assigned the value of `n`.
```
while i < 0:
    j = n
    while j < 0:
        if i != j and segments[i][0] >= segments[j][0] and segments[i][1
            ] <= segments[j][1]:
            print(i + 1, j + 1)
            exit()
        j += 1
    i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling especially those concerning the values that cause the loop to end or not to start in the first place. Make sure to include these potential cases in the output state.
Use the format Output State: **the output state you calculate**

Answer:
Given the conditions in the initial state, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5).
2. `segments` is an empty list.
3. `_` is assigned the value of `n`.
4. `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

The outer loop's condition is `while i < 0:`. Given that `i` is initially assigned the value of `n`, which is always a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5), the condition `i < 0` will never be satisfied.

As a result, the outer loop will never execute, and none of the code inside the loop will be run.

### Missing Logic and Edge Cases:
- The loop condition `i < 0` will never be true for the given constraints, so the code inside the loop will never execute.
- There is no handling for the case where `segments` might be non-empty, but given the initial state, it is always empty.
- No changes will occur to any variables because the loops will not be entered.

Output State: **`n` remains the same positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5); `segments` remains an empty list; `_` remains the same value as `n`; `i` remains the same value as `n`; `j` is not initialized since the loops do not execute. The loops do not execute because the condition `i < 0` is never satisfied.**
