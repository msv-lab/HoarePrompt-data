`print` prints the current values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. The program does not specify the values of `i` and `j`, so their values are unknown. The loop cannot execute again according to the given constraints and initial state, meaning the program will terminate after this print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: the loop cannot execute again with the given constraints and initial state, `i + 1` and `j + 1` are printed.

Output State: **the loop cannot execute again with the given constraints and initial state, `i + 1` and `j + 1` are printed**
