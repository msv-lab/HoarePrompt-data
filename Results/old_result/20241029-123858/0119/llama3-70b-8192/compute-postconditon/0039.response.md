Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is -1; `j` is assigned the value of `n`. If `i` is not equal to `j`, and `segments[i][0]` is greater than or equal to `segments[j][0]`, and `segments[i][1]` is less than or equal to `segments[j][1]`, the function prints `0 n + 1` and the program exits.**
