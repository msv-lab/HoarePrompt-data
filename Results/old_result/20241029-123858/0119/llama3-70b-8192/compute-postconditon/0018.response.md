`i` and `j` are assigned the value of `n`. The code prints the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Since `i` and `j` are both `n`, the printed values will be `n + 1` and `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` is an empty list; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `i` is assigned the value of `n`; `j` is assigned the value of `n`, and the program prints `n + 1` and `n + 1`**
