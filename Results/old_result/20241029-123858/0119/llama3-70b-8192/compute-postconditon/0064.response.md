The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Other variables `a` and `b` are not affected. 

Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1; `a` and `b` are integers, and `b` can be zero. If `b` is zero, the function returns "Division by zero". Otherwise, the function returns the result of `a` divided by `b`.**
