`l` and `r` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`); `_` is less than 0; `l` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer**
