According to the code and the provided states, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `total_squares` and its relationship to `x`. If `total_squares` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again.

Let's break down the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` has increased by 1.
- `m` is 3.
- `total_squares` is calculated using the expression `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n) + (n - 3 + 1) * (3 - n + 1)`.
- `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x` and `n < int(x)`.
- If `total_squares` equals `x`, `(n, m)` is appended to `results` and the loop or block is exited.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `total_squares` is less than `x`.

Given that `total_squares` is already less than `x` and `n` is less than `int(x)`, we don't need to adjust `x`. However, we need to ensure that `total_squares` remains less than `x` after potentially increasing `n` by 1 again for the next iteration.

Since the conditions are already set to allow another iteration (`total_squares < x` and `n < int(x)`), we can state that the loop can execute one more time without needing any adjustments.

State: **`n` has increased by 1, `m` is 3, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n) + (n - 3 + 1) * (3 - n + 1)`, `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`**
