`print(n, m)` outputs the values of `n` and `m`. Since `n` and `m` are updated to the next values from `iterator`, they will have specific values, and the values of `n` and `m` will be printed. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the next values from `iterator`, `iterator` has more values to yield, and `n` and `m` are printed**
