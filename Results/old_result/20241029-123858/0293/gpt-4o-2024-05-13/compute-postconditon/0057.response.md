`total_squares` is assigned the value `total_squares + (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`. The initial value of `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`. Calculating it would give `(n * (2 - n)) + (n - 2 + 1) * (2 - n + 1)`. Simplifying this further:

- Initial `total_squares` = `n * (2 - n)`
- New term to add = `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)` = `(n - 2 + 1) * (2 - n + 1)` = `(n - 1) * (3 - n)`

The final value of `total_squares` is therefore `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n)`.

Output State: **`n` has increased by 1, `m` is 2, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n)`, `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`, results remains unchanged unless `total_squares` equals `x`**.
