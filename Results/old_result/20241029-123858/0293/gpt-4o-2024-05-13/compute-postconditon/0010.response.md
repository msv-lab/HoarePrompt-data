`m` is incremented by 1. Initially, `m` is 1, so after incrementing, `m` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 2, `total_squares` is 1**
