The `break` statement causes the immediate termination of the innermost enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since the initial state of the variables is unknown and the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the output state will reflect that the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
