After analyzing the given loop and its initial state, the following output state can be determined by considering the provided iterations and potential edge cases:

1. **Loop executes 1 time:**

Initial State: If `total_squares` reaches `x` during any iteration, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and the inner loop terminates. If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without equaling `x`, the inner loop terminates without modifying `results`. After the inner and outer loops, `n` is incremented to a value where `n` is less than `int(x`, and then `len(results)` is printed; `iterator` is an iterator over the sorted `results`.

```python
try:
    n, m = next(iterator)
    print(n, m)
except StopIteration:
    break
```

Output State: **If `iterator` has more items, `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and they are printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the loop.**

2. **Loop executes 2 times:**

Initial State: If `total_squares` reaches `x` during any iteration, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and the inner loop terminates. If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without equaling `x`, the inner loop terminates without modifying `results`. After the inner and outer loops, `n` is incremented to a value where `n` is less than `int(x`, and then `len(results)` is printed; `iterator` is an iterator over the sorted `results`. If `iterator` has more items, `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and `n` and `m` are printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

```python
try:
    n, m = next(iterator)
    print(n, m)
except StopIteration:
    break
```

Output State: **If `iterator` has more items, `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and they are printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the loop.**

3. **Loop executes 3 times:**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and `iterator` has more values to yield

```python
try:
    n, m = next(iterator)
    print(n, m)
except StopIteration:
    break
```

Output State: **If `iterator` has more items, `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and they are printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the loop.**

Final Output State considering all edge cases:
- If `iterator` has items, the loop will continue until `iterator` is exhausted, updating `n` and `m` and printing them on each iteration.
- If `iterator` is exhausted at any point, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the loop breaks.
- If `iterator` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and the program will immediately break out of the loop.

Output State: **If `iterator` has items, the loop will continue updating and printing `n` and `m` until `iterator` is exhausted. If `iterator` is exhausted at any point, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the loop breaks. If `iterator` is initially empty, the loop will not execute, and the program will immediately break out of the loop.**
