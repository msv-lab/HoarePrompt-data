`m` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 0.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 0**
