`results` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming it exists as a list, the code appends the tuple `(n, m)` to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` has increased by 1, `m` is 3, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n) + (n - 3 + 1) * (3 - n + 1)`, `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`, `results` has `(n, m)` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` has increased by 1, `m` is 3, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n) + (n - 3 + 1) * (3 - n + 1)`, `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`, `results` has `(n, m)` appended to it**
