To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided code and state step by step:

1. **Condition Check**: The loop condition is `while total_squares < x`. For the loop to execute again, `total_squares` must be less than `x`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` has increased by 1.
   - `m` is 2.
   - `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n)`.
   - `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`.
   - If `total_squares` equals `x`, `results` is appended with `(n, m)` and the loop or if statement is broken.

3. **State Analysis**:
   - `n` has increased by 1, so it can be represented as `n = previous_n + 1`.
   - `m` is fixed at 2.
   - `total_squares` is given by the formula `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n)`.

4. **Condition Satisfaction**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `total_squares` must be less than `x`.
   - The state already specifies that `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`.
   - This means `x` is already set appropriately to allow the loop to continue as long as the condition `total_squares < x` is satisfied.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration already ensures that `total_squares < x` and `n < int(x)`, we can repeat the same state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` has increased by 1, `m` is 2, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n)`, `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`**
