Given that the loop is a `while True` loop, the program will always try to execute the next iteration unless an explicit break statement or some other exit condition is encountered inside the loop. Because of this, there is no need to modify any state to ensure that the loop can execute again. The program state remains the same at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **If `total_squares` reaches `x` during any iteration, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and the inner loop terminates. If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without equaling `x`, the inner loop terminates without modifying `results`. After the inner and outer loops, `n` is incremented to a value where `n` is less than `int(x`, and then `len(results)` is printed; `iterator` is an iterator over the sorted `results`. If `iterator` has more items, `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and `n` and `m` are printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
