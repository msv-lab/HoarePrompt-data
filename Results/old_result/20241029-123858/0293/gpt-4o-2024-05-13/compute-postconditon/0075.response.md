Output State: **If `total_squares` reaches `x` during any iteration, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and the inner loop terminates. If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without equaling `x`, the inner loop terminates without modifying `results`. After the inner and outer loops, `n` is incremented to a value where `n` is less than `int(x`, and then `len(results)` is printed; `iterator` is an iterator over the sorted `results`; `n`, `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and `n` and `m` are printed.**
