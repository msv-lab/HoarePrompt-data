`n` and `m` are assigned the next values from `iterator`. If `iterator` has more items, `n` and `m` are updated to the next values. If `iterator` is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program typically handles this by breaking out of the loop or handling the exception.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, or a StopIteration exception is raised if `iterator` is exhausted.**
