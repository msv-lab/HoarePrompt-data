According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `total_squares`. If `total_squares` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. Let's analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step:

1. `total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by `2 * (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`
2. `n` is less than `x`
3. `m` is increased by 2
4. If `total_squares` equals `x`, `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `total_squares` is still less than `x`. Since `total_squares` is increased by `2 * (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, we need to adjust this value accordingly to remain less than `x`.

Given the information:
- `total_squares` was less than `x` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is less than `x`.
- `m` is increased by 2.

The required state adjustments are:
- `total_squares` must be adjusted to remain less than `x` after the increment.
- `n` remains less than `x`.
- `m` continues increasing by 2.

State: **`total_squares` is less than `x`, `n` is less than `x`, `m` is increased by 2**
