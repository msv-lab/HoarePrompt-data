`x` is assigned the value `int(input().strip())`, where `input` accepts an input, `strip()` removes any leading/trailing whitespace, and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `x` is between 1 and \(10^{18}\). There are no other variables affected in this snippet.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\)**
