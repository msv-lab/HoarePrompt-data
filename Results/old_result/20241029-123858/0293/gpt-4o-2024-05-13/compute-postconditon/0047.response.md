To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and current state:

### Analysis
The `while` loop condition is:
```
while n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Current State
- `n` has increased by 1
- `m` will have its initial value
- `total_squares` will be 0
- `results` will remain unmodified

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Check the Condition**:
   - The loop depends on whether `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Adjust `x` if Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Ensure `n` is Less Than the Limit**:
   - Given that `n` has increased by 1, we need to ensure `x` is such that `n` remains less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Current State Analysis**:
   - If `x` is sufficiently large and no suitable `(n, m)` pair exists, the loop will continue until `total_squares` exceeds `x`.
   - If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not start.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `x` such that `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Final State
- `n` has increased by 1
- `m` will have its initial value
- `total_squares` will be 0
- `results` will remain unmodified
- `x` should be adjusted to ensure `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`

Thus, the state should be:
State: **`n` has increased by 1, `m` will have its initial value, `total_squares` will be 0, `results` will remain unmodified, and `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`**
