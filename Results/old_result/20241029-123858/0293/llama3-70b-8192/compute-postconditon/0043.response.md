`tables` is a list, and the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to this list. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer, `m` is incremented by 2, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, `m` is less than `int(x`, and `tables` has a tuple `(n, m)` appended.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `m` is incremented by 2, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, `m` is less than `int(x`, and `tables` has a tuple `(n, m)` appended**
