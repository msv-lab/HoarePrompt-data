To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The while loop condition is:
```
while m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Based on this condition, the loop will execute as long as `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Now, let's look at the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is a positive integer
- `m` is incremented by 2
- `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`
- `m` is `n`
- `m` is less than `int(x)`
- If `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `tables` is appended with the tuple (`n`, `m`) containing the current values of `n` and `m`. The code does not handle the case where `func(n, m)` does not equal `x`, and `tables` remains unchanged in that scenario.

The key variables that determine whether the loop can execute again are `m` and `x`. Specifically, `m` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` for the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `m` is incremented by 2
- `m` is `n`
- `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`

These conditions suggest that `m` is now equal to `n`, and `m` has been incremented by 2 from its previous value. We also need to ensure that `m` is still less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. We need to ensure `m` is still less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. `n` should increase by 1 and still be less than `int(x)`, which means `n` should be less than or equal to `int(x) - 1`.
3. `m` being equal to `n` and incremented by 2 implies that `n` should be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1 - 2`.

Therefore, we need to update the state to reflect these conditions. The specific values of `n` and `m` should ensure that they meet the conditions for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `m` is incremented by 2, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`**
