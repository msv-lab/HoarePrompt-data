`m` is assigned the value of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`, `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x)`, `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is equal to `n`.**
