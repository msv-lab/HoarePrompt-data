To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute as long as `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `variable n is increased by 1`, we need to ensure that `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is still true.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:** `n` has been increased by 1.

2. **Loop condition:** `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the updated value of `n` after it has been increased by 1 must still be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

So, let's define the states clearly:
- The original value of `n` before it was increased by 1 was `n - 1`.
- After the increment, the new value of `n` is `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must satisfy `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` (after increment) is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

**State:** **variable `n` is increased by 1, and `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`**
