Postcondition: ***`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`, `countA` is 0, and `letter` is the first character of `userString`. If `letter` is 'B', `countB` is 1. If `letter` is not 'B', `countB` remains 0 and we either continue to the next iteration of the loop or skip the rest of the current iteration's code block.***
