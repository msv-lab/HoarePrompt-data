The value of `countB` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `countB` was 0 if `letter` was 'A', and 1 if `letter` was 'B'. Therefore, the new value of `countB` is 1 if `letter` was 'A', and 2 if `letter` was 'B'. The values of `userString`, `list(userString)`, `letter`, and `countA` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`, `letter` is the second character of `userString`, `countA` remains 1 if `letter` is 'A' and 0 if `letter` is 'B', `countB` is 1 if `letter` is 'A' and 2 if `letter` is 'B'.**
