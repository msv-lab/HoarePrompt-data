You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func_1(userString):
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
        
    #State: `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`, `countA` is the number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` is the number of 'B's in `userString`.
    if (countA > countB) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        if (countB > countA) :
            print('B')
            #This is printed: B
        else :
            pass
        #State: *`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`, `countA` is the number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` is the number of 'B's in `userString`. Additionally, `countA` is less than or equal to `countB`. If `countB` is greater than `countA`, the condition `countB > countA` holds true. If `countB` is equal to `countA`, the condition `countB == countA` holds true.
    #State: *`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`, `countA` is the number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` is the number of 'B's in `userString`. If `countA` is greater than `countB`, the condition `countA > countB` holds true. If `countA` is less than or equal to `countB`, the condition `countA <= countB` holds true. Specifically, if `countB` is greater than `countA`, the condition `countB > countA` holds true. If `countB` is equal to `countA`, the condition `countB == countA` holds true.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `userString` of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and returns a value based on the content of `userString`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
