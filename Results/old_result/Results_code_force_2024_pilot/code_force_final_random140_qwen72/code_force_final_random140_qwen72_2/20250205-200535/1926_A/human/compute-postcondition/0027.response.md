The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the character `'A'`.

Given the initial state:
- `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
- `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`.
- `countA` is the number of 'A's in `userString`.
- `countB` is the number of 'B's in `userString`.
- `countA` is greater than `countB`.

However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the character `'A'`.

Output: **A**
