Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string, and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string. If the total number of 'A' characters (`l`) is less than the total number of non-'A' characters (`h`), then `l` remains less than `h`.***
