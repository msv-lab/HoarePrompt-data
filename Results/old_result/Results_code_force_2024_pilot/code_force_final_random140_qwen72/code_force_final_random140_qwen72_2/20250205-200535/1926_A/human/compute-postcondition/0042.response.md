Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, and `j` is the second character of `a`. If the second character of `a` is 'A', `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a`. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1.***
