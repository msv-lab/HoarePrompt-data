### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string itself.
   - This part of the program correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem description.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the encoded string.
   - It first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, etc.).
   - The program then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are collected in the list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each decoded string on a new line.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case as required.
- The decoding logic is implemented according to the problem's specifications, ensuring that each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters of the encoded string.
- The output format matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
