#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is the result of replacing each character in the string `encoded` with its corresponding character from the reversed order of `unique_chars`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. In the returned string, each character from the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character from the reversed order of the unique characters found in `encoded`. This transformation ensures that the first unique character in `encoded` is mapped to the last unique character, the second to the second last, and so on.
