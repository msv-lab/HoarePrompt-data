Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the specified algorithm. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list `data`. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the encoded string `encoded`.

3. **Creating the Auxiliary String `r`**: It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string, sorts them, and joins them to form the string `r`.

4. **Creating the Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

5. **Decoding the String**: It uses the `char_map` to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping, effectively decoding the string.

6. **Outputting Results**: It collects all decoded strings and prints them one per line.

The logic and implementation align perfectly with the problem requirements, ensuring that the program produces the correct output for the given inputs.
