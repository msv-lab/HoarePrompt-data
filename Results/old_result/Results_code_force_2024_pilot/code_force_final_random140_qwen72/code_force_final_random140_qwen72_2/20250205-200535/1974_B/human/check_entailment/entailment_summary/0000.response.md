Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the specified algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works as intended:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It extracts the length `n` and the encoded string `encoded` for each test case.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string.
3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed order of `r`.
   - **Decoding**: It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped character from `char_map`.

The logic in `func_1` accurately follows the decoding process described in the problem statement. Each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character from the sorted unique characters, ensuring the correct decoding.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected, and the output matches the expected results for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
