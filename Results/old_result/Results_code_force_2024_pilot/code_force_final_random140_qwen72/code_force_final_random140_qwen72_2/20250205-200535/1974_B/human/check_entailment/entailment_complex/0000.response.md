Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Extracting Test Case Data**: For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed order of `r`.
   - **Decoding**: Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.

The logic in `func_1` accurately reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement. Each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character from the sorted unique characters, ensuring the correct decoding.

Therefore, the program is correct.
