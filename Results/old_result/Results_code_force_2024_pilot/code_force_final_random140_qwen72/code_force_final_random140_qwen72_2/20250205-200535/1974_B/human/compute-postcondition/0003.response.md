Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `r` is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` concatenated together, `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`, `decoded` is a string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`.** 

Explanation: The code creates a new string `decoded` by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`. The mapping in `char_map` is such that each character in `r` (which is a concatenation of `unique_chars`) is mapped to its reverse position in `r`. Therefore, `decoded` will contain the characters from `encoded` transformed according to this reverse mapping. All other variables (`encoded`, `unique_chars`, `r`, `char_map`) remain unchanged.
