The function `func_1` takes a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. In the returned string, each character from the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character from the reversed order of the unique characters found in `encoded`. This transformation ensures that the first unique character in `encoded` is mapped to the last unique character, the second to the second last, and so on.
