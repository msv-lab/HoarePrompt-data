The code snippet creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`. Here's the detailed step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
   - `r` is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` concatenated together.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The dictionary comprehension `{char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}` iterates over each character in `r` and maps it to the corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `char_map` is created and populated with the mappings.
   - The other variables (`encoded`, `unique_chars`, `r`) remain unchanged.

4. **Calculation**:
   - For each character `char` in `r` at index `i`, `char_map[char]` is set to `r[-i - 1]`.
   - This means the first character in `r` maps to the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` maps to the second-to-last character in `r`, and so on.

5. **Output State**:
   - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
   - `r` is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` concatenated together.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `r` is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` concatenated together, `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.**
