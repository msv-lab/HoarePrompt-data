Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1) - 1, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a list of integers containing the first `x` elements from the original `arr` list, `ans` is updated based on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2, `i` is `x + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` converts the first `x` elements of the original `arr` list into integers and stores them in a new list `arr`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The variable `i` remains `x + 1`.
- The new `arr` list contains only the first `x` elements from the original `arr`, converted to integers.
