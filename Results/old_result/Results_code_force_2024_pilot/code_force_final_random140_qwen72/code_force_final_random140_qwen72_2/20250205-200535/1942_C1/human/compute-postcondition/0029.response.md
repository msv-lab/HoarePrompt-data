Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1) - 1, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a sorted list of integers containing the first `x` elements from the original `arr` list plus the element `n + arr[0]`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `i` is `x + 1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = x - 2` updates the value of `ans` to be `x - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `ans` while keeping all other variables and conditions the same.
