You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: *`t` is 0, `n` is the last first integer from the input, `x` is the last second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the last third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it, and `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices `arr`.

2. **Sorting and Appending:**
   - The chosen vertices `arr` are sorted.
   - The program appends `n + arr[0]` to the end of `arr`. This is done to handle the circular nature of the polygon, ensuring that the last vertex connects back to the first.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with diagonals.

4. **Additional Triangles Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `arr` and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is 2. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - This check is necessary because if two consecutive vertices are exactly two positions apart, they can form an additional triangle with the vertex in between.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `ans` for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `8 4 0`, `1 6 2 5`
  - Sorted `arr`: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
  - Initial `ans`: `4 - 2 = 2`
  - Additional triangles: `arr[1] - arr[0] = 2 - 1 = 1` (no additional triangle), `arr[2] - arr[1] = 5 - 2 = 3` (no additional triangle), `arr[3] - arr[2] = 6 - 5 = 1` (no additional triangle)
  - Final `ans`: `2`
  - Expected Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `8 8 0`, `1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8`
  - Sorted `arr`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - Initial `ans`: `8 - 2 = 6`
  - Additional triangles: `arr[1] - arr[0] = 2 - 1 = 1` (no additional triangle), `arr[2] - arr[1] = 3 - 2 = 1` (no additional triangle), ..., `arr[7] - arr[6] = 8 - 7 = 1` (no additional triangle)
  - Final `ans`: `6`
  - Expected Output: `6`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `4 2 0`, `1 3`
  - Sorted `arr`: `[1, 3]`
  - Initial `ans`: `2 - 2 = 0`
  - Additional triangles: `arr[1] - arr[0] = 3 - 1 = 2` (one additional triangle)
  - Final `ans`: `0 + 1 = 1`
  - Expected Output: `2` (Note: The expected output in the problem statement is `2`, but the program correctly calculates `1` additional triangle, which should be `2` total triangles. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue in the problem statement or the program logic.)

### Conclusion:
The program logic is mostly correct, but there might be a small issue in handling the additional triangles. However, based on the provided test cases and the problem description, the program seems to be functioning as intended.
