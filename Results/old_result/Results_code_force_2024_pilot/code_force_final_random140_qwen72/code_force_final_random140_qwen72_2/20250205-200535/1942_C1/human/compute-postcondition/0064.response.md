Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 Â· 10^5, and `y` is always 0. Additionally, the function accepts a list of `x` distinct integers, each between 1 and `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
