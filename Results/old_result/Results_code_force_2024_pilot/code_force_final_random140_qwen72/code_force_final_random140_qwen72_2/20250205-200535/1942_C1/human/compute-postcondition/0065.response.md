Functionality: ** The function reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set includes three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` distinct integers. For each set, it processes the list to count the number of pairs of consecutive elements (including a wrapped-around pair) that have a difference of 2, and prints this count adjusted by subtracting 2 from `x`. After processing all sets, the function terminates with `t` being 0, and the last processed values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the modified list `arr` remaining in memory. **
