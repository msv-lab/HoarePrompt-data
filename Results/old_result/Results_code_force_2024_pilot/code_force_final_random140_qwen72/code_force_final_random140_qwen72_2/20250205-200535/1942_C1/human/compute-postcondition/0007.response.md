The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `arr` but does not affect the other variables. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1)
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `arr` is a list of integers containing the second line of input which consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`

After executing `arr.sort()`, the list `arr` will be sorted in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
