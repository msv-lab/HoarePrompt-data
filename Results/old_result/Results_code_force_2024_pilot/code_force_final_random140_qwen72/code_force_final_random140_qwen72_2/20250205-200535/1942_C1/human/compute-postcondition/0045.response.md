Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 (decremented by 2), `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `i` is `x + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The line `arr = input().split()` changes the value of `arr` to a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by spaces.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
