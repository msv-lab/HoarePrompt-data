The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` was `x - 2`, so after the increment, `ans` becomes `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `arr` now includes an additional element which is `n + arr[0]`, `ans` is `x - 1`, `i` is 1, and the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` is 2.**
