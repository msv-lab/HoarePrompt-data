Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 (decremented by 2), `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a sorted list of integers containing the elements from the original `arr` starting from index 0 up to index `x-1` with `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x - 2`, and the difference between the elements at indices `i` and `i - 1` in `arr` is 2.**
