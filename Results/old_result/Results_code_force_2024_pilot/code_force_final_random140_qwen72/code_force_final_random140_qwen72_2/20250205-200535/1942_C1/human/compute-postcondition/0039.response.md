Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1) - 1, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a sorted list of integers containing the first `x` elements from the original `arr` list plus the element `n + arr[0]`, `i` is 3. If the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) in the `arr` list is 2, then `ans` is `x + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x`.***
