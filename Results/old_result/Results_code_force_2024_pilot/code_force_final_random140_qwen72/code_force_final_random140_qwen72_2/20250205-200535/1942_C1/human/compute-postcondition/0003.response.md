Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is 0, and the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is currently executing the main block of code because the `__name__` variable is equal to `'__main__'`.**
