Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case individually. Each test case involves reading `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by the list of integers `l`.

2. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list `l` is a crucial step because it allows us to check the properties of the progressive square more easily. The program correctly sorts the list.

3. **Range Check**: The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted list is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This is a valid check to ensure that the elements span the correct range for the progressive square.

4. **Sum Check**: The program calculates the sum of the first and last elements in the sorted list (`a = l[0] + l[-1]`). This sum is used to verify the middle element when `n` is odd.

5. **Middle Element Check**: If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list is equal to `a // 2`. This is a necessary condition for the progressive square when `n` is odd.

6. **Symmetry Check**: The program checks if the elements in the first half of the sorted list are symmetric to the elements in the second half. This ensures that the elements form a valid progressive square.

7. **Return Values**: The program returns 'no' and 'yes' instead of 'NO' and 'YES'. This is a minor issue but will cause the output to be incorrect according to the problem statement. The original assessment correctly identified this issue.

8. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called within the loop for each test case, and the result is printed. This is done correctly.

**Conclusion**:
The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the output format. The output should be 'NO' and 'YES' instead of 'no' and 'yes'. This is a critical issue because the problem statement explicitly requires the output to be in uppercase.

Final: **False**
