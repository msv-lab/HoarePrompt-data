Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case involves reading `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by the list of integers `l`.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `l`. This is necessary because the properties of the progressive square need to be checked against the sorted list of elements.

3. **Range Check**: The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted list is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This ensures that the elements span the correct range for the progressive square.

4. **Sum Check**: The program calculates the sum of the first and last elements in the sorted list (`a = l[0] + l[-1]`). This sum should be consistent with the properties of the progressive square.

5. **Middle Element Check**: If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list is equal to `a // 2`. This is a necessary condition for the progressive square when `n` is odd.

6. **Symmetry Check**: The program checks if the elements in the first half of the sorted list are symmetric to the elements in the second half. This ensures that the elements form a valid progressive square.

7. **Return Values**: The program returns 'no' if any of the conditions fail, and 'yes' if all conditions are met. However, the output should be 'NO' and 'YES' as specified in the problem statement.

8. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called within the loop for each test case, and the result is printed.

**Issues**:
- The function `func_1` returns 'no' and 'yes' instead of 'NO' and 'YES'. This is a minor issue but will cause the output to be incorrect according to the problem statement.

**Conclusion**:
The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the output format. The output should be 'NO' and 'YES' instead of 'no' and 'yes'.

Given the annotations and the detailed reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program is logically correct but fails to meet the exact output format requirements specified in the problem statement.

Final: **False**
