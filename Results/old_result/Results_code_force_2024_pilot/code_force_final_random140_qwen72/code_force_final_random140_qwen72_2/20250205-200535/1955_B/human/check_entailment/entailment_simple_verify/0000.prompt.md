You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the construction of the progressive square correctly. Specifically, the logic used to verify the elements of the array `l` against the rules of the progressive square is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Check for Sum of Diagonals**: The program checks if the sum of the smallest and largest elements (`a = l[0] + l[-1]`) is equal to twice the middle element (`l[r] == a // 2`). This check is not sufficient to ensure that the elements form a valid progressive square. The progressive square has specific rules for constructing its elements, and this simple arithmetic check does not capture those rules.

2. **Incorrect Pairing Check**: The program checks if each element `l[k]` is equal to its corresponding element `l[-1 - k]`. This check is intended to ensure symmetry, but it does not correctly verify the progressive nature of the square. The progressive square is constructed such that each element is derived from the previous elements using the constants `c` and `d`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array `l` might contain duplicate elements or elements that do not fit the progressive square pattern. For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `c = 2`, `d = 3`, and the array `l` is `[3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]`. The program incorrectly returns 'no' because it does not correctly verify the progressive square construction.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3 2 3
  3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `NO`
- **Actual Output**: `no`

The program should return `NO` because the elements do not form a valid progressive square. However, the program's logic is not robust enough to correctly identify this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
