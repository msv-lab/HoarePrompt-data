Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), `a` is equal to `l[0] + l[-1]`, `r` is equal to n^2 // 2, if `n` is odd, `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`, `k` is r-1, and for all indices `i` from 0 to r-1, `l[i]` is equal to `l[-1 - i]`. If any `l[i]` is not equal to `l[-1 - i]`, the program returns 'no'. Otherwise, the loop completes without returning anything.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `k` will have reached the value `r-1`, which is the last index the loop checks. The list `l` remains sorted in non-decreasing order, and the conditions on `n`, `c`, `d`, and the relationship between the first and last elements of `l` are still satisfied. Additionally, for every index `i` from 0 to `r-1`, the element at index `i` in `l` is equal to the element at the corresponding mirrored index `-1 - i`. If at any point during the loop an element does not match its mirrored counterpart, the function would have returned 'no'. Since the loop completes without returning 'no', it implies that the list `l` is symmetric around its center.
