Output State: **The program returns 'yes'**. This indicates that all elements in the list `l` satisfy the condition `l[i] == l[-1 - i]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `r-1`, where `r` is `n^2 // 2`. Therefore, the list `l` is symmetric around its center, and the program confirms this by returning 'yes'.
