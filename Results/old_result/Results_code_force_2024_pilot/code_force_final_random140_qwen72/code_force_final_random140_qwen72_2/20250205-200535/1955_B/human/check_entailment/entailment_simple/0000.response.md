Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and a list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Sorting and Initial Check**: The list `l` is sorted, and the program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in `l` is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This check ensures that the range of the elements in `l` matches the expected range for a progressive square.

3. **Middle Element Check for Odd `n`**: If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list `l` is equal to half the sum of the first and last elements (`a // 2`). This ensures that the middle element of the progressive square is correctly positioned.

4. **Symmetry Check**: The program then checks if the list `l` is symmetric around its center. This is done by comparing each element `l[k]` with `l[-1 - k]` for all `k` from `0` to `r-1` (where `r` is `n^2 // 2`). This ensures that the elements form a valid progressive square.

5. **Final Return**: If all checks pass, the program returns 'yes'. If any check fails, it returns 'no'.

Given the problem constraints and the steps taken by the program, the logic appears to be sound and should correctly identify whether the given list `l` can form a progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Correctness: **True**
