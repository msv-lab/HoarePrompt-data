### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n * n` integers.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `l` is sorted. This is necessary to check the properties of the progressive square.

3. **Range Check:**
   - The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list `l` is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This ensures that the range of values in the list matches the expected range for a progressive square.
   - If this condition is not met, the function returns 'no'.

4. **Sum Check:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the smallest and largest values in the sorted list `l` and stores it in `a`.

5. **Middle Element Check:**
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list `l` is equal to `a // 2`. This is because in a progressive square with an odd `n`, the middle element should be the average of the smallest and largest values.
   - If this condition is not met, the function returns 'NO'.

6. **Symmetry Check:**
   - The program checks if the elements in the first half of the sorted list `l` are symmetric to the elements in the second half. This ensures that the elements form a valid progressive square.
   - If this condition is not met, the function returns 'no'.

7. **Final Return:**
   - If all conditions are met, the function returns 'yes'.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the provided rules.
- The conditions and checks are logically sound and cover all the necessary aspects of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
