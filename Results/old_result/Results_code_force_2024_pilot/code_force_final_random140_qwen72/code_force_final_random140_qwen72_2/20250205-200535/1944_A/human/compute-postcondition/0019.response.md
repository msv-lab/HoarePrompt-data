The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `reachable_count - 1` from its current value. Given that `reachable_count` is equal to `n`, the expression `reachable_count - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - n + 1`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - n + 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`**
