The value of `k` is decremented by `reachable_count - 1`. Given that `reachable_count` is equal to `n`, the expression `reachable_count - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, `k` is decreased by `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now greater than `(n * (n - 1) // 2) - (n - 1)` and the adjusted value of `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `qs` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`**.
