Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, `qs` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, and `reachable_count` is equal to 1 for each test case.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged because it represents the total number of test cases, which is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: For each test case, `n` and `k` are read from input and used within the loop. The values of `n` and `k` are reset for each new test case.
- **`qs`**: The variable `qs` is decremented with each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations, `qs` will be 0.
- **`_`**: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop to iterate over the range of `qs`. It does not affect the state.
- **`reachable_count`**: For each test case, the inner loop reduces `k` and `reachable_count` until `k` is less than `reachable_count - 1` or `k` is no longer greater than 0. Eventually, `reachable_count` will be 1 for each test case, as the loop continues to decrement `reachable_count` until the condition is met.
