Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is modified to be `k - (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- `qs` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `reachable_count` is explicitly set to 1.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will output the value of `reachable_count`.

Output: **1**
