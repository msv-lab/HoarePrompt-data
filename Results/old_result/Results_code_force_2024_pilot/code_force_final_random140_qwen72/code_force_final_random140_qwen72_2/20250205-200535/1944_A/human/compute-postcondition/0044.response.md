The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, a function with such parameters would process each test case and return some result based on `n` and `k`.

Given the lack of specific output details, I'll assume the function processes each test case and returns a result for each case. The exact nature of the result is not clear from the provided information, so I'll describe the functionality in general terms.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` represents the number of test cases, with each test case consisting of integers `n` and `k`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
