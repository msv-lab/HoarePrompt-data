Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `qs` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `reachable_count = n` updates the value of `reachable_count` to be equal to the value of `n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
