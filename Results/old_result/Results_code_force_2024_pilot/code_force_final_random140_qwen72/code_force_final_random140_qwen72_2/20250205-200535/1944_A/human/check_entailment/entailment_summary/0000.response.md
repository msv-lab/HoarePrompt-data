Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. The key insight is that if `k` is at least `n - 1`, Dominater can isolate island 1 from all other islands by destroying `n - 1` bridges. This leaves Everule with only one island to visit (island 1). If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- If `k >= n - 1`, the function returns `1`, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.
- Otherwise, the function returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all `n` islands.

The program also correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case to call `func_1` with the appropriate inputs.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
