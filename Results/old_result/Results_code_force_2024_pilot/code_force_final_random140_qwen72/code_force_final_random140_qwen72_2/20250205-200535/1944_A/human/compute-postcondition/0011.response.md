Output State: **`k` is now `k - (reachable_count - 1)` and must remain greater than or equal to `n - 3` and greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - (reachable_count - 1)`.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 3` and greater than 0 still holds.
- The initial state condition that `k` must be at least `n - 2` and greater than 0 is maintained after the adjustment.
