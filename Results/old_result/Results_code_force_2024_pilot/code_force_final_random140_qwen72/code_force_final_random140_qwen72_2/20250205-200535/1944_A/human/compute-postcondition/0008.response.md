The code `k -= reachable_count - 1` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `reachable_count - 1` from its current value. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2
- `qs` must be greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`
- `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`
- `k` must be at least `n - 2` and greater than 0

Let's calculate the new value of `k`:

1. `reachable_count` is `n - 1`.
2. The code `k -= reachable_count - 1` means `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1 - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - (n - 2)`.

Since `k` was already updated to `k - (n - 1)` before this code, the new value of `k` will be:

\[ k = (k - (n - 1)) - (n - 2) \]
\[ k = k - (n - 1) - (n - 2) \]
\[ k = k - (n - 1 + n - 2) \]
\[ k = k - (2n - 3) \]

Therefore, the new value of `k` is `k - (2n - 3)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (2n - 3)`, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`, and `k` must be at least `n - 2` and greater than 0.**
