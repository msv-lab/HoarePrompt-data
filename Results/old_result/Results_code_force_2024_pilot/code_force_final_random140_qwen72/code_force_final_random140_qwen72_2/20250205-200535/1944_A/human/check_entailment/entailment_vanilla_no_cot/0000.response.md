Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where destroying a certain number of bridges (less than \( n-1 \)) can still isolate some islands from island 1. The function should consider the maximum number of islands that can be isolated by destroying up to \( k \) bridges.

A correct implementation would need to calculate the minimum number of islands that can be reached after optimally destroying \( k \) bridges. The correct logic should be:

- If \( k \geq n - 1 \), then Everule can only visit island 1, so the answer is 1.
- Otherwise, the number of islands that can be visited is \( n - \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n-1} \right\rfloor \).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return max(1, n - (k // (n - 1)))
```

This version correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
