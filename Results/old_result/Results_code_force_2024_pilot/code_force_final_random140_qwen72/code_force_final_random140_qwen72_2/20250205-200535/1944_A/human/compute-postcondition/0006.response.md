Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`, and `k` must be at least `n - 1` and greater than 0.**
