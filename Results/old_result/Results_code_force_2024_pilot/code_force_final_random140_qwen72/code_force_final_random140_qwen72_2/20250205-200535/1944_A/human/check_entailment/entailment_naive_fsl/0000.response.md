Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` returns `n` if `k < n - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the maximum number of islands that can be isolated by destroying `k` bridges.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, Dominater can destroy up to 2 bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit. If Dominater destroys the bridges between island 1 and island 2, and between island 1 and island 3, Everule will only be able to visit islands 1 and 4. Therefore, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is 2, not 4 as the program would output.

A correct implementation should consider the optimal way to isolate islands by destroying bridges. The correct logic should be:

- If `k >= n - 1`, Everule can only visit island 1.
- Otherwise, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is `n - k // (n - 1)`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return max(1, n - k // (n - 1))
```

This ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly.
