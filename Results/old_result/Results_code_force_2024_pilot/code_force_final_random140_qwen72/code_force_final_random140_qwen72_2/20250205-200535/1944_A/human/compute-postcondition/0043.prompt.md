Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. qs is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(qs):
    n, k = [int(num) for num in input().split()]
    reachable_count = n
    while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
        k -= reachable_count - 1
        reachable_count -= 1
    print(reachable_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is reduced by the sum of the first `m` terms of the sequence `n-1, n-2, ..., 1` where `m` is the number of iterations the loop runs, and `reachable_count` is equal to `n - m`. The loop stops when `k` is less than `reachable_count - 1` or `k` is no longer greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now greater than or equal to 0, `qs` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
