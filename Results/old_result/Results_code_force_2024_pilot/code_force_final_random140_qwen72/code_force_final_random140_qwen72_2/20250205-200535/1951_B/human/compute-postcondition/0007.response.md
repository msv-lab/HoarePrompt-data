Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is 1, `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` in the list `a` is greater than the element at index `k - 1` in the list `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
