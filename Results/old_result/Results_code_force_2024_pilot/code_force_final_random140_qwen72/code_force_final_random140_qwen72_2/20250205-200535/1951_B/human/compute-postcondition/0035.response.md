To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]`.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists.
- `wins_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` from `wins_with_swap` to `k - 1` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` plus `wins + 1`.

### Explanation of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))
```

Let's break it down:
1. **`wins - 1`**: This is simply `wins` minus 1.
2. **`wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`**:
   - `wins_with_swap - wins - 1`: This subtracts `wins` and 1 from `wins_with_swap`.
   - `(wins > 0)`: This is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if `wins` is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.
   - Therefore, `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)` simplifies to:
     - If `wins > 0`, then `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + 1` which is `wins_with_swap - wins`.
     - If `wins == 0`, then `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + 0` which is `wins_with_swap - 1`.

3. **`max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0))`**:
   - This takes the maximum of the two values calculated above.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the maximum of:
- `wins - 1`
- `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`

Given the definitions and the logic, the output will be:
Output: **max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)) (where wins is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to a[k - 1] before encountering an element greater than a[k - 1], and wins_with_swap is the number of elements in a from wins_with_swap to k - 1 that are less than or equal to a[k - 1] plus wins + 1)**
