Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]`.
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists.
   - The current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(wins - 1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `wins` is defined as the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]`.
   - Since `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means there are at least `k` elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`.
   - The print statement `print(wins - 1)` will output the value of `wins` minus 1.

Given that `wins` is at least `k`, the output will be `wins - 1`.

Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]` and wins is greater than or equal to `k`)**
