Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `wins_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` from `wins_with_swap` to `k - 1` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` plus `wins + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, and `i`**: These variables remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- **`wins_with_swap`**: This variable starts as `wins + 1` and is incremented for each element in the range from `wins_with_swap` to `k - 1` that is less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. The loop stops if it encounters an element greater than `a[k - 1]`. Therefore, `wins_with_swap` will be the number of elements in `a` from `wins_with_swap` to `k - 1` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` plus the initial value of `wins + 1`.
