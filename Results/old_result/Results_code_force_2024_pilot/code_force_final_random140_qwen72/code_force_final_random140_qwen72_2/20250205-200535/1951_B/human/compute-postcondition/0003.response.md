The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already given as an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, this condition is satisfied. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and `n` is within the specified range (which it already is).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is 0, `i` is 0**
