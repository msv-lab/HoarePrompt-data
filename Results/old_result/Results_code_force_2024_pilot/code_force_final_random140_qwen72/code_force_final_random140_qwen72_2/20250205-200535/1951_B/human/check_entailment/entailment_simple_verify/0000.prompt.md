You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the logic correctly for determining the maximum number of wins for the cow `k`. Specifically, the logic for calculating `wins` and `wins_with_swap` is flawed. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` is used to calculate the initial number of wins for the cow `k` without any swaps. However, this loop does not correctly simulate the matches as described in the problem. It simply counts how many cows before `k` have a lower rating, which is not the same as simulating the matches.
   - The condition `if a[i] > a[k - 1]: break` will stop counting as soon as it finds a cow with a higher rating, but it does not account for the fact that the cow `k` might still win subsequent matches if the previous matches were won by cows with lower ratings.

2. **Wins with Swap Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating `wins_with_swap` is also incorrect. The variable `wins_with_swap` is initialized as `wins + 1`, which assumes that swapping the cow `k` to a different position will always result in one additional win. This is not necessarily true.
   - The loop `for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):` is intended to simulate the matches after the swap, but it does not correctly handle the matches. It incorrectly increments `wins_with_swap` without considering the actual match outcomes.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final output `print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))` is overly complex and does not clearly reflect the correct logic for determining the maximum number of wins.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
```
- According to the problem, the cow with index 1 (rating 12) should win 1 match if no swaps are made.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the wins and may produce an incorrect result.

To fix the program, a more accurate simulation of the matches is needed, both with and without the swap, to ensure that the maximum number of wins is correctly determined.
