Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    wins_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 2`, `wins < k - 2`. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than the element at index `k - 1` in `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop iterates over the range from `wins_with_swap` to `k - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current value in the range. For the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `wins_with_swap` is incremented by 1, making it `wins_with_swap + 1`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the loop is terminated, and the values of `wins_with_swap`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins_with_swap + 2`, `k` remains unchanged. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
