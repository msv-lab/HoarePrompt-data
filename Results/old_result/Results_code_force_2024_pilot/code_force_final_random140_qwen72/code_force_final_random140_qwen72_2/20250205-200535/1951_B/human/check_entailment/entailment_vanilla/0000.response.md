### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination tournament where the cow with the higher rating wins.
   - We need to maximize the number of wins for cow `k` by optionally swapping its position with another cow once.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` starts by reading the number of cows `n` and the index of our cow `k`.
   - It reads the ratings of the cows into a list `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `wins` to count the number of matches our cow can win without any swaps.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to count how many consecutive matches our cow can win starting from its initial position.

3. **Wins Without Swap:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` checks if the current cow's rating is greater than our cow's rating. If it is, the loop breaks, and `wins` is the number of matches won.
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means our cow can win all the matches up to its initial position, so we print `wins - 1`.

4. **Wins With Swap:**
   - The variable `wins_with_swap` is initialized to `wins + 1` to account for the potential additional win after a swap.
   - The loop `for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):` checks if the cow at position `i` has a rating lower than our cow's rating. If it does, `wins_with_swap` is incremented.
   - The final result is the maximum of `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for counting wins without a swap is correct.
   - The logic for counting wins with a swap is also correct, but the final calculation of `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)` seems overly complex and might be incorrect.
   - The condition `if wins >= k` should be `if wins >= k - 1` because the initial position of our cow is `k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program has some logical issues in the final calculation of wins with a swap and the condition for checking the number of wins without a swap. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
