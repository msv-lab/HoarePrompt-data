The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for a group of cows. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the rating of a specified cow (at index `k-1`), considering both the original list and a hypothetical scenario where the specified cow's rating is swapped with the next higher rating in the list. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
