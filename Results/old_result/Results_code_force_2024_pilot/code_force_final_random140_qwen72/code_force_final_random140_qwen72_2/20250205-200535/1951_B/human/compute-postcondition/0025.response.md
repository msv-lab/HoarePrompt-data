Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 2`, `wins < k - 2`. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than the element at index `k - 1` in `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
