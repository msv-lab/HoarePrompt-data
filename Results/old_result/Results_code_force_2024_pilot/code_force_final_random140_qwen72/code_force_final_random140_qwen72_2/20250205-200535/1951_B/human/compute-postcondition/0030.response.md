The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `wins_with_swap`, and `k`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables change.

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current value in the range.
- For the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `wins_with_swap` is incremented by 1, making it `wins_with_swap + 1`.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Given this information, let's adjust the state:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `wins_with_swap` is incremented by 1.
- `k` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range defined by `wins_with_swap` and `k - 1`.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins_with_swap + 1`, `k` remains unchanged**
