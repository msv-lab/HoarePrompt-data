The only objects in the loop head are the variables `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least three elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, and `result` is the second element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least three elements, and `result` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least three elements, `result` is the third element in the `results` list**
