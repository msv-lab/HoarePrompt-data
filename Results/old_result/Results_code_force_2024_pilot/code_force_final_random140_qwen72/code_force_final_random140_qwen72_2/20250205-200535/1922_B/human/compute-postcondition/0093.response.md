Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the integer value of `data[current_index]`, `current_index` is increased by `n + 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1.
- Initially, `current_index` was increased by `n + 1`. After the code execution, `current_index` is further increased by 1, making the total increase `n + 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
