Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The `input` function now reads from `sys.stdin`.**
