Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, and the first two elements of `a` are equal (`a[0] == a[1]`).**
