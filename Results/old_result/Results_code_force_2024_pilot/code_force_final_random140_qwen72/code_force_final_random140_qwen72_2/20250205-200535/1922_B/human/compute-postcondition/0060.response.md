The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Given that `current_index` was initially `current_index + 2`, after the increment, `current_index` will be `current_index + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` has three new elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - 2]`, `data[current_index - 1]`, and `data[current_index]`, `current_index` is now `current_index + 3`.**
