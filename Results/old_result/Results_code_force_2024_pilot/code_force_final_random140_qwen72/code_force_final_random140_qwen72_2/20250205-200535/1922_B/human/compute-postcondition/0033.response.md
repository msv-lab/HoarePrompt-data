Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary. If `a[1]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` contains keys `a[0]` and `a[1]`, both with the value `0`. If `a[1]` is already in `hashing`, then `hashing` remains unchanged with the key `a[0]` having the value `0`.***
