Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the integer values of `data[current_index - 1]`, `data[current_index + n + 1]`, and `data[current_index + n + 2]`, `current_index` is increased by `n + 4`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `current_index` is increased by `n + 3`.
- The code snippet `current_index += 1` further increments `current_index` by 1.
- Therefore, the total increment to `current_index` is `n + 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 4`.
- The list `a` is updated to reflect the new `current_index` value, so it now contains the integer values of `data[current_index - 1]`, `data[current_index + n + 1]`, and `data[current_index + n + 2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
