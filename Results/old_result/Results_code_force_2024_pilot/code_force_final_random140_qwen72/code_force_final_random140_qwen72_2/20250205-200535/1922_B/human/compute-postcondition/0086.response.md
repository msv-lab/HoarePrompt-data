The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` remains the same as its initial value, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, and `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be decremented by 1 since the loop iterates `t` times. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for another iteration to occur.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` remains the same as its initial value, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it.**
