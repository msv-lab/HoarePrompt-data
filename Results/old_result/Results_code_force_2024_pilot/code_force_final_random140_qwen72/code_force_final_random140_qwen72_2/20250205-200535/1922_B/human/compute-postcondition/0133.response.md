Output State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. Each element in the `results` list is the `ans` value calculated during each iteration of the loop. The `data` list remains unchanged, and the other variables (`current_index`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, and `hashing`) are in their final states as described in the initial state.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain all the `ans` values computed during each iteration. The `data` list will still be the same as it was initially, and the other variables will be reset or updated according to the final state described in the initial conditions.
