Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[0]` and value `0`. If `a[i]` (which is `a[0]`) is equal to `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[1]`), then the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is the value of `hashing[a[1]]` if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]` and `a[1]`, where `hashing[a[0]]` is 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` is either 1 or incremented by 1 if `a[1]` was not initially in `hashing` or was already present, respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`. If `a[2]` is not initially in `hashing`, `hashing[a[2]]` is set to 0 and then incremented by 2. If `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) equals `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[3]`), `ans` is 4 if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` is 2. If `a[i]` does not equal `a[i + 1]`, `ans` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
