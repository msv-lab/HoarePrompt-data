Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]` and `a[1]` both having the value `0`.**

Explanation:
- The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `hashing` where the key is `a[1]` and the value is `0`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`.
- The dictionary `hashing` initially had the key `a[0]` with the value `0`.
- After executing the code, `hashing` now contains two keys: `a[0]` and `a[1]`, both with the value `0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
