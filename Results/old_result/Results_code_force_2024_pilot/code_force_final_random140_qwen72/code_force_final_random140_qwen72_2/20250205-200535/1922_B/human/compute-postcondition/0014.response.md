The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is 3, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the integer value of `data[2]`, `i` is 1**
