The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Given that `i` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, and `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, the value added to `ans` is 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `n`, and `hashing[a[0]]` remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
