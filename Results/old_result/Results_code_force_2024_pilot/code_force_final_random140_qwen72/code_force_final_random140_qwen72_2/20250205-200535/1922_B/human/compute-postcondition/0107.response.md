The code snippet `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value associated with the key `a[0]` in the `hashing` dictionary by the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and the element at index 0 of the list `a` is already in the `hashing` dictionary with the value 0 (as per the precondition).

Therefore, the value of `hashing[a[0]]` is incremented by 0, which means it remains 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0.**
