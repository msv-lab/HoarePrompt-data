The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `current_index` is `2 + n`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is greater than 2
- `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is the value of `hashing[a[1]]` if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0
- `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and possibly `a[2]`. If `a[2]` is not in `hashing`, `hashing[a[2]]` is set to 0, and `hashing[a[2]]` is now `hashing[a[2]] + 2`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.
2. `hashing[a[2]]` is the value associated with the key `a[2]` in the dictionary `hashing`.
3. `ans` is updated by adding `hashing[a[2]]` to its current value.

Since `hashing[a[2]]` was previously set to 0 and then incremented by 2, `hashing[a[2]]` is now 2.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is:
- If `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, `ans` was initially `hashing[a[1]]` (which is also `hashing[a[2]]` because `a[1] == a[2]`), so `ans` was 2. Adding `hashing[a[2]]` (which is 2) results in `ans` being 4.
- If `a[1]` does not equal `a[2]`, `ans` was initially 0. Adding `hashing[a[2]]` (which is 2) results in `ans` being 2.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `ans` is 4 if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, and `hashing[a[2]]` is 2.**
