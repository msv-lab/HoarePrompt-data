Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]` within the range of the loop, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys from the elements of `a` and values representing the cumulative index sums for each element as per the loop's logic.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`current_index`**: Remains `2 + n` as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`data`**: Remains a list of strings as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`results`**: Remains an empty list as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`a`**: Remains a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2`.
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the values of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]` within the range of the loop.
- **`hashing`**: This dictionary contains keys from the elements of `a` and values representing the cumulative index sums for each element as per the loop's logic. For each unique element in `a`, the value in `hashing` is the sum of the indices where that element appears in the list `a`.
