Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` remains the same as its initial value, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, and `current_index` is increased by `n`. The values of `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged.** 

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n - 1`, indicating the last iteration. The list `a` will have been populated with `n` elements, each being the integer value of the corresponding elements from the `data` list starting from the initial `current_index`. The `current_index` will have been incremented by `n`, reflecting the total number of elements appended to `a`. The other variables (`t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing`) will remain in their initial states, as they are not modified within the loop.
