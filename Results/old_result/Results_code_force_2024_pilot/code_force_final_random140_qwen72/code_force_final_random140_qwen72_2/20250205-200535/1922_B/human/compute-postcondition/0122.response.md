The value of `i` is 2, and `hashing[a[2]]` is 2. The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` adds the value of `hashing[a[2]]` (which is 2) to `ans`. Since `ans` remains unchanged before this operation, its new value is `ans + 2`. The other conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `hashing[a[2]]` is 2, `ans` is `ans + 2`.**
