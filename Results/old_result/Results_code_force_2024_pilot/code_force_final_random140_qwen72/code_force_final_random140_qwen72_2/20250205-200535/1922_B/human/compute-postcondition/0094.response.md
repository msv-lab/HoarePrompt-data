The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`
- `n` remains the same, but it must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is now `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, which is always true as long as `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the integer value of `data[current_index]`, `current_index` is increased by `n + 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**
