Initial State: `results` is a list containing at least three elements, and `result` is the third element in the `results` list.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The `results` list is given to contain at least three elements.
2. The variable `result` is assigned the value of the third element in the `results` list. In Python, indexing starts at 0, so the third element is at index 2.
3. The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`.

Since the exact values of the elements in the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the value of `result` based on its position in the list.

Output: **result (where result is the third element in the results list)**
