The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the value of `hashing[a[1]]` if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]` and `a[1]`, where `hashing[a[0]]` is 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` is either 1 or incremented by 1 if `a[1]` was not initially in `hashing` or was already present, respectively.**
