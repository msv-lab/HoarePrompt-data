Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by adding `i` to its current value.
- Given `i` is 1, the code updates `hashing[a[1]]` by adding 1 to its current value.
- Since `i` is 1, `hashing[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[1]` was not in `hashing`, it was initialized to 0, so `hashing[a[1]]` becomes 1.
- If `a[1]` was already in `hashing`, its value was 0, so `hashing[a[1]]` becomes 1.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain the same.
- The value of `hashing[a[0]]` remains 0.
