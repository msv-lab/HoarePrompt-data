Initial State: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1. If `a[2]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[2]]` is set to 0 and `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, if `a[2]` is in `hashing`, `ans` remains 0.

Code Snippet:
```
hashing[a[i]] += i
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. `i` is 2.
2. `a` is a list of `n` elements, sorted in ascending order.
3. `hashing` is a dictionary that maps elements of `a` to integers.
4. The code updates the value of `hashing[a[2]]` by adding `i` (which is 2) to its current value.
5. Since `i` is 2, the value of `hashing[a[2]]` will be incremented by 2.

Given the initial state:
- `hashing[a[0]]` is 0.
- `hashing[a[1]]` is 1.
- If `a[2]` is not in `hashing`, it is set to 0 initially.

Therefore, if `a[2]` is not in `hashing`, it will be set to 0 and then incremented by 2, resulting in `hashing[a[2]]` being 2. If `a[2]` is already in `hashing`, its value will be incremented by 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `hashing[a[2]]` is incremented by 2, `ans` remains 0.**
