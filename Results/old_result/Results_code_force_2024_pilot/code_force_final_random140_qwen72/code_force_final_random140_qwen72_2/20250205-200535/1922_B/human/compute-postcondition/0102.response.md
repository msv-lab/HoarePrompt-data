Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[current_index]` through `data[current_index + n - 1]`, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0.**
