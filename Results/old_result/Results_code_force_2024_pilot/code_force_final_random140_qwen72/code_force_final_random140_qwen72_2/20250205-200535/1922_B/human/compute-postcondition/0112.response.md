The code snippet `hashing[a[i]] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 2. The value of `a[1]` is used to update the dictionary `hashing`.

Since `i` is 1, the code updates `hashing[a[1]]` to 0. The initial state mentions that `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, and if `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `ans` remains unchanged. However, the code only affects `hashing[a[1]]`, so the value of `ans` is not impacted by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
