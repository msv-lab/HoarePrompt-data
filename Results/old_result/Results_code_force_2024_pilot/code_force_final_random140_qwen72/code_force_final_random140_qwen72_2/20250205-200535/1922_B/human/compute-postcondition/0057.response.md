Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` has a new element which is the integer value of `data[current_index - 2]` and another new element which is the integer value of `data[current_index - 1]`, `current_index` is now `current_index + 2`.** 

Explanation: The code increments `current_index` by 1. Since `current_index` was already increased by 1 in the initial state, it is now increased by an additional 1, making it `current_index + 2`. The elements in `a` remain the same, as they were described in the initial state. The values of `i` and `n` are unchanged.
