The code snippet `hashing[a[i]] = 0` updates the value of the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing` to 0. Given that `i` is 2, the key being updated is `a[2]`. 

Let's break down the impact:

- `hashing[a[2]]` is set to 0.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the value of `hashing[a[1]]` if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, where `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is either 1 or incremented by 1 if `a[1]` was not initially in `hashing` or was already present, respectively, and `hashing[a[2]]` is 0.**
