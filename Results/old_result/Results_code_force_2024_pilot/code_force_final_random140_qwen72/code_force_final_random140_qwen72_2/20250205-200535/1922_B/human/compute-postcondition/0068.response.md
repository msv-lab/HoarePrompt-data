Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is now 0 + 0 = 0.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value of `hashing[a[0]]` by `i`. Since `i` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` remains 0. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
