Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `current_index` is 1, `data` is a list of strings, each element being one of the inputs split by spaces, `results` is an empty list, and the remaining preconditions (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) are still valid.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    hashing = {}
    n = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(data[current_index]))
        current_index += 1
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] not in hashing:
            hashing[a[i]] = 0
        hashing[a[i]] += i
        if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
            ans += hashing[a[i]]
    results.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing one element which is `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]` within the range of the loop, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys from the elements of `a` and values representing the cumulative index sums for each element as per the loop's logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` remains the same as its initial value, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged. `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `hashing` contains the cumulative indices for each unique element in `a` up to `a[n-2]`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are equal to their next element in `a`. `data` remains unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
