Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is the value of `hashing[a[1]]` if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]` and `a[1]`, where `hashing[a[0]]` is 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` is either 1 or incremented by 1 if `a[1]` was not initially in `hashing` or was already present, respectively.***
