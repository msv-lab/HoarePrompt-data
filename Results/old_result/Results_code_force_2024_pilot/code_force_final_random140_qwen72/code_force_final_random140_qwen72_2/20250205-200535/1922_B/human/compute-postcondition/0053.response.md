The code snippet `a.append(int(data[current_index]))` appends the integer conversion of the element at `data[current_index]` to the list `a`. The variables `i` and `n` are not directly modified by this code. However, the list `a` is updated, and the state of `current_index` and `data` should be considered.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` has a new element which is the integer value of `data[current_index]`**.
