Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[0]` and value `0`. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.**
