The code snippet `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by adding the current value of `i` to it. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `hashing[a[2]]` will be updated.

- Initially, `hashing[a[2]]` is 0 (since `a[2]` is not in `hashing`).
- After executing the code, `hashing[a[2]]` will be `0 + 2`, which is 2.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `hashing[a[2]]` is 2, `ans` remains unchanged.**
