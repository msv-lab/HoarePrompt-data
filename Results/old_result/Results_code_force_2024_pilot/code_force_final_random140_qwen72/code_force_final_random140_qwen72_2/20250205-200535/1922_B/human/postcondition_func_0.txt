The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function calculates a specific value for each test case based on the sorted list of integers and prints these values. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input data unchanged and resets all internal variables used for processing each test case.
