Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is 4, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing the integer value of `data[2]`, the integer value of `data[3]`, and the integer value of `data[4]`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(int(data[current_index]))` appends the integer value of `data[4]` to the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` contains the integer values of `data[2]` and `data[3]`. After the code execution, `a` now also includes the integer value of `data[4]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `current_index`, `data`, `results`, `hashing`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
