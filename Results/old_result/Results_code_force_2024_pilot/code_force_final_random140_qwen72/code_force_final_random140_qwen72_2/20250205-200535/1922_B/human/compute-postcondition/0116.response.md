The code snippet `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `hashing[a[0]]` is 0
- `hashing[a[1]]` is 1
- `ans` remains unchanged

Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. According to the initial state, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1. Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding 1 to its current value.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1.**
