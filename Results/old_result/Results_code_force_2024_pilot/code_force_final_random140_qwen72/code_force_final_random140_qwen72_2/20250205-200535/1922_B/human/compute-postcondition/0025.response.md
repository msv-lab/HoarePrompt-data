Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[0]` and value `0`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` adds the key `a[0]` (since `i` is 0) to the dictionary `hashing` with the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
