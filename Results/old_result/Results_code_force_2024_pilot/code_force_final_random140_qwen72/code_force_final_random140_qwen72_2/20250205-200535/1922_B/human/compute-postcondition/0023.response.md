To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `current_index` is `2 + n`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `results` is an empty list
- `hashing` is an empty dictionary
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `ans` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
- For the loop to execute, `range(n - 1)` must generate at least one value, which means `n - 1` must be greater than 0.
- Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0**
