Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` depending on the condition, `i` is 0 or 1, `work` is `True` or `False` based on the condition, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`. If `work` is `True`, `ans` is the first character of `a`, and if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` becomes `False`. Otherwise, `work` remains `True`, and if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include the first character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `work` is `False`, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` remains `False`.***
