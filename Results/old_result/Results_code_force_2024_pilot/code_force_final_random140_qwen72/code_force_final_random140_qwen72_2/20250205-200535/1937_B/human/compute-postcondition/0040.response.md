Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` plus `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `work` is a boolean value, `i` is less than `len(a)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` from the string `b`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `work`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is the concatenation of its previous value (which was the first character of `a` or `b` plus `a[i]`) and the character `b[i]`.
