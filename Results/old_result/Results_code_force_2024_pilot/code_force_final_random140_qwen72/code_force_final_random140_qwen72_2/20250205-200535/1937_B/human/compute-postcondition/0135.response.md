Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 2, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop broke due to `i + 1 == len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]` being true at any point, otherwise `work` is `True` or `False` based on the last iteration's condition, `j` is 2, and `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, otherwise `counter` remains as it was initially (1 or 2).***
