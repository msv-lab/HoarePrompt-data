Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` plus `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `work` is a boolean value, `i` is less than `len(a)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
