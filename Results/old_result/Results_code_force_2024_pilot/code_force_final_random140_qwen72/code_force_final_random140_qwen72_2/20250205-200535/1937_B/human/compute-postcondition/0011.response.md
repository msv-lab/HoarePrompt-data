Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is now the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True.** 

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the first character of the string `a` (since `i` is 0) to the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` was an empty string, so now it contains the first character of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
