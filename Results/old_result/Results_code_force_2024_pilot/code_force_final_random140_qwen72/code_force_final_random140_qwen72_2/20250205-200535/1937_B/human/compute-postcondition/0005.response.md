The code snippet `b = input().strip()` reads a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b` after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
