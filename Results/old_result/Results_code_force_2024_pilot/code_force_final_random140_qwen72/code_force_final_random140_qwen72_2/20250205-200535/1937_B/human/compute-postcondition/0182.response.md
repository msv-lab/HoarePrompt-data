Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by either the second character of `a` if `work` is `True` or the first character of `b` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, and now also followed by `b[i]` if `work` is `False`, and now also followed by `a[i]` if `work` is `True` or `b[i]` if `work` is `False` and `i + 1 != len(a)`. `i` is 0 or 1 if `work` is `True` and 1 or 2 if `work` is `False` when `i + 1 == len(a)`, and `i` is 1 or 2 if `work` is `True` and 2 or 3 if `work` is `False` when `i + 1 != len(a)`. `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is `True`. `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
