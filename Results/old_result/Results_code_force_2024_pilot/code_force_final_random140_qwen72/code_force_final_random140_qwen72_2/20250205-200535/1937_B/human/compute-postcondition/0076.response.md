Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`.**
