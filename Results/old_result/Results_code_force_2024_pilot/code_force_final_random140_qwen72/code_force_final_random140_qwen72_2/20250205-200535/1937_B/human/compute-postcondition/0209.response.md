The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but operates under the constraints that there are `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, there is an integer `n` such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5`, and two binary strings `a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n}` and `a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n}` of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 × 10^5`.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each containing two binary strings of length `n`, and returns a result for each test case.**
