Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is now the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` and possibly the character at index `i` of `b` (if `i + 1 == len(a)`), `i` is 0, 1, or 2, `work` is `True` or `False` based on the condition, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
