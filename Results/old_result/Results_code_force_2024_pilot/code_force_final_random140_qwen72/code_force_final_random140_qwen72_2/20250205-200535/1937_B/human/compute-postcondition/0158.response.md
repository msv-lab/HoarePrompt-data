Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions***
