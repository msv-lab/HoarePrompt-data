Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` (or the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b` if `i + 1 == len(a)`), `i` is 0 or 1, `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions. If `work` is `True`, `ans` is the first character of `a` (or the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b` if `i + 1 == len(a)`), `i` is 0 or 1, and `work` remains `True` unless `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`. If `work` is `False`, `ans` is `b[0]`, `i` is 1, and `work` remains `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by either the second character of `a` if `work` is `True` or the first character of `b` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, and now also followed by `b[i]` if `work` is `False`. `i` is 0 or 1 if `work` is `True` and 1 or 2 if `work` is `False`. `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is `True`. `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by either the second character of `a` if `work` is `True` or the first character of `b` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, and now also followed by `b[i]` if `work` is `False` and `a[i]` if `work` is `True` or `b[i]` if `work` is `False` and `i + 1 != len(a)`. `i` is 0 or 1 if `work` is `True` and 1 or 2 if `work` is `False` when `i + 1 == len(a)`, and `i` is 1 or 2 if `work` is `True` and 2 or 3 if `work` is `False` when `i + 1 != len(a)`. `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is `True`. `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
