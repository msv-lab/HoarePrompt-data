Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that combines characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop encountered a condition where `b[i] < a[i + 1]` before reaching the end of `a`, otherwise `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 1, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that combines characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop encountered a condition where `b[i] < a[i + 1]` before reaching the end of `a`, otherwise `work` is `True`, `j` is 0, and `counter` is 1. If the second character of `a` (`a[j + 1]`) is '0' and the first character of `b` (`b[j]`) is '1', these specific conditions hold true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 1, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that combines characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop encountered a condition where `b[i] < a[i + 1]` before reaching the end of `a`, otherwise `work` is `True`, `j` is 1, and `counter` is 2 if the third character of `a` (`a[j + 1]`) is '0' and the second character of `b` (`b[j]`) is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 2, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that combines characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop encountered a condition where `b[i] < a[i + 1]` before reaching the end of `a`, otherwise `work` is `True`, `j` is 2, and `counter` is 1 if the third character of `a` (`a[j + 1]`) is '0' and the second character of `b` (`b[j]`) is '1'. Otherwise, `counter` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
