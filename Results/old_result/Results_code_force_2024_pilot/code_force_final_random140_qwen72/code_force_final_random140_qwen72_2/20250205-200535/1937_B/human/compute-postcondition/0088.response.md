Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is now the first character of `a`, `i` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`. If `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include the first character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 1, and the condition that either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` still holds.***
