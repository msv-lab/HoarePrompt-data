Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 1, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop broke due to `i + 1 == len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]` being true at any point, otherwise `work` is `True` or `False` based on the last iteration's condition, `j` is 1, and `counter` is 2 if the third character of `a` (`a[j + 1]`) is equal to the second character of `b` (`b[j]`), otherwise `counter` remains 1 if it was initially 1, or becomes 3 if it was initially 2.***
