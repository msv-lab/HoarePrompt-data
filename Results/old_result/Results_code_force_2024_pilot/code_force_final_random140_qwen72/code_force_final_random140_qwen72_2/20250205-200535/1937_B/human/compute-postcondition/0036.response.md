Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` depending on the conditions. If `work` is `True`, `ans` is updated to include the character at index `i` of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` becomes `False`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` includes the character at index `i` of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `i + 1 < len(a)`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains as the first character of `a` or `b` plus the character at index `i-1` of `a`. If `work` is `False`, `ans` is updated to include the character `b[i-1]`, and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `a`.***
