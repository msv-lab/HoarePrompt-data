Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop broke due to `i + 1 == len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]` being true at any point, otherwise `work` is `True` or `False` based on the last iteration's condition, `j` is 0, and `counter` is 2 if the second character of `a` (`a[j + 1]`) is equal to the first character of `b` (`b[j]`). Additionally, the second character of `a` (`a[j + 1]`) is '0' and the first character of `b` (`b[j]`) is '1'.**
