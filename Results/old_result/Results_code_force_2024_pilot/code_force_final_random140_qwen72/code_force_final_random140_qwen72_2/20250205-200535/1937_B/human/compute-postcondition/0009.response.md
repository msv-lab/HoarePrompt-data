To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `i < len(a)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i < len(a)`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop will execute if `len(a) > 0`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 0. This means `a` must be a non-empty string.

### Conclusion:
The state of `a` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is a non-empty string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`) do not affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True**
