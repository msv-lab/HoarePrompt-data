You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b` of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by interleaving characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions. It then prints the constructed string `ans`. Additionally, it calculates and prints a counter value that reflects the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` under certain conditions. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, and the two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Constructing the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The function initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It uses a boolean variable `work` to decide whether to take characters from `a` or `b`.
   - The loop iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
     - If the next character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`, it switches to taking characters from `b` (sets `work` to `False`).
     - If the end of the string is reached, it appends the last character from `b` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it moves to the next character in `a`.
   - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` to `ans` and moves to the next character.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The function initializes a counter `counter` to 1.
   - It iterates through the characters of `a` and `b` up to the second-to-last character:
     - If the next character in `a` matches the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
   - Finally, it prints the counter.

### Analysis:

- **Lexicographically Smallest String**:
  - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct. It ensures that the path taken is the one that results in the smallest possible string by comparing the next characters in `a` and `b`.

- **Counting the Number of Paths**:
  - The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is also correct. It correctly identifies when the path can switch between `a` and `b` and counts the number of such switches.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of paths that yield this string. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
