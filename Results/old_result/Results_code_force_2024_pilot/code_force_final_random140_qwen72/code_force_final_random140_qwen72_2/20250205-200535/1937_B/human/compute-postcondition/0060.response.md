Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is either `True` or `False` depending on the last iteration's condition, `j` is 1, and if the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 2. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2 or 3.***
