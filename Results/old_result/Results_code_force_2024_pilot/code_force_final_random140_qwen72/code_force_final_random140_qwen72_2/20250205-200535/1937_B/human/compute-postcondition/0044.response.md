Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than or equal to `len(a)`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is False. Otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` plus either `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, or `a[i-1]` otherwise. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
