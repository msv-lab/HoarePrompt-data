Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions. Additionally, `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.**
