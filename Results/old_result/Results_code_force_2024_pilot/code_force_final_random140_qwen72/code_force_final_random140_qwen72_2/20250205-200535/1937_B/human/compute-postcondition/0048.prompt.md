Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` depending on the conditions. If `work` is True, `ans` is the first character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` remains True, and `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`; otherwise, `ans` is just the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `i` is 0; otherwise, `i` is 1. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` depending on the conditions. If `work` is `True`, `ans` is updated to include the character at index `i` of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` becomes `False`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` includes the character at index `i` of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `i + 1 < len(a)`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains as the first character of `a` or `b` plus the character at index `i-1` of `a`. If `work` is `False`, `ans` is updated to include the character `b[i-1]`, and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than or equal to `len(a)`. If `work` is True, and `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` becomes False. Otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` plus either `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, or `a[i-1]` otherwise. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` followed by `b[i-1]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
