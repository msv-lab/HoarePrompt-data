Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that combines characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop encountered a condition where `b[i] < a[i + 1]` before reaching the end of `a`, otherwise `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is 1.**
