Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
- `ans1` contains all elements of `l`: This means `ans1` is a list that has the same elements as `l`.
- `ans2` contains all elements of `l`: Similarly, `ans2` is also a list that has the same elements as `l`.
- `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `l`: This means `k` is modified based on the number of consecutive equal elements in `l`.
- If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop terminates early: This indicates that the loop stops if `k` becomes 0.
- The list `l` remains unchanged: This means the original list `l` is not modified during the process.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print all elements of the list `ans1`.
- Since `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, the `print` statement will print all elements of `l` separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output all elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

Output: **all elements of l separated by spaces**
