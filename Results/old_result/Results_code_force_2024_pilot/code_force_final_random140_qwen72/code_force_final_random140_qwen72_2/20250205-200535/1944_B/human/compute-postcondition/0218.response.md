Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b[2] == b[1]`, `ans1` now contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` now includes the element `b[1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
