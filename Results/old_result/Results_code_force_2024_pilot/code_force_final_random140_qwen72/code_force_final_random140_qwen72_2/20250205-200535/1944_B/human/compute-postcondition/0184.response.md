Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `len(l) - 1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
- `ans1` contains all elements of `l`.
- `ans2` also contains all elements of `l`.
- `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `l`, but this does not affect the contents of `ans2`.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.

Given that `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, the `print(*ans2)` statement will print all elements of `ans2` separated by spaces.

Output: **all elements of l separated by spaces**
