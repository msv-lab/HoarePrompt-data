The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that if `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is updated to 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is now `2 * k - 2`, the new value of `sz` will be 4. The condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is no longer satisfied because `2 * k - 4` is less than 2.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `ldb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, `sz` is 4, and `2 * k - sz` is now `2 * k - 4`.**
