Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋), and a list a of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[i - 1])
    if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0 or less, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less, `ans2` contains pairs of elements from `c` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less, `l` has been fully iterated over, and `i` is the length of `l`. If `k` is 0, the loop terminates early.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, and `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `l`. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop terminates early. The list `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is a list containing all elements of `l`, `ans2` is a list containing all elements of `l`, and `k` is 0 if the loop did not break early.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
