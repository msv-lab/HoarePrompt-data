Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0 at any point, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i - 1]` is checked for presence in `ans1`; if not present, `l` now includes the element `b[i - 1]`.***
