To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `rdb` contains at least zero elements
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `sz` remain unchanged

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses the variable `elem` twice.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

2. **Value of `elem`:**
   - The initial state does not provide any explicit value for `elem`.
   - Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, it must be defined somewhere else in the code that is not shown here.
   - Without knowing the value of `elem`, we cannot determine its exact value.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and followed by a space at the end.

### Conclusion:
Given that the value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem **

This means the output will be the value of `elem` repeated twice, followed by a space.
