Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element
- `sz` is 0
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged
- `ldb` must have at least one element
- `elem` is the first element in `ldb`
- The current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`.
- The `print` statement will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (because `end=' '`).

### Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the first element in ldb)**
