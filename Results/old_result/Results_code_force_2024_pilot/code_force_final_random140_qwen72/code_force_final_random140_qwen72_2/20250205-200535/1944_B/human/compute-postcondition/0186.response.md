Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `l`, `q` is `t`, `t` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`.
- The values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the input provided by the user.
