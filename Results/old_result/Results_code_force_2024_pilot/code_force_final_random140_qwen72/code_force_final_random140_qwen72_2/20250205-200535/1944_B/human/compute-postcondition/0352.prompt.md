Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    if lft[0] != lft[1]:
        sng.append(lft[0])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
        else:
            break
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= 2 * k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
        else:
            break
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= 2 * k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` has been iterated through up to the point where `sz` is no longer less than `2 * k`. `sz` is now the total number of elements printed, which is a multiple of 2 and is the largest even number less than or equal to `2 * k`. The loop has stopped either because `sz` reached `2 * k` or because there are no more elements left in `sng`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `rdb`, `lft`, `rgt`, `k`, `ldb`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is increased by the number of iterations until `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k` or until there are no more elements in `sng` to iterate over. The loop will stop if `2 * k - sz < 2` or if `sng` is exhausted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2) + min(2 * k - min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2), len(sng))`, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
