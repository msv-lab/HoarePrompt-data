Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `len(l) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `l`.
- `ans1` is a list containing all elements of `l`.
- `ans2` is a list containing all elements of `l`.
- `k` is 0 if the loop did not break early.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(*ans2)
```

### Explanation:
- The `*` operator in the `print` function is used to unpack the elements of the list `ans2`.
- Since `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, the `print` statement will print all elements of `l` separated by spaces.

### Output:
Output: **all elements of l separated by spaces**

For example, if `l` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 3 4**
