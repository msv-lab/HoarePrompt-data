Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now includes the element `b[i]` at the current index `i`. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` now includes the element `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
