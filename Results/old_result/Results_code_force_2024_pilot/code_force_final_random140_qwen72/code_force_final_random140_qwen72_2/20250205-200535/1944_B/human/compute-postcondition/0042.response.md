Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains the elements `b[1]` and `b[1]` if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `i` is 3, `b[i]` is either equal to or not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0 if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, `l` contains `b[1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, and `l` now also contains `b[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`.
- Since `i` is 3, `b[i - 1]` is `b[2]`.
- Therefore, `l` now contains `b[2]` in addition to its previous contents.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
