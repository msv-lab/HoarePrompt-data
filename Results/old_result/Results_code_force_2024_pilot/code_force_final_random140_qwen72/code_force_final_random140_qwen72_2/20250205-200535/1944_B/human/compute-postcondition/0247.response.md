The value of `k` is decremented by 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[i_prev + 1]` and `c[i_prev + 1]`, `k` is `k - 2`, and if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
