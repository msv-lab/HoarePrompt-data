To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `q` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is 0 or less.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list.
- `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less.
- `ans2` contains pairs of elements from `c` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less.
- `l` has been fully iterated over.
- `i` is the length of `l`.
- If `k` is 0, the loop terminates early.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This is the original list of integers.
2. **List `b`**: This is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `a`.
3. **List `c`**: This is a sorted list of the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list.
4. **Variable `k`**: This is 0 or less, which means it is non-positive.
5. **Variable `ans2`**: This list contains pairs of elements from `c` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less.

Given that `k` is 0 or less, the loop that processes `c` will terminate immediately because `k` is already 0 or less. Therefore, no pairs of consecutive elements from `c` will be added to `ans2`.

Since `l` has been fully iterated over, and `k` is 0 or less, `ans2` will only contain the elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less. However, since `k` is 0 or less from the start, no elements from `l` would have been processed, and thus `ans2` will be empty.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans2)` statement will print nothing because `ans2` is an empty list.

Output: **(empty output)**
