Output State: **`i` is incremented to 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, `k` is 0, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[2]` and `c[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `c` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is already incremented to 2, the element `c[2]` is appended to `ans2` again. Therefore, `ans2` now includes the element `c[2]` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
