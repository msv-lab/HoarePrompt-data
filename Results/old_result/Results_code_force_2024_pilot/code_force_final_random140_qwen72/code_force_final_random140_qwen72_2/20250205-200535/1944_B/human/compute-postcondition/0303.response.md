The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one more element to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` was the first element of `sng`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` should now be the second element of `sng`, and `sng` must still contain at least one more element after the current `elem`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus 1, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` must be an iterable containing at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of `sng`.**
