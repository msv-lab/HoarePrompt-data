Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and then iterating through each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`, and the list `a`.

2. **Splitting and Sorting**: The function splits the list `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`, and sorts both halves. This is necessary to ensure that we can easily find pairs of equal elements.

3. **Pair Selection**: The function attempts to select pairs of equal elements from the sorted halves `b` and `c` to form the lists `ans1` and `ans2`. This is done by iterating through the sorted lists and checking for consecutive equal elements. If such pairs are found, they are added to `ans1` and `ans2`, and `k` is decremented by 2.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements**: If there are still elements left to be added to `ans1` and `ans2` after pairing equal elements, the function uses a list `l` to store unpaired elements from `b` and then adds these elements to both `ans1` and `ans2` to ensure that the lengths of `ans1` and `ans2` are both `2k`.

5. **Output**: The function correctly prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that there will always be enough pairs of equal elements to fill `ans1` and `ans2` with `2k` elements. While the problem statement guarantees that at least one solution exists, the function should handle cases where the pairs are not immediately available by ensuring that the remaining elements are correctly distributed.

- **Efficiency**: The function could be optimized to avoid unnecessary sorting and repeated checks for equal elements, but for the given constraints, the current approach is likely sufficient.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
