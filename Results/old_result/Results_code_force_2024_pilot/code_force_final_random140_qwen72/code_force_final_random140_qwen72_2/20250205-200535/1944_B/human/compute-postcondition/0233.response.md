To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. This is because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The initial state given is `i` is `n-1`. However, this is not relevant to the loop head, as `i` will be reset to 1 when the loop starts.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.
   - The variable `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
