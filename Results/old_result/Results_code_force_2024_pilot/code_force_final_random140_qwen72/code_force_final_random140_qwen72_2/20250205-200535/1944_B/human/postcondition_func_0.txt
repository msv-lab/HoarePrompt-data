The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it splits the list `a` into two halves, sorts both halves, and then selects pairs of equal elements from these halves to form two lists `ans1` and `ans2`. The function ensures that each selected pair contributes to reducing the value of `k` by 2 until `k` reaches 0 or fewer. Any remaining elements that were not paired are also added to `ans1` and `ans2`. Finally, the function prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the final state of the program reflecting the last test case processed.
