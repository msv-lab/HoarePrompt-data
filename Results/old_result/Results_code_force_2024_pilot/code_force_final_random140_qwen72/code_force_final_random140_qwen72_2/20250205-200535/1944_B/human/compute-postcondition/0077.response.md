Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0 or less, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, `ans2` contains pairs of elements from `c` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, `l` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
