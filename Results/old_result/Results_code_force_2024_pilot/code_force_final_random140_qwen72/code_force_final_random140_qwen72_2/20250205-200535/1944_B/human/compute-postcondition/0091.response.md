To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to this point:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `q` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is 0 or less.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list.
   - `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less.
   - `ans2` contains pairs of elements from `c` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less.
   - `l` has been fully iterated over.
   - `i` is the length of `l`.
   - If `k` is 0, the loop terminates early.

2. **Understanding `ans1`:**
   - `ans1` is constructed by iterating over the sorted list `b` and collecting pairs of consecutive elements that are equal.
   - The iteration stops when `k` reaches 0 or less.
   - Additionally, `ans1` includes all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of `ans1` separated by spaces.
   - Since `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` and possibly some elements from `l`, the output will reflect these elements.

Given the initial state and the construction of `ans1`, the output will be the elements of `ans1` as described. However, without the specific values of `a`, `n`, and `k`, we cannot provide the exact numerical values. We can only describe the structure of the output.

Output: **elements of ans1 (where ans1 contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from the first n elements of the sorted list b, and possibly some elements from l that were processed before k became 0 or less)**
