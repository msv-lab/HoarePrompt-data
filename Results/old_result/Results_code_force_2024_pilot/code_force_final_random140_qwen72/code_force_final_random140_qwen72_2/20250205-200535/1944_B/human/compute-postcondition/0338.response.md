Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
- `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2)`.
- `ldb` has been fully iterated over.
- `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`elem`**: This variable is described as the next element in `sng`. Since `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over, `elem` will be the next element in this sequence.
2. **`end=' '`**: This parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

### Output:
The print statement will print the next element in the `sng` sequence followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the sng sequence)**
