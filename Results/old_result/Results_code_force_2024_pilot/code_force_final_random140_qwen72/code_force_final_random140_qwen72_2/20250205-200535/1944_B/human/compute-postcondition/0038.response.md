The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` adds the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (unchanged).
- `q` is 0 (unchanged).
- `n` is greater than 3 (unchanged).
- `a` is a list of integers from the input (unchanged).
- `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` (unchanged).
- `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list (unchanged).
- `ans1` initially contains the elements `b[1]` and `b[1]` if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list. After the code snippet, `ans1` will contain the elements it previously had plus `b[i]`.
- `ans2` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `req` is 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is 3 (unchanged).
- `b[i]` is either equal to or not equal to `b[i - 1]` (unchanged).

If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2 and `ans1` contains `b[1]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]`. After the code snippet, `ans1` will contain `b[1]`, `b[1]`, `b[2]`, and `b[3]`.

If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0, and if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains `b[1]`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged. After the code snippet, `ans1` will contain `b[1]` and `b[3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains the elements it previously had plus `b[3]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `i` is 3, and `b[i]` is either equal to or not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2 and `ans1` contains `b[1]`, `b[1]`, `b[2]`, and `b[3]`. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0, and if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains `b[1]`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.**
