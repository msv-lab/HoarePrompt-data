Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[i_prev + 1]` and `c[i_prev + 1]`, `k` is `k - 2`, and if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `ans2` or `k`.***
