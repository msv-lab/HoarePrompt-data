Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or there are no more consecutive equal elements, `k` is now `req`, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not part of any consecutive equal pairs. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is included in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and the variable `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[i]` twice, and `k` is decreased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[i_prev + 1]` and `c[i_prev + 1]`, `k` is `k - 2`, and if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `ans2` or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[i_prev + 1]` and `c[i_prev + 1]`, and `k` is `k - 4`. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the element `c[i]`, and `k` is `k - 2`. Regardless of the condition, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
