Postcondition: ***`k` is now equal to `req - 2` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains equal to `req`. `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans1` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the values of `c[1]` and `c[1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
