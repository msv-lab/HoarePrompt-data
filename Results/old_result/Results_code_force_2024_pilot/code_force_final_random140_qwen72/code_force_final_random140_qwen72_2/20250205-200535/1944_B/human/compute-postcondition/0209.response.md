Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `k` is decreased by 2, `ans1` now contains the value of `b[1]`, and the value of `b[1]` has been appended to `ans1`. If `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0]` and `k` is 0, `b[0]` is added to `l` if it is not already present in `ans1`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.***
