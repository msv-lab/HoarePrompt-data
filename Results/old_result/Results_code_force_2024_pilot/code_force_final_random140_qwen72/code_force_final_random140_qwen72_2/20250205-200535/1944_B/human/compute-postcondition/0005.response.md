The code snippet `c = a[n:]` assigns to `c` the sublist of `a` starting from the element at index `n` to the end of the list. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list.**
