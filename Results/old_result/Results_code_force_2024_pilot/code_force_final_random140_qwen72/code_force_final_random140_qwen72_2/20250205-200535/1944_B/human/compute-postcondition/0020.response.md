The value of `k` is decremented by 2. The initial value of `k` was 0, so after the operation, `k` becomes -2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains the elements `b[1]` and `b[1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.**
