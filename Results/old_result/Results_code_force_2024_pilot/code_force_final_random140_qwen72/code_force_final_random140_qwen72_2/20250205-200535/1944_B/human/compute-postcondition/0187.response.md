Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `l`, `q` is `t`, `t` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, `q`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
