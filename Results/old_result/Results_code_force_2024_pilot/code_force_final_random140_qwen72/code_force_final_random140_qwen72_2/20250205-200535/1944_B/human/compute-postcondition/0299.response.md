Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb`, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` must be an iterable containing at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
