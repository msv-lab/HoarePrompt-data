Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or there are no more consecutive equal elements, `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not part of any consecutive equal pairs, and the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is now included in `l`.**
