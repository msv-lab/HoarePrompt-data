Postcondition: ***The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and the variable `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[i]` twice, and `k` is decreased by 2.***
