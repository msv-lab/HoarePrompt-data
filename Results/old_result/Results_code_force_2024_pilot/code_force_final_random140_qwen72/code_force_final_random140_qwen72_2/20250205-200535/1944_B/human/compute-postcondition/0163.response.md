Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `c[3] == c[2]`, `ans2` contains the elements at index 3 and index 3 of `c`, and `k` is reduced by 2. If `k` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged and `k` remains the same.***
