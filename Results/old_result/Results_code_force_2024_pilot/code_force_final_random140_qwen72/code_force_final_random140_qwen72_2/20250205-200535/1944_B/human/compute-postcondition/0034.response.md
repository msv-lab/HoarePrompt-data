Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains the elements `b[1]` and `b[1]` if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `i` is 2, and `b[i]` is either equal to or not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2 and `ans1` contains `b[1]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]`. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0, and if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains `b[1]`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.***
