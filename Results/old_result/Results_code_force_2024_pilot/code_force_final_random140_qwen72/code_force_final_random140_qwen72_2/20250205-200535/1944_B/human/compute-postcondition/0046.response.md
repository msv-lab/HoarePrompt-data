Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0 (or less than 0 if it was decremented more times), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` contains elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique in the sequence, `i` is the last index of `b` that was processed before the loop terminated, and the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`) is not in `ans1`.**
