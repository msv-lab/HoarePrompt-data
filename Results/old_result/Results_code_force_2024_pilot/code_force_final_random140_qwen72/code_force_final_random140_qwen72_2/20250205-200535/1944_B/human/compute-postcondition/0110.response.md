The value of `b[i]` is appended to the list `ans1`. The current value of `b[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i - 1]`. The conditions regarding `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `b[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i - 1]`. `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]`.**
