The code snippet `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) from the list `l` to the list `ans2`.

- `i` remains 2.
- `l` still has at least three elements.
- `ans1` still contains the first three elements of `l`.
- `ans2` now contains the first two elements of `l` plus the element at index 2 of `l`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 2, `l` has at least three elements, `ans1` contains the first three elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first three elements of `l` (the first two elements plus the third element).**
