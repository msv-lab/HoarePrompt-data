Output State: **The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and the variable `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`. `ans2` now includes the value of `c[i]` twice. `k` is decreased by 2.**
