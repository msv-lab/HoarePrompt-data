Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 2 times the original value of `k`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `req` is assigned the value of `k`.
- Since `k` was already defined as 2 times its original value, `req` now holds the value of 2 times the original value of `k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
