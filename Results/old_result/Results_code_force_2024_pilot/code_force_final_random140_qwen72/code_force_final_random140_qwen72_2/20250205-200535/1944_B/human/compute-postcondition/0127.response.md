The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 again.
- `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.**
