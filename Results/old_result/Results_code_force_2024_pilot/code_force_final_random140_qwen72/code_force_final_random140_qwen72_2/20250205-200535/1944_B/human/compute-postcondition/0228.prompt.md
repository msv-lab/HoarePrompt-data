Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * (initial k - 2 * number_of_consecutive_equal_pairs_found_in_l)`, `q` is `t`, `t` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, and `c` is now sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (initial k - 2 * number_of_consecutive_equal_pairs_found_in_l)`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `k` is decreased by 2, `ans1` now contains the value of `b[1]`, and the value of `b[1]` has been appended to `ans1`. If `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0]` and `k` is 0, `b[0]` is added to `l` if it is not already present in `ans1`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b[2] == b[1]`, `ans1` now contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` now includes the element `b[1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans1` contains elements, `k` is decreased, and `l` includes elements. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now includes elements including `b[3]` and `b[3]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[2]` is not in `ans1`, `l` also includes the element `b[2]`. If `k` is 0 at any point, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
