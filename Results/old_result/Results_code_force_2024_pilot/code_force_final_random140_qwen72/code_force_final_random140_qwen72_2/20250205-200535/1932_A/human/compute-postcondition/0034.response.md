Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0, `ret` is 0 if `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is 2 if `i` is '@', and `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*'.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `thorn` is set to 0.
- The value of `i` is checked against the conditions:
  - If `i` is '@', `ret` is set to 2 and `thorn` is set to 0.
  - If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1.
  - If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is set to 0 and `thorn` remains 0.
- No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
