To determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **_ is 2**: This variable `_` is set to 2, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**: This variable `t` is an integer within the specified range, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
3. **len is an input integer**: This variable `len` represents the length of the input string, but it is not directly used in the `print` statement.
4. **s is a list of characters from the input string**: This variable `s` is a list of characters derived from an input string.
5. **ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character**: This variable `ret` counts the number of '@' characters found in the list `s` before the second '*' character is encountered.
6. **thorn is 0 or 1 (depending on whether the loop broke due to encountering the second '*' character)**: This variable `thorn` indicates whether the loop broke because it encountered the second '*' character. However, it is not used in the `print` statement.

Given this information, the `print(ret)` statement will print the value of `ret`, which is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character in the list `s`.

Output: **ret (where ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character in the list s)**
