Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, ret is 0, thorn is 1, and i is '*', which means i is not '@'. If thorn is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
