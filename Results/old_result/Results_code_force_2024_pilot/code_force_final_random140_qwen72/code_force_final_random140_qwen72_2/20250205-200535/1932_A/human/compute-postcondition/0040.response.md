Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in `s` before the second '*' character (or the total number of '@' characters if there is no second '*' character), `thorn` is 0 if the loop did not break due to the second '*', otherwise `thorn` is 2.** 

The value of `len` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
