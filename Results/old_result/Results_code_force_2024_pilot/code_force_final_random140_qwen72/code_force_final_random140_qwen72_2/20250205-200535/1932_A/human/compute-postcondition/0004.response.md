Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0.** 

The variable `thorn` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `thorn`.
