Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, and i is the second character in the list s. If i is '@', thorn is 0 and ret is increased by 1. If i is '*', thorn is incremented by 1, and if thorn reaches 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If i is neither '@' nor '*', thorn is set to 0.**
