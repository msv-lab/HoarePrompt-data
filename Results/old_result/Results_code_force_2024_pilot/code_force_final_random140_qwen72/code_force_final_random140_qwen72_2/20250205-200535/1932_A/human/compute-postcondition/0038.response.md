To determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant).
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This variable is also not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant).
   - `len` is an input integer (This variable is not directly used in the print statement, but it might affect the length of the list `s`).
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `ret` is the number of '@' characters in `s` before the second '*' character (or the total number of '@' characters if there is no second '*' character).
   - `thorn` is 0 if the loop did not break due to the second '*', otherwise `thorn` is 2 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant).

2. **Determine the Value of `ret`:**
   - `ret` is calculated based on the number of '@' characters in the list `s` before the second '*' character.
   - If there is no second '*' character, `ret` is the total number of '@' characters in the list `s`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(ret)` statement will print the value of `ret`, which is the number of '@' characters in the list `s` before the second '*' character, or the total number of '@' characters if there is no second '*' character.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **ret (where ret is the number of '@' characters in the list s before the second '*' character, or the total number of '@' characters if there is no second '*' character)**
