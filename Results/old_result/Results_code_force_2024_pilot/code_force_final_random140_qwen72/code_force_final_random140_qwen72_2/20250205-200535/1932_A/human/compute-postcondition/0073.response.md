Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 2. If `i` is '*', `ret` is 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '*' nor '@', `ret` is 0.**
