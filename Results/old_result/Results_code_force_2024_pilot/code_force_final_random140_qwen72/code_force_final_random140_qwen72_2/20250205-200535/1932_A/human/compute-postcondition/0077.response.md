To determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic described:

1. **_**: This variable is set to 1. It is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it.
2. **t**: This is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). It is also not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it.
3. **len**: This is an input integer representing the length of the list `s`.
4. **s**: This is a list of characters from the input string.
5. **ret**: This variable counts the number of '@' characters encountered before the second consecutive '*' character (or the end of the list).
6. **thorn**: This variable is set to 0 if the loop did not encounter two consecutive '*' characters; otherwise, it is set to 2. However, `thorn` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it.

Given the initial state, the `print(ret)` statement will print the value of `ret`, which is the count of '@' characters encountered before the second consecutive '*' character (or the end of the list).

Since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of '@' characters as described.

Output: **ret (where ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second consecutive '*' character or the end of the list)**
