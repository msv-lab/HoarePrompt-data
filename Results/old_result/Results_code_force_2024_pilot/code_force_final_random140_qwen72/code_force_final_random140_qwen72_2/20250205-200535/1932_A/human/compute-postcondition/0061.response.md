The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `thorn` depends on the value of `i` (the second character in the list `s`). If `i` is '@', `thorn` was initially 0, so it becomes 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` was initially 1, so it becomes 2. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` was initially 0, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 2. Otherwise, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1.**
