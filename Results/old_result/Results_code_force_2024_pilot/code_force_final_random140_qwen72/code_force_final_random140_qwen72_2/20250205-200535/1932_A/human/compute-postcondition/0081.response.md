Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string, ret is 0, thorn is 0 if the loop did not encounter two consecutive '*' characters, otherwise thorn is 2.** 

The value of `ret` is set to 0, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions for `thorn` remain the same as specified in the initial state.
