Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s` and `i` is equal to '@', `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0**

The code snippet `thorn = 0` does not change the value of `thorn` since it was already initialized to 0 in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
