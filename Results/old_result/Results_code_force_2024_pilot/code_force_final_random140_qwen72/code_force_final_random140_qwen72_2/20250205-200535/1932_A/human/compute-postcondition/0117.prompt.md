Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the path. The path is represented by a string of n characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of the path is always empty ('.').
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn = 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in `s` before the second '*' character (or the total number of '@' characters if there is no second '*' character), `thorn` is 0 if the loop did not break due to the second '*', otherwise `thorn` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string, ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second consecutive '*' character (or the end of the list), thorn is 0 if the loop did not encounter two consecutive '*' characters, otherwise thorn is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string, ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character, thorn is 0 or 1 (depending on whether the loop broke due to encountering the second '*' character).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
