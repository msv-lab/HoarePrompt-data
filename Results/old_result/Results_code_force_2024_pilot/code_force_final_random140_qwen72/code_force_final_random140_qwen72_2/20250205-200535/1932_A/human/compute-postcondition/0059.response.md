Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0. Otherwise, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The line `thorn = 0` explicitly sets `thorn` to 0.
- Since `thorn` was already set to 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `len`, `s`, `i`, `ret`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
