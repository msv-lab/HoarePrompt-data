The code snippet updates the value of `mod_y` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. Let's go through the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least three test cases.
   - `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it.
   - `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case.
   - `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case.
   - `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case.
   - `a` must have at least three elements.
   - `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` with `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` now equal to 2.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `num` is the third element of `a`.
   - If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 1 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `mod_y = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least three test cases.
   - `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it.
   - `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case.
   - `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case.
   - `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case.
   - `a` must have at least three elements.
   - `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` with `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` now equal to 2.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is now `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `num` is the third element of `a`.
   - If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 1 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` must have at least three elements, `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` with `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` now equal to 2, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is now `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the third element of `a`, if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 1 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2, otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2.**
