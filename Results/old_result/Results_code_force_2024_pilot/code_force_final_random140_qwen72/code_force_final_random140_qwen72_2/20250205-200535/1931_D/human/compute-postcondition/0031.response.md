Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least one test case, `case` is the first test case in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list with `n` elements, `freq` is a defaultdict where each key `(mod_x, mod_y)` corresponds to the count of numbers in `a` that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[j] + y` is divisible by `y`.**
