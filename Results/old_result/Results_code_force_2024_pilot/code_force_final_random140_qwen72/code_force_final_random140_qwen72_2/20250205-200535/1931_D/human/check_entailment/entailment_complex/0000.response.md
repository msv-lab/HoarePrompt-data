Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\), followed by the array \(a\).

2. **Algorithm:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\).
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders \((\text{required\_mod}_x, \text{required\_mod}_y)\) that would form a beautiful pair with the current element.
   - It checks if the required remainders have been seen before and increments the count of beautiful pairs accordingly.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency of the current element's remainders.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the count of beautiful pairs for each test case and prints the results.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as described.
- The logic for calculating the required remainders and checking for beautiful pairs is sound.
- The use of a `defaultdict` ensures efficient counting of pairs.
- The program adheres to the constraints and produces the expected output for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
