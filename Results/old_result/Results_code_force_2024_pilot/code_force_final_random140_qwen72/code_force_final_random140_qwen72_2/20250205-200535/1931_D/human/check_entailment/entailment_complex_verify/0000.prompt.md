You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each value in `results` represents the total count of pairs of elements in the corresponding test case's list `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` where each test case is a dictionary containing a tuple of three integers (`n`, `x`, `y`) and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to count the number of pairs of elements in the list such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`. It returns a list `results` containing the count of such pairs for each test case. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is fully processed, and `results` contains the final counts for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` based on the given conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary**: A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(num % x, num % y)` for each element in the array. This helps in efficiently counting the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Beautiful Pair Calculation**:
   - For each element `num` in the array, the program calculates `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
   - It then determines the required values `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y = mod_y` such that the sum and difference conditions are met.
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. It correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case, ensuring that the conditions for divisibility by `x` and `y` are met. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
