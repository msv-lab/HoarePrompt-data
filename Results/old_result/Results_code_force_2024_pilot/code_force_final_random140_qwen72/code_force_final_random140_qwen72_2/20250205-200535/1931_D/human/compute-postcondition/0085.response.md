Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` must have at least two elements, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the second element of `a`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 1 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 1. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 1.***
