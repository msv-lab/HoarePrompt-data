To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least two test cases
- `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing the value of `beautiful_count`
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the second test case
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the second test case
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the second test case
- `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the second test case
- `freq` is an empty defaultdict(int)
- `beautiful_count` is 0

### Loop Head:
```python
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves iterating over the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.
- The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- The other variables remain as they are.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least two test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the second test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the second test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the second test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the second test case and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty defaultdict(int), `beautiful_count` is 0**
