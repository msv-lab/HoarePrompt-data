Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` is a list of integers, `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the frequency of pairs of remainders when elements of `a` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs of elements in `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The list `test_cases` still contains at least three test cases, and `case` is the third test case in this list.
- The list `results` now contains the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it.
- The variable `n` is the first parameter of the third test case.
- The variables `x` and `y` are the second and third parameters of the third test case, respectively.
- The list `a` is a list of integers from the third test case.
- The `freq` dictionary now contains the frequency of each pair of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` for all elements in `a`.
- The variable `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs of elements in `a` where the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.
