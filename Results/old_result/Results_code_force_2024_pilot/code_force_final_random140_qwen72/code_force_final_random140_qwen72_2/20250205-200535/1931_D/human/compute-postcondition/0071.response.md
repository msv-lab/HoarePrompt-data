The code snippet provided calculates the remainder of `num` when divided by `x` and assigns this value to `mod_x`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` should be `n` (as it is the only numerical variable mentioned in the context of the third test case), the calculation would be `mod_x = n % x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases
- `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case
- `a` must have at least one element
- `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0

After executing the code:
- `mod_x` is calculated as `n % x`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases
- `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case
- `a` must have at least one element
- `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0
- `mod_x` is `n % x`

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` must have at least one element, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`.**
