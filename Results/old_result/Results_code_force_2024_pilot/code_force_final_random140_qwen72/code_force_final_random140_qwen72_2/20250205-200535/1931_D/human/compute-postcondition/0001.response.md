To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

1. **`test_cases`**: This is a list of test cases. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one test case.
2. **`case`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop. Initially, it should be set to the first element of `test_cases`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case in `test_cases` is a tuple containing three integers n, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop can execute, `test_cases` must have at least one test case, and `case` should be the first test case in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least one test case, `case` is the first test case in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
