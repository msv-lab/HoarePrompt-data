Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least two test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the second test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the second test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the second test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the second test case and must have at least two elements, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `num` is the second element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `required_mod_x` to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new value of `required_mod_x` is calculated based on the current value of `mod_x` and `x`.
- The value of `mod_x` is `num % x`, and `mod_y` is `num % y`, where `num` is the second element of `a`.
- The rest of the state remains the same as described in the initial state.
