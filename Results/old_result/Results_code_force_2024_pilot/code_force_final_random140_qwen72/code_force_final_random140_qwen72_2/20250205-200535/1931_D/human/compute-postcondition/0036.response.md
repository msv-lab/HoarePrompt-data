Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least two test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the second test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the second test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the second test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the second test case, `freq` is an empty defaultdict(int), `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[j] + y` is divisible by `y` for the second test case.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `freq` as an empty `defaultdict(int)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `beautiful_count`) retain their initial values or relationships as described in the initial state.
