The only objects in the loop head are the variables `case` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `test_cases`. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least one test case, and `case` is the first test case in `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least two test cases, and `case` should now refer to the second test case in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least two test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the second test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the second test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the second test case, `a` is a list with `n` elements for the second test case, `freq` is a defaultdict where each key `(mod_x, mod_y)` corresponds to the count of numbers in `a` for the second test case that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[j] + y` is divisible by `y` for the second test case.**
