The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The function collects these test cases into a list, passes them to another function `func_1`, and prints the results returned by `func_1`. After the function concludes, the input data is processed, and the results are printed to the standard output.
