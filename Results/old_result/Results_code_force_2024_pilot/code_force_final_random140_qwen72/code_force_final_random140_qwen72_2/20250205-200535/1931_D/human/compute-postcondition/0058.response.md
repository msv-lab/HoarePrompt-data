Output State: **`required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet only updates the value of `required_mod_x` to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- All other variables (`mod_y`, `mod_x`, `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `required_mod_y` is not modified by this code snippet, so it remains as `mod_y`.
- The `beautiful_count` is not incremented in this snippet, so its value remains unchanged.
- The `freq` dictionary is not modified in this snippet, so it remains as a `defaultdict(int)` with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1.
- The `a` list and `num` retain their values from the initial state.
