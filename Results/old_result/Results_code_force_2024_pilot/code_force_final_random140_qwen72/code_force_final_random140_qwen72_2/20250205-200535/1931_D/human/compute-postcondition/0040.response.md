Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least two test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the second test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the second test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the second test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the second test case and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty defaultdict(int), `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `mod_y` is assigned the value of `n % y`, which is the remainder when `n` is divided by `y`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
