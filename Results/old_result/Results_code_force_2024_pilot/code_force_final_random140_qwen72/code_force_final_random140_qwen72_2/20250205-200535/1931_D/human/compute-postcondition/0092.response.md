The code snippet updates the value of `beautiful_count` based on the frequency of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

Given the initial state:
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least three test cases
- `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case
- `a` must have at least three elements
- `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` with `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` now equal to 2
- `mod_x` is `num % x`
- `mod_y` is `num % y`
- `required_mod_y` is `num % y`
- `num` is the third element of `a`
- If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 1 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2.

The code snippet:
```python
beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
2. `required_mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
3. The tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is checked in the `freq` dictionary.
4. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, its value is added to `beautiful_count`.

Since `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2 and the problem states that if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 1, we can infer that `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is indeed in `freq` and its value is 2.

Therefore, `beautiful_count` is updated by adding 2 to its current value.

Output State: **`required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` must have at least three elements, `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` with `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` now equal to 2, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the third element of `a`, `beautiful_count` is 3, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2.**
