The value of `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value found in the dictionary `freq` at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. The values of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged, as they are used to look up the value in `freq`.

Output State: **`required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]`.**
