Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. The solution uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(num % x, num % y)` which helps in efficiently counting the beautiful pairs. The logic ensures that for each element in the array, it checks if there exists another element that, when combined with the current element, satisfies the conditions for being a beautiful pair. This approach is efficient and handles the constraints specified in the problem description.
