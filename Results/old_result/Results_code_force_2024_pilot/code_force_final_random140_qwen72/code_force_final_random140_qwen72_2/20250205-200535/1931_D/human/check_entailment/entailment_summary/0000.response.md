Reasoning:  
The provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement. However, there is a subtle issue with the logic used to identify the pairs. Specifically, the code calculates the required modulo values for a pair to be considered beautiful but does not correctly account for the condition that \(a_i - a_j\) must be divisible by \(y\). The current implementation assumes that if the modulo values match the required conditions, the pair is beautiful, which is not always true because it does not directly check the difference \(a_i - a_j\).

To fix this, the code should explicitly check both conditions for each pair of elements in the array, rather than relying solely on the frequency of modulo values. However, the current approach is efficient and works under the assumption that the modulo conditions are sufficient, which they are not in all cases.

Given the execution summary, the function appears to process the input correctly and produce outputs, but without further validation against the problem's constraints and examples, we cannot definitively say it is correct. Based on the provided information and the nature of the problem, the current implementation is likely incorrect due to the logical oversight mentioned.

Correctness: **False**
