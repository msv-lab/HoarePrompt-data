Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each value in `results` represents the total count of pairs of elements in the corresponding test case's list `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.**
