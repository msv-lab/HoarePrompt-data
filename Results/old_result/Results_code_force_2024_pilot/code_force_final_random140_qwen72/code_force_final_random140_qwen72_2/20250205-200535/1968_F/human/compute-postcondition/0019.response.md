Output State: **`a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 0, and the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`. The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and moves to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables.
- It only affects the flow of the loop, causing the current iteration to end immediately and moving to the next iteration.
- All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
