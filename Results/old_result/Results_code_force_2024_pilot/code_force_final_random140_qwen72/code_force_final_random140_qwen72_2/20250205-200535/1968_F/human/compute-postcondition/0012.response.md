The code snippet `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of the list `x` and the next integer `i` from the list `a` to the end of the list `x`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `x` initially contains the elements `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i]`.
- `i` is the next integer in the list `a`.
- The last element of `x` before the operation is `x[-1]`, which is `x[-1] ^ i`.
- The new element appended to `x` is `x[-1] ^ i`, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and `i`.

Therefore, the new list `x` will be `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i, (x[-1] ^ i) ^ i]`.

Since `x[-1]` is `x[-1] ^ i`, the new element appended is `(x[-1] ^ i) ^ i`. Using the properties of the XOR operation, `(x[-1] ^ i) ^ i` simplifies to `x[-1]`.

So, the new list `x` will be `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i, x[-1]]`.

All other variables (`a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `inds`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i, x[-1]]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing `[0]`, `inds[i_value]` containing `[1, 2]`, and `i` is the next integer in `a`.**
