Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i, x[-1]]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing `[0]`, `inds[i_value]` containing `[1, 2]`, `inds[x[-1]]` containing `[3]`, and `i` is the next integer in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`.
- Before the code executes, `x` contains `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i, x[-1]]`, so `x[-1]` is the last element of `x`, which is `x[-1]`.
- The length of `x` is 4, so `len(x) - 1` is 3.
- Therefore, `inds[x[-1]]` is updated to include the value 3.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
