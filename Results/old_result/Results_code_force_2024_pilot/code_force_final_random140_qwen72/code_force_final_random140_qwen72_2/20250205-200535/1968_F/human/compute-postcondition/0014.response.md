Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, and `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.
- For each iteration, the last element of `x` is XORed with `i` and the result is appended to `x`.
- The index of the new element in `x` is then added to the list in `inds` corresponding to the new element's value.
- After all iterations, `x` will contain the cumulative XOR results starting from 0, and `inds` will map each unique XOR result to the list of indices where it appears in `x`.
