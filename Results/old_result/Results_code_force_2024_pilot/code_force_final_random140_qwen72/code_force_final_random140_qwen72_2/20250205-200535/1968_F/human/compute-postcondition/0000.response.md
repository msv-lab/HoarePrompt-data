The function `func_1(int)` is called with an integer argument, and it returns two values that are assigned to `n` and `q`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new values of `n` and `q`. However, we know that `n` and `q` will now hold the values returned by `func_1`.

The initial constraints on `n` and `q` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) may or may not still apply depending on the implementation of `func_1`. Without further information about `func_1`, we assume that these constraints might no longer hold.

The list `a` and the variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**
