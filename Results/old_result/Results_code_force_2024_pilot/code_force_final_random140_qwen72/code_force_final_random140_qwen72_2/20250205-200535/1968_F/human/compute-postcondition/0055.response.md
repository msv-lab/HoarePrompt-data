The function `func_3` accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r`. Here, `n` and `q` are integers within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. `l` and `r` are integers within the range 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

The function processes the list `a` and the integers `l` and `r` to perform some operation (not specified in the constraints) and returns a result based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n` and `q`, a list of integers `a` of length `n`, and two integers `l` and `r`. It returns a result based on the values of `a` between indices `l` and `r`.**
