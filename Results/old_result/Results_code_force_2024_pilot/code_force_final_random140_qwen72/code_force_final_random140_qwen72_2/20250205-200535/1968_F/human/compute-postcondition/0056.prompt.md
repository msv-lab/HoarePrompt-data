You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_3():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, and `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` has been fully decremented to 0, `l` and `r` are the final values returned by `func_1(int)` during the last iteration, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is `q-1` (the total number of iterations minus one), `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`. The conditions for `upper` and `lower` will depend on the final values of `l` and `r` and whether they satisfy the conditions within the loop's if-else statements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts integers `n` and `q`, a list of integers `a` of length `n`, and two integers `l` and `r`. It returns a result based on the values of `a` between indices `l` and `r`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
