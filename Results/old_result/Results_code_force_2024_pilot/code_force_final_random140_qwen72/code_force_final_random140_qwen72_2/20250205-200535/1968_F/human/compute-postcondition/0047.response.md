Output State: **`a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 2, `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1` updates the value of `lower`.
- `lower` is set to the next index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or -1 if no such index exists.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `upper`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `if x[l - 1] == x[r]` is not affected by this code snippet, so it remains as it was in the initial state.
