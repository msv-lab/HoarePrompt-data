Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It uses a prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the XOR of subarrays and a dictionary to track indices of XOR values, which helps in determining if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The binary search function (`func_2`) is used to find suitable indices for splitting the subarray, ensuring the solution is efficient even for large inputs. The logic for checking if a subarray is "interesting" seems to be implemented correctly according to the problem's requirements.
