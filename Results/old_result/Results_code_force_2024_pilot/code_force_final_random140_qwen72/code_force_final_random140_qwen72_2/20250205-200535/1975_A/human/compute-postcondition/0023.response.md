Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `check_all` based on whether all elements in `new` (which contains elements from index 2 to the end of `a`) are less than the first element of `a`.
- The value of `check_all` is now determined by the condition specified in the code.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
