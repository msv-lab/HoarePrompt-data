The code snippet updates the value of `new_all` based on whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The condition checks each pair of consecutive elements in `new` to ensure that each element is less than or equal to the next one.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `False`
- `i` is 2
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`

The code snippet:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```

Impact of the code:
- `new_all` is updated to `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

Since the initial state already specifies that `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the code snippet essentially re-evaluates this condition and updates `new_all` accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
