### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

2. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element:**
   - If the array is not already sorted, it iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This indicates the point where the array is no longer in non-decreasing order.

3. **Splitting and Checking the Suffix:**
   - Once the first out-of-order element is found, it splits the array into two parts: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`.
   - It then checks if the suffix `a[i:]` is sorted in non-decreasing order using another `all` function with a list comprehension.
   - Additionally, it checks if all elements in the suffix `a[i:]` are less than or equal to the first element of the prefix `a[0]`.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - If both conditions are met (the suffix is sorted and all elements in the suffix are less than or equal to the first element of the prefix), it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Logical Error in Suffix Check:**
  - The condition `check_all = all([a[0] > new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` should be `check_all = all([a[0] <= new[0]])` because we need to ensure that the first element of the suffix is greater than or equal to the last element of the prefix.
  - The condition `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])` is correct for checking if the suffix is sorted.

- **Breaking the Loop:**
  - The loop breaks immediately after finding the first out-of-order element and making the decision. This is correct because once we find the first out-of-order element, we can make the decision based on the conditions.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n))
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all = a[0] <= new[0]
                    new_all = all(new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new)))
                    if check_all and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                    break
```
