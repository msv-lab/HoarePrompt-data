Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` is the same list of integers from the new user input, `i` is `n-1`, `new` is a list containing elements from index `n-1` to the end of `a`. If any element in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` is less than the element immediately before it, then either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and the program has printed 'NO' and broken out of the loop. If all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are greater than the element immediately before them, and `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the program has printed 'YES' and broken out of the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, indicating that the loop could still run if there were more iterations.
- The variable `n` retains its initial value, which is the length of the list `a` minus one.
- The list `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop, preserving the original input.
- The variable `i` reaches the value `n-1` after the loop completes all iterations.
- The list `new` is updated to contain elements from index `n-1` to the end of `a`.
- The loop checks if any element in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` is less than the element immediately before it. If such a condition is found, it sets `check_all` or `new_all` to `False` and prints 'NO', breaking out of the loop.
- If no such condition is found and the sublist `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the loop prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
