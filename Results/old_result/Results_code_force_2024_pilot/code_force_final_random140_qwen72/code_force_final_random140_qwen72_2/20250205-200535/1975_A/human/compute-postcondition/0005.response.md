Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are in strictly increasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. The current value of `check_all` is `True`.**
