To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
   - `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, or `new_all`, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
