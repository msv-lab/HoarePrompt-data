Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n-1`. If the element at index `i-1` of `a` is greater than the element at index `i` of `a`, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`.
- The list `a` remains the same as it was initially.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterates over.
- If the element at index `i-1` of `a` is greater than the element at index `i` of `a`, a new list `new` is created containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- The variable `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`; otherwise, it is `False`.
- The variable `new_all` is `True` if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it is `False`.
- The program will break out of the loop regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`.
