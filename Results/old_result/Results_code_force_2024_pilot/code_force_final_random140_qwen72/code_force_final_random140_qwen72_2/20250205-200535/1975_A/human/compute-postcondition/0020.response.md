Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 1. If the element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` (a list containing elements from index 1 to the end of `a`) are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, or if either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, or both, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
