Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new user input.
- `i` is 1.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `False`.
- Either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of them.

Output: **NO**
