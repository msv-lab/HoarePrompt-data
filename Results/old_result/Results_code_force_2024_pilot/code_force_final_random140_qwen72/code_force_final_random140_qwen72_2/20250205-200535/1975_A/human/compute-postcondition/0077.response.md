To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the new user input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
   - If `a[1] > a[2]`, then either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `a[1] <= a[2]`, the program continues as expected, maintaining the same conditions and values for the variables.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('NO')` statement is unconditional and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
   - The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Given this analysis, the output of the `print('NO')` statement is straightforward:

Output: **NO**
