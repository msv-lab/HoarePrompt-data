The code snippet updates the value of `new_all` based on whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It checks each pair of consecutive elements in `new` to ensure that each element is less than or equal to the next one.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 2
- `a` is a list of integers from user input
- `i` is 2
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`

The code snippet:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```

Impact of the code:
- `new_all` is updated to `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

Since the initial state already defines `new_all` as `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the code snippet effectively re-evaluates this condition and updates `new_all` accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
