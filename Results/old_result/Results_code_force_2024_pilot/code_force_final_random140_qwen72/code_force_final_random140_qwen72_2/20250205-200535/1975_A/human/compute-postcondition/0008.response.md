To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers from user input
- `check_all` is `False` because not all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are in strictly increasing order

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the range `range(1, n)`.
- For the loop to execute, the range `range(1, n)` must contain at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `n-1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will start at 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 1**
