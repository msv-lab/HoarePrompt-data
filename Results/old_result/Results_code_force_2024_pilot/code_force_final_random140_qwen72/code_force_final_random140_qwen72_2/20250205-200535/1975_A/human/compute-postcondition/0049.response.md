Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is 1, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all` is `False` because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.**
