Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is 2.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
