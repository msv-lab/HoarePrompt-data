Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all` and `new_all` remain unchanged.** 

The code snippet `new = a[i:]` updates the variable `new` to be a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
