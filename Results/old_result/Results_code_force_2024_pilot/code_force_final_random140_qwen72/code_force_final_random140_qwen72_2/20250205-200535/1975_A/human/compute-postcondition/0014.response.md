Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers from user input.
4. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`.
5. `i` is 1.
6. The element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`.
7. `new` is a list containing elements from index 1 to the end of `a`.
8. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
9. Additionally, `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the state of the program:

- `a` is a list of integers where the first element is greater than the second element.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end of `a`.
- `check_all` is `True`, meaning all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`.
- `new_all` is `True`, meaning `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Since both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`, the conditions required for the `print('YES')` statement to execute are met.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
