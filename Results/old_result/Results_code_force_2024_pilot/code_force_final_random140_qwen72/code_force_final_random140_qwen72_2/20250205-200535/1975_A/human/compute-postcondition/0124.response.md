Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `True` if `a` is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `True`, the state remains unchanged. If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is set to `n-1`, and if any `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` during the loop, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from that index to the end, and `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The loop will break if `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True` or if either is `False`. If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations.***
