The code snippet `check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])` evaluates whether the first element of the list `a` is greater than every element in the sublist `new`. The result of this evaluation is assigned to the variable `check_all`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
- The list comprehension `[(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]` generates a list of boolean values indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than each element in `new`.
- `all([...])` checks if all elements in the generated list are `True`.

If `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, `check_all` will be `True`. Otherwise, `check_all` will be `False`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 3
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end
- `check_all` and `new_all` remain unchanged

After executing the code, the only variable that changes is `check_all`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` remains unchanged.**
