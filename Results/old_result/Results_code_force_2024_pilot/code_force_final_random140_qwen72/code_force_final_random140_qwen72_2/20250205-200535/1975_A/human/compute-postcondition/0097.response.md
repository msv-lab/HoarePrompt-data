Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` or both.**
