Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from user input.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- The element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 1 to the end of `a`.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- Either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, or both.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Explanation:
- The conditions provided do not affect the output of the print statement directly. The print statement is a simple command to print a string literal.
- The conditions about `check_all` and `new_all` being `False` or one of them being `False` suggest that the program logic might be checking for certain properties of the list `a` and its derived list `new`, but this does not change the fact that the print statement will always print `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
