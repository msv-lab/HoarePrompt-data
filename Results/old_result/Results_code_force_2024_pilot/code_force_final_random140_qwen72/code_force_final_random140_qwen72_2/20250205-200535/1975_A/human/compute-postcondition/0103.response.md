Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `True` if `a` is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code `new = a[i:]` updates the variable `new` to be a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 (since `i` is 2) to the end of the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new_all`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2, which means it includes all elements of `a` from the third element onwards.
- The conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `new_all` remain as specified in the initial state.
