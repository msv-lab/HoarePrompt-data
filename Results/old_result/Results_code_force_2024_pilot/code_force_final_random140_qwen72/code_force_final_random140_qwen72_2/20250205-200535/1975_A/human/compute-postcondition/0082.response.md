Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is `n-1`, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`. If `check_all` is `True`, then `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `False`, then the program has printed 'NO' and broken out of the loop. If `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, the program has printed 'YES' and broken out of the loop.***
