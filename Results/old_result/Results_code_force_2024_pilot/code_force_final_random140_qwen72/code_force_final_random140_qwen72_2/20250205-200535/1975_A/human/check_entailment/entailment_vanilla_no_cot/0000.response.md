Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix. Specifically, the logic inside the `else` block does not correctly handle all possible scenarios where the array can be split and swapped to form a non-decreasing sequence.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Check**: The initial check `check_all = all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` correctly determines if the array is already non-decreasing. If it is, the program prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

2. **Finding the First Discrepancy**: The loop `for i in range(1, n):` correctly identifies the first position where the array is not in non-decreasing order (`if a[i - 1] > a[i]:`).

3. **Incorrect Split and Check**: The subsequent logic to split the array and check if the resulting array is non-decreasing is flawed:
   - `new = a[i:]` creates a new array from the identified discrepancy point.
   - `check_all = all([a[0] > new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` incorrectly checks if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the new array. This is not the correct condition to ensure the array can be made non-decreasing.
   - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if the new array is non-decreasing, but this alone is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be made non-decreasing by swapping.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the split point and check if the resulting array after the swap is non-decreasing. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Find the first discrepancy
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Check if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping
                new = a[i:] + a[:i]
                if all(new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, n)):
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the splitting and checking process to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix.
