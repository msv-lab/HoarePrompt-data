To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers from a new user input.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are greater than the element immediately before them, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the initial state, the print statement `print('YES')` will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, and `new_all`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
