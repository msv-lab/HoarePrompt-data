Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`, `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, and `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
