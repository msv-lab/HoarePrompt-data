Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is strictly increasing. If so, it prints 'YES'. If not, it further checks if there exists a point in the list where, after this point, the remaining elements form a non-decreasing sequence and all elements before this point are greater than all elements after this point. If such a point exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends. **
