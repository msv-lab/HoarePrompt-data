Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2. If the element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
