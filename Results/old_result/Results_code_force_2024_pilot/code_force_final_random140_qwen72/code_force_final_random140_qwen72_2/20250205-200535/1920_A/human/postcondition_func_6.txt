The function `func_7` processes a series of inputs to determine a specific count and range. It starts by reading an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)`. Based on the value of `t`, it updates the values of `start` and `end` and collects certain values of `v` into a list `num`. After processing all inputs, it calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus this count, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0. The function modifies the values of `start`, `end`, and `num` internally but does not affect any external variables.
