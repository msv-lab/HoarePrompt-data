### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the function `func_7` step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `start` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `end` is initialized to `1000000000`.
   - `num` is initialized as an empty list to store the "not equal" constraints.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint `(t, v)`:
     - If `t == 1` (k must be greater than or equal to `v`), update `start` to `max(start, v)`.
     - If `t == 2` (k must be less than or equal to `v`), update `end` to `min(end, v)`.
     - If `t == 3` (k must not be equal to `v`), append `v` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - Initialize `count_num` to `0`.
   - Iterate over the list `num` and count how many values fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - Calculate the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` as `end - start + 1`.
   - Subtract the count of invalid values (`count_num`) from the total number of integers in the range.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, return `0` (no valid integers).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Handling "Not Equal" Constraints**:
  - The function correctly identifies and stores the "not equal" constraints in the list `num`.
  - It then iterates over `num` and counts how many of these values fall within the range `[start, end]`.
  - The count of these values is subtracted from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `start` is greater than `end`, the function correctly returns `0` (no valid integers).
  - If there are no "not equal" constraints, the function correctly returns the size of the range `[start, end]`.

### Example Verification:

Consider the example input:
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

- **Constraints**:
  - `k >= 3` (start = 3)
  - `k <= 10` (end = 10)
  - `k != 1` (irrelevant since 1 is not in the range [3, 10])
  - `k != 5` (relevant since 5 is in the range [3, 10])

- **Processing**:
  - `start` is updated to `3`.
  - `end` is updated to `10`.
  - `num` contains `[1, 5]`.
  - Only `5` falls within the range `[3, 10]`, so `count_num` is `1`.

- **Result**:
  - Total integers in the range `[3, 10]` is `10 - 3 + 1 = 8`.
  - Subtract the count of invalid values: `8 - 1 = 7`.
  - The function returns `7`, which is the correct output.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment identified a potential issue with handling "not equal" constraints. However, upon closer inspection, the function `func_7` correctly processes and counts the "not equal" constraints. The logic for counting and excluding invalid values is sound, and the function produces the correct output for the given example and other edge cases.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (The given program is correct).
