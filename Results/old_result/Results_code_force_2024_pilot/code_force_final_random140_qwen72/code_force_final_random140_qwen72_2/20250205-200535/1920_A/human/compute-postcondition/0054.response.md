Postcondition: ***`num` must contain at least three integers, `i` is the third integer in `num`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
