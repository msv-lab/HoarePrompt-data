Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. Let's break down the key components and their correctness:

1. **Input Handling (`func_1` and `func_2`)**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and returns it.
   - `func_2` reads the constraints for each test case and returns them as a list of tuples.

2. **Constraint Processing (`func_7`)**:
   - `func_7` processes each test case by reading the number of constraints \( n \) and then reading each constraint.
   - It maintains `start` and `end` to track the minimum and maximum bounds for \( k \).
   - It also maintains a list `num` to store the values of \( k \) that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) by:
     - Counting how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
     - Subtracting this count from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - The main loop calls `func_7` for each test case and appends the result to the `ans` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in `ans`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initialization**:
  - `start` is initialized to -1, which ensures that any valid lower bound will update it.
  - `end` is initialized to 1000000000, which ensures that any valid upper bound will update it.
  - `num` is initialized as an empty list to store the values to avoid.

- **Constraint Types**:
  - Type 1 (k >= x): Updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
  - Type 2 (k <= x): Updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
  - Type 3 (k != x): Adds `x` to the `num` list.

- **Range Calculation**:
  - The range of valid \( k \) is `[start, end]`.
  - The number of valid integers in this range is `end - start + 1`.
  - The number of invalid integers in this range (from `num`) is counted and subtracted from the total.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there are no valid integers, so the function returns 0.
  - The function correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all types of constraints, calculates the valid range, and accounts for the values to avoid. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
