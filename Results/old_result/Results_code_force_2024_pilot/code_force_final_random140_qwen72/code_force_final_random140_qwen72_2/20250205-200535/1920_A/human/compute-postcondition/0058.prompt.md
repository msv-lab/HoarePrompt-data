You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. start and end are initialized as -1 and 1000000000 respectively. num is an empty list.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all `n` iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `num` is a list containing all the integers `v` for which `t` was 3 during the iterations. `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than the initial `start`. `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` was 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` was less than the initial `end`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `num` contains all the integers as it did initially, `i` is the last integer in `num`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and `count_num` is the total number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` and `start` are the same as they were initially, and `count_num` is the total number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus the count of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` and `start` are the same as they were initially, and `count_num` is the total number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
