### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000` to represent the initial bounds for `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the function reads the type `t` and the value `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `1` (k must be greater than or equal to `x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `2` (k must be less than or equal to `x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
   - If the constraint type is `3` (k must not be equal to `x`), it appends `v` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - The function initializes `count_num` to `0` to count the number of invalid values within the range `[start, end]`.
   - It iterates through the list `num` and increments `count_num` for each value that lies within the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The function calculates the number of valid integers `k` as `end - start + 1 - count_num`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns `0` because no valid `k` exists.

### Validation Using Function Summary:
- The function summary confirms that `func_7` processes the constraints correctly by updating `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint.
- It also confirms that the function counts the number of invalid values within the range `[start, end]` and returns the correct result based on the calculated range and invalid values.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_7` correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints. The logic is sound and handles all the specified constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
