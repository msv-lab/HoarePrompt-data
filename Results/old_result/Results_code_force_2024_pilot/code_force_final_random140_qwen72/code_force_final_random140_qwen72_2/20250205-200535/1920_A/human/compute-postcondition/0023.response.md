Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`, and `end` remains unchanged (if `t` != 2). Otherwise, `start` and `end` remain as they were initially.***
