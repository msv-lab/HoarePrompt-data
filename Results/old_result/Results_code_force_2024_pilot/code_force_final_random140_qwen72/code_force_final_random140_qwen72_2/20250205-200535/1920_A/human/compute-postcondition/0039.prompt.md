Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 1, then if `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v` and remains less than `end`. Otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` == 2, `start` remains -1, and if `end` > `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains unchanged. If `t` == 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`. If `t` is neither 1, 2, nor 3, all variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `num` is a list. If `t` == 3, `num` contains `[v]`. If `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`. If none of these conditions are met, `start` and `end` remain as they were initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `num` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is set to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. If `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is set to `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged. If `t` == 3, `num` is the list from the previous iteration with `v` appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
