### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. It correctly handles the input and returns the integer value. This is necessary for the main loop to iterate over the test cases.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program. However, it is designed to read and process input lines, which could be useful in other contexts but is not needed here.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program. It concatenates elements of a list into a string, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program. It finds the indices of a substring in a string, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program. It finds the indices of a specific element in a list, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program. It finds a sublist in a list of lists based on a specific element, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

7. **Function `func_7`**:
   - This function is the core of the solution. It reads the number of constraints `n` and processes each constraint to update the `start` and `end` values and collect the values of `v` for type 3 constraints.
   - It correctly handles the constraints:
     - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of the current `start` and `x`.
     - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of the current `end` and `x`.
     - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), it collects `x` into the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the count of invalid `k` values (those in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`) from the total range size `end - start + 1`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0, indicating no valid `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The main function `func_7` processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. The other functions, while not used in the main logic, do not interfere with the correctness of the program.

**Correctness: **True****
