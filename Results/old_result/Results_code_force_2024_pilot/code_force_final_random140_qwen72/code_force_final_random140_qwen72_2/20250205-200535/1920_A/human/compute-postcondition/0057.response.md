The function `func_7` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it uses predefined values for `start` (-1), `end` (1000000000), and `num` (an empty list). The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `count_num` is the total number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.

Functionality: **The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus the count of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.**
