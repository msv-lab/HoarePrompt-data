Postcondition: ***`num` must contain at least one integer, and `i` is the first integer in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1.***
