The function `func_4` takes two parameters: `string` (a string) and `substring` (a non-empty string). It returns a list of integers representing the starting positions of all occurrences of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns an empty list. After the function concludes, the original `string` and `substring` remain unchanged, and the returned list contains the indices of the starting positions of `substring` in `string`.
