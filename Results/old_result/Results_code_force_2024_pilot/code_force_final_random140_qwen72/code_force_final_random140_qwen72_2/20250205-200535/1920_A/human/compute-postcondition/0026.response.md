Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, if `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`. If neither condition is met, `start` and `end` remain as they were initially.***
