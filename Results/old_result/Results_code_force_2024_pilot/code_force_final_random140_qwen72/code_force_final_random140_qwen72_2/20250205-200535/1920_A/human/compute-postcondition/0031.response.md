Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `num` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `start` is equal to `v`.** 

The variable `start` is now set to the value of `v`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
