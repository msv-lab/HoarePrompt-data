Output State: **The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` and `start` are the same as they were initially, and `count_num` is the total number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.**
