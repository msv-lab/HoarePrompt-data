The code snippet `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `t` and `v`.

- The initial state includes: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, and `num` is an empty list.
- After executing the code, `t` and `v` are assigned the values from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**
