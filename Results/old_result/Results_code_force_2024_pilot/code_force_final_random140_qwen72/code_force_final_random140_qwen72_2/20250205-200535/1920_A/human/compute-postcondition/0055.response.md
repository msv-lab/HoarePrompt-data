Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `num` contains all the integers as it did initially, `i` is the last integer in `num`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and `count_num` is the total number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The list `num` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- The variable `i` will be the last integer in the list `num` after the loop completes.
- The variables `start` and `end` retain their initial values throughout the loop.
- The variable `count_num` will hold the count of integers in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`. This means that for each integer `i` in `num`, if `i` is between `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is incremented by 1. If `i` is outside this range, `count_num` remains unchanged for that iteration.
