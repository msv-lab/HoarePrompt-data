Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `num` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is set to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. If `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is set to `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged. If `t` == 3, `num` is the list from the previous iteration with `v` appended.***
