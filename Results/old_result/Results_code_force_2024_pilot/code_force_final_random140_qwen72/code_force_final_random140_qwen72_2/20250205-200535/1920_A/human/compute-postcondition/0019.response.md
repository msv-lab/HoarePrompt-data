The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `i` is 0
- `num` is an empty list
- `t` is an input integer
- `v` is an input integer
- The conditions for `start` and `end` have been applied based on the value of `t`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

Since `i` was 0 at the end of the last iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 1, then if `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v` and remains less than `end`. Otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` == 2, `start` remains -1, and if `end` > `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains unchanged. If `t` == 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`. If `t` is neither 1, 2, nor 3, all variables retain their initial values.**
