The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `v`. This impacts the values of `t` and `v` but does not affect the other variables (`n`, `i`, `num`, `start`, and `end`). 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `i` is 1
- `num` is an empty list
- `t` is an input integer
- `v` is an input integer
- `start` is -1 (if `t` != 1)
- `end` is unchanged (if `t` != 2)

After executing the code:
- `t` is now the first integer read from the input
- `v` is now the second integer read from the input

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `start` is -1 (if `t` != 1), `end` is unchanged (if `t` != 2)**.
