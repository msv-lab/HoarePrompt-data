Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `num` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `v`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged. The new values of `t` and `v` are determined by the user input.
