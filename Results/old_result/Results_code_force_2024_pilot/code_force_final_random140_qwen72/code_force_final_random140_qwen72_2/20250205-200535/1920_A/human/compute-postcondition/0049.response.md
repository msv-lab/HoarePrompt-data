The provided code snippet increments the variable `count_num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` must contain at least two integers, and `i` is the second integer in `num`. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, the code will execute and increment `count_num`.

Since the code only affects `count_num` and increments it by 1, the output state will reflect this change while keeping the rest of the initial state unchanged.

Output State: **`num` must contain at least two integers, `i` is the second integer in `num`, `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1.**
