Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list.**

The code snippet `num = []` reassigns the variable `num` to an empty list, which does not change its initial state since `num` was already an empty list. The other variables (`n`, `start`, and `end`) remain unchanged.
