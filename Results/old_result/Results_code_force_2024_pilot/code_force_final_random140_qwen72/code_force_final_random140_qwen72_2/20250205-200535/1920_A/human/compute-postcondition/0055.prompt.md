Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all `n` iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `num` is a list containing all the integers `v` for which `t` was 3 during the iterations. `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than the initial `start`. `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` was 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` was less than the initial `end`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. `count_num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`num` must contain at least one integer, and `i` is the first integer in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`num` must contain at least two integers, and `i` is the second integer in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration without changing `count_num`. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1. The values of `num`, `i`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged, but the loop continues to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`num` must contain at least three integers, `i` is the third integer in `num`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1, and the loop continues to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
