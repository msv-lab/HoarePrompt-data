The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts (defaulting to splitting by whitespace), converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` will be a list of integers derived from the user's input.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
