Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1 after all iterations of the loop.
- `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers from user input.
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The variable `possible` is True, indicating that `current_balance` did not become less than 0 at any point during the loop.

Given that `possible` is True, it means that the conditions in the loop have been satisfied, and the program has determined that the distribution of water is feasible without any negative balance at any point.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
