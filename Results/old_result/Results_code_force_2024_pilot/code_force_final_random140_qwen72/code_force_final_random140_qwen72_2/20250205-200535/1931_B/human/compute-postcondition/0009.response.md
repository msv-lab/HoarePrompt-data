Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, then the elements of `arr` are in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, there exists at least one index `i` in the range [0, n-2] such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.***
