The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is True, `i` is 0**
