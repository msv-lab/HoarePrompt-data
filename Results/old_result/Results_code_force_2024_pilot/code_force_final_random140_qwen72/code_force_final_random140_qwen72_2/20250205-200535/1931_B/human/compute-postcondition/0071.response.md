Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is now `a[0] - target`, `possible` is False, `i` is 0, and the current value of `current_balance` is less than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
