Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the specified pouring operation. The key insight is that if the total amount of water is evenly divisible by the number of containers, and if we can transfer water from any container to any other container to the right of it, then it should be possible to equalize the water levels if and only if the initial distribution allows for such transfers without violating the condition \(i < j\).

However, the provided solution in `func_1` is incorrect because it simply sorts the array and checks if it is in non-decreasing order. This approach does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Sorting and Non-Decreasing Order**: Sorting the array and checking if it is in non-decreasing order does not reflect the actual possibility of equalizing the water levels using the allowed operations. The sorting step changes the original positions of the elements, which is not relevant to the problem's constraints (i.e., pouring from a container to another container to its right).

2. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach involves calculating the average amount of water per container (since the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers). Then, for each container, check if it is possible to transfer water to or from other containers to reach this average. This can be done by ensuring that the sum of deviations from the average (positive and negative) can be balanced through the allowed operations.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
