You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of containers. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is `t - 1`, and for each test case, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. It sorts the list and checks if the elements are in non-decreasing order. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the printed results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic used to determine if it is possible to equalize the water levels in the containers. The program sorts the array and checks if it is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array changes the original order of the containers, which is not allowed according to the problem statement. The problem requires us to pour water from one container to another without changing the order of the containers.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**: Checking if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order does not guarantee that the water levels can be equalized. The correct approach would be to check if the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers and if the maximum difference between any two containers can be reduced to zero by pouring water from higher to lower containers.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3
```
According to the problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. The sum of the water in the containers is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\), which is divisible by 3. The average amount of water per container is \(6 / 3 = 2\).

To equalize the water:
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the first container. Now the containers have [2, 2, 2].

The correct answer should be "YES" because it is possible to equalize the water levels. However, the provided program will output "NO" because it checks if the array is sorted, which it is not after sorting.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
