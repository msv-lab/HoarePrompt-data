The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2 * target`, `i` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.**
