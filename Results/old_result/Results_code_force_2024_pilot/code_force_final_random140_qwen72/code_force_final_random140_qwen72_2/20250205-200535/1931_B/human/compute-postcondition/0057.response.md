Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, split by spaces, and converted to integers.
- `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`.
- `target` is calculated as `total_water // n`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `target`.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `possible` is set to `False`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is a static string.

Output: **NO**
