The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`.

- The value of `_` remains incremented by 1.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than the current value of `_` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` is still an input integer and is not affected by this code snippet.
- The new variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the user's input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
