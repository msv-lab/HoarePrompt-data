The function `func_1` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple inputs, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of containers `n` for each test case, and the amounts of water in the containers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of containers.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the amounts of water in the containers.
- The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- The total sum of `a_i` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^9.

The function's output is not explicitly provided, but typically, such a function would process the input data and return some result based on the given constraints. Since the exact output is not specified, I will assume the function processes the input and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in the containers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It processes the input data and returns a result for each test case.**
