Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the specified pouring operation. The key points to consider are:

1. **Sum Divisibility**: The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. This means there exists an average amount of water per container that can be achieved if the distribution is possible.
2. **Pouring Operation**: Water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. This constraint limits the direction of water flow but does not necessarily prevent achieving the goal.
3. **Feasibility of Equalization**: To achieve equal amounts of water in all containers, the total amount of water must be evenly distributed. If the initial distribution of water allows for this, the operation can be used to redistribute the water accordingly.

However, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Sorting and Checking Monotonicity**: The program sorts the array and checks if it is monotonically increasing. This approach is incorrect because:
  - Sorting the array changes the original order of the containers, which is crucial for the pouring operation.
  - Checking if the sorted array is monotonically increasing does not ensure that the water can be redistributed to achieve equal amounts in all containers.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the minimum amount of water in any container is at least the average amount of water. If it is, then it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount of water. If not, it is impossible.

Here is the correct approach:

1. Calculate the average amount of water per container.
2. Check if the minimum amount of water in any container is at least the average amount. If it is, output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
