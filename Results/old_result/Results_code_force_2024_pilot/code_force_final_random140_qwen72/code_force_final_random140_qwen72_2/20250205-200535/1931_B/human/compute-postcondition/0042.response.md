Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `i` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is True. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
