Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`. If at any point during the loop `current_balance` becomes less than 0, `possible` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.
- The input integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `a` of integers from user input remains unchanged.
- The variable `total_water` remains the sum of the elements in `a`.
- The variable `target` remains the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- The variable `current_balance` is updated to the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The loop index `i` will be `n-1` after the final iteration.
- If at any point during the loop `current_balance` becomes less than 0, the variable `possible` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.
