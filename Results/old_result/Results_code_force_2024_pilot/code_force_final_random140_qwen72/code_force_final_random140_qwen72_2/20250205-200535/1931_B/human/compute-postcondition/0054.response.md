Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `target`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is True.** 

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the condition that `possible` is True, indicating that `current_balance` has not become less than 0 at any point during the loop.
