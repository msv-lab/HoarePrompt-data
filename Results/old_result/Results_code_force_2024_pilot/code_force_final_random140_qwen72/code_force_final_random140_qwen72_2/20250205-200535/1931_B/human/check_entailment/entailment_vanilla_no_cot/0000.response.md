Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` sorts the array and checks if it is non-decreasing. However, this approach does not address the core requirement of the problem, which is to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers by pouring water from one container to another under the given constraints.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the minimum value in the array is less than or equal to the average value of the array (since the sum of all elements is divisible by `n`, the average is an integer). If the minimum value is less than the average, it means there is at least one container that needs more water to reach the average, and since we can only pour water from a container with a higher index to a lower index, it might not be possible to achieve the goal. However, if the minimum value is equal to the average, it is always possible to equalize the water levels because we can always pour water from containers with more than the average to those with less.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the average water level
        avg = sum(arr) // n
        
        # Check if the minimum value is less than the average
        if min(arr) < avg:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This version correctly determines if it is possible to equalize the water levels in all containers.
