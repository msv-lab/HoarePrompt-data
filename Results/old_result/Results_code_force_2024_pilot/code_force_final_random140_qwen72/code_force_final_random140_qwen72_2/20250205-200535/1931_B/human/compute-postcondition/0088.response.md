Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` did not become less than 0 at any point during the loop, `possible` remains True. Otherwise, `possible` is set to False.***
