The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `i` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is True. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
