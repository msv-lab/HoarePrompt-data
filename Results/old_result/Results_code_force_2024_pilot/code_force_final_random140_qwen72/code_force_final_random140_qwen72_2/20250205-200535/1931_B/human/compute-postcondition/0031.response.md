Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` remains True unless `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop.**
