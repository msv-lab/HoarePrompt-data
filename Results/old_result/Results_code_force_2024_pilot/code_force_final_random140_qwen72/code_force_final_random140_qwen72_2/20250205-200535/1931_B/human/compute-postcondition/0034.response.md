Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` remains True unless `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `target = total_water // n` updates the value of `target` to be the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `current_balance`, `i`, `_`, and `possible`) remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `target` is now `total_water // n`.
- The rest of the initial state remains the same.
