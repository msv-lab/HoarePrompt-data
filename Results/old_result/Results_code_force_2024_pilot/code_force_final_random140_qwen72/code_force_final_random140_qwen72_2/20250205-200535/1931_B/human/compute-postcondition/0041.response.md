Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `i` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `possible` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is within. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the control flow is altered to exit the loop or conditional block.
