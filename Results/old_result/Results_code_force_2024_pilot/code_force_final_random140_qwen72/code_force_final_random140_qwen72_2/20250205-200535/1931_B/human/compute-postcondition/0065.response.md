Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `current_balance` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
