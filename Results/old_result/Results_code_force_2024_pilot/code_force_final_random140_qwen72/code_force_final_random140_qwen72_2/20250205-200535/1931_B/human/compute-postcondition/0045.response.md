Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2 * target`, `i` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is False.** 

The variable `possible` is set to False, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
