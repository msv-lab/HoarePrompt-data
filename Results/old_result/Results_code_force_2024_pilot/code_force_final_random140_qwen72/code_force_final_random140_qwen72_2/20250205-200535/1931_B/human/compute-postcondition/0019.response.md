The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `arr`. This operation updates the value of `arr` based on the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 2. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.**
