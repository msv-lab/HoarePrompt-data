Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `_` is 1.
- `t` must be greater than 1.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will always print the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state. The conditions and values of the variables do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
