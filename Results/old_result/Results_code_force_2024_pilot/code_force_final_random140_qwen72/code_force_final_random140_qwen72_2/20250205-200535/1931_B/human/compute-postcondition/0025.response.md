The function `func_1` is described with specific constraints but lacks explicit parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given context, the function likely accepts parameters related to the number of test cases (`t`), the number of containers (`n`), and a list of integers (`a`) representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The function's primary goal is to process these inputs according to the specified constraints and return a result.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the number of containers `n` for each test case, and a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, ensuring that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.**
