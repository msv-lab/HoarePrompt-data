Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` remains True unless `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop.**

Explanation:
- The variable `current_balance` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `i`, `_`, and `possible`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
