Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `target`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is True unless `current_balance` became less than 0 at any point during the loop, in which case `possible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, once for each element in the list `a`.
- In each iteration, `current_balance` is updated by adding the difference between the current element `a[i]` and `target`.
- If at any point `current_balance` becomes less than 0, `possible` is set to False and the loop breaks.
- After all iterations (or when the loop breaks), `i` will be `n-1` (if the loop completes) or the index where `current_balance` first became negative (if the loop breaks).
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1 with each iteration, but it does not affect the final state.
- The final value of `current_balance` will be the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `target` up to the point where the loop either completes or breaks.
- The value of `possible` will be False if `current_balance` ever became less than 0; otherwise, it will remain True.
