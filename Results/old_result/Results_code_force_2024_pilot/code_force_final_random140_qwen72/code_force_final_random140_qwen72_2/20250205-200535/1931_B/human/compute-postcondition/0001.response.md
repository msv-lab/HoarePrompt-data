The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter since it's not actually used within the loop. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop runs. However, they are part of the state before the loop starts and should be mentioned to provide a complete picture.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute), `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5**.
