The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `b`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `range(1, len(b))`. For the loop to execute, `b` must have at least 2 elements (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b) - 1`). The variable `i` is not directly used in the loop head but is initialized outside the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` must be a list with at least 2 elements**
