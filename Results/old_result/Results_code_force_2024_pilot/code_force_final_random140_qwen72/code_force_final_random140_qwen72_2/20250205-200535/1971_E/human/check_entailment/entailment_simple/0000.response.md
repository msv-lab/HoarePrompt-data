Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the lists `a` and `b` with an additional zero at the beginning to handle the starting point (0, 0) more easily. It also initializes `ad` and `bd` to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.

3. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed `v` for each segment between the known points using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`. This is correct because the speed is the distance traveled divided by the time taken.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the appropriate segment in `a` where `ql` belongs. If `ql` is exactly one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time from `b`. Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by adding the time taken to reach the previous known point and the time taken to travel the remaining distance in the current segment.

5. **Time Calculation**: The time calculation `m += b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` is correct. It adds the time taken to reach the previous known point `b[s - 1]` and the time taken to travel the remaining distance `ql - a[s - 1]` in the current segment, which is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the calculated time for each query, ensuring that the result is rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
