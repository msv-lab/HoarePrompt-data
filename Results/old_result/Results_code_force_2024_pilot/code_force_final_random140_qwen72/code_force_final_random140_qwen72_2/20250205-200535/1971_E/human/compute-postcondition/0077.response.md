Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have a length greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` retains its initial value, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` and `ql` will be updated in each iteration based on the values of `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.**
