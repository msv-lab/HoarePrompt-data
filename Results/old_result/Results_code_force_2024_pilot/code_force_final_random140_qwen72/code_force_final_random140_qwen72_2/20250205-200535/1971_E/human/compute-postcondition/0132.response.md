To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `m` is updated to `m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the new `ql`.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `l` is incremented by 1, and it must be less than `q`.
- If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Update `m`**:
   - `m` is updated to `m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.
   - This means `m` is increased by the product of `bd[s]` and the integer division of `ql` by `ad[s]`.

2. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - This means `ql` is reduced by the value of the element at index `s - 1` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the new `ql`.
   - This means `s` is the smallest index such that `a[s] >= ql`.

4. **Increment `l`**:
   - `l` is incremented by 1.
   - `l` must be less than `q`.

5. **Check for Skip Condition**:
   - If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
   - This means if `a[s] == ql`, the `print` statement will not execute for this iteration.

### Output Determination:
Given the above steps, the `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` after the updates described. Since the exact values of `m`, `bd`, `ql`, `ad`, `a`, and `q` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **m (where m is the value of m after being updated to m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s]), and s is the index of the first element in a that is greater than or equal to the new ql, and the new ql is ql - a[s - 1])**
