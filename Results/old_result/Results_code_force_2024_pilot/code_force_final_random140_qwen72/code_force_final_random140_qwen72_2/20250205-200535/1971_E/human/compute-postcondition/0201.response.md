Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `l` is equal to `q - 1`, `m` has been updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` for each iteration where `a[s] != ql`, and `ql` has been updated to `input integer - a[s - 1]` for each iteration. The values of `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged as they were initialized or modified before the loop started. The variable `s` holds the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the most recent `ql` for each iteration.**
