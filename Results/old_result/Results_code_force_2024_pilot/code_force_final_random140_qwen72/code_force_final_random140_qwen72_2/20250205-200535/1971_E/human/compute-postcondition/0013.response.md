Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the list `a`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- **`ad`**: The list `ad` will contain the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`. For example, if `a = [0, 5, 10, 15]`, then `ad` will be `[5, 5, 5]` after the loop completes. Each element in `ad` represents the difference between the current element and the previous element in `a`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, `bd`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
