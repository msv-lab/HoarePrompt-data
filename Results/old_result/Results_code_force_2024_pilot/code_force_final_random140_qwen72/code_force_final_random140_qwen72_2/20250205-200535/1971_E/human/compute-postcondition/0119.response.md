Output State: **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`, `i` is 1, and `l` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` to its current value, which was `b[s - 1]`.
- The value of `ql` remains `ql - a[s - 1]` as specified in the initial state.
- The value of `s` remains the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `l` remains unchanged.
