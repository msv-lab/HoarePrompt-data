Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `i`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` retain their initial values, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` will be updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` for each iteration, `ql` will be updated to `ql - a[s - 1]` for each iteration, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.**
