Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is `len(b)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` must be a list with at least 3 elements, `bd` is updated to include the difference `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]` at its end.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the difference between the last two elements of `b` to the list `bd`.
- The value of `i` is `len(b)`, which means `i` is the length of `b`.
- The new element added to `bd` is `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`, which is the difference between the last and second-to-last elements of `b`.
- All other variables (`a`, `i`, `ad`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `b` must be a list with at least 3 elements is still valid.
