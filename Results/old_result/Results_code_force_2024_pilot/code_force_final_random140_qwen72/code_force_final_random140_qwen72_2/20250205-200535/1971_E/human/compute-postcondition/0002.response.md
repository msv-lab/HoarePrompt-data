The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, but this state is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are input integers.**
