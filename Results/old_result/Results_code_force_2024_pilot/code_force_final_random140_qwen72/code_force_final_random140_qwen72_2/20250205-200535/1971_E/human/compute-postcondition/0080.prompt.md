Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `i` retains its initial value, `ad` is `[0]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` retains its initial value, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` and `ql` will be updated in each iteration based on the values of `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have a length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` retains its initial value, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` and `ql` will be updated in each iteration based on the values of `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have a length greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` retains its initial value, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` and `ql` will be updated in each iteration based on the values of `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have a length greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` retains its initial value, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` and `ql` will be updated in each iteration based on the values of `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
