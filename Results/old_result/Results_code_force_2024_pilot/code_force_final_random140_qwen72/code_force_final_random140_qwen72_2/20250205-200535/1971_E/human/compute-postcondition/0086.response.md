Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have a length greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 3, `ad` is a list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `a` (starting with 0), `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2]]`, `v` retains its initial value, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` and `ql` will be updated in each iteration based on the values of `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of the list `b` to the list `bd`.
- Since `i` is 3, `b[i]` is `b[3]` and `b[i - 1]` is `b[2]`.
- Therefore, the new element added to `bd` is `b[3] - b[2]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
