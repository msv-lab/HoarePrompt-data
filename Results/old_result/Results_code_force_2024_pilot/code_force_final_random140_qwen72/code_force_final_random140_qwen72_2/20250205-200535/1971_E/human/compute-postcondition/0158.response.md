Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element, `v` is a list containing the integer 0 and the value `ad[i] / bd[i]`.** 

Explanation:
- The code appends the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`.
- `v` initially contains only the integer 0.
- After executing the code, `v` now contains 0 and the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `i`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`) remain unchanged.
