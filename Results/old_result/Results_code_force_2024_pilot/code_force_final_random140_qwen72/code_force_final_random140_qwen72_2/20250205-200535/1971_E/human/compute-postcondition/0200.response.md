To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered by the user.
- `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
- `ad` is a list that includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.
- `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element.
- `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`.
- `l` is 2.
- `q` must be greater than 2.
- `m` is now `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`.
- `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the new `ql`. If `a[s] == ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by user-entered integers.
   - `b` is a list with at least as many elements as `a`.

2. **Calculation of `ad` and `bd`:**
   - `ad` contains the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.
   - `bd` contains the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element.

3. **Calculation of `v`:**
   - `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` by the corresponding element in `bd`.

4. **Initialization of `m` and `ql`:**
   - `m` is updated using the formula `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`.
   - `ql` is updated using the formula `ql - a[s - 1]`.

5. **Finding `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the new `ql`.
   - If `a[s] == ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the initial state and the transformations, the exact value of `m` depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and other variables. However, based on the provided information, the print statement will output the value of `m` after the specified transformations.

Output: **m (where m is the value of m after the specified transformations)**
