Output State: **`m` is 0, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`, `i` is 1, `l` is `l + 1` and `l` must be less than `q`**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is set to 0.
- The value of `ql` remains `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- The value of `s` remains the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `l` remains `l + 1`, and it must still be less than `q`.
