Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` must be a list with at least 3 elements, `bd` is updated to include the difference `b[i] - b[i - 1]` at its end.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- The value of `ad` remains unchanged.
- The value of `b` remains unchanged.
- The list `bd` is updated to include the difference `b[i] - b[i - 1]` at its end. This means that the last element of `bd` is now the difference between the last two elements of `b`.
