To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`.
- `b` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`.
- `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad[1:]` by the corresponding element in `bd`.
- `l` is 2.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `m` is now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
- `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order.
   - Since `a` starts with 0 and is followed by input integers, `s` will be the index such that `a[s-1] <= ql < a[s]`.

2. **Calculate `ql`:**
   - `ql` is initially greater than 1.
   - After the update, `ql` becomes `ql - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
   - Here, `b[s - 1]` is the element in `b` at index `s - 1`.
   - `bd[s]` is the difference between `b[s]` and `b[s - 1]`.
   - `ad[s]` is the difference between `a[s]` and `a[s - 1]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some specific values for clarity:
- `a = [0, 2, 5, 8]`
- `b = [1, 3, 7, 12]`
- `ad = [2, 3, 3]`
- `bd = [2, 4, 5]`
- `v = [0, 1, 0.75]`
- `l = 2`
- `q = 3`
- `ql = 3`

1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `a = [0, 2, 5, 8]`
   - `ql = 3`
   - `s` is the index where `3` fits in `a` to maintain the order, which is `2` (since `a[1] = 2` and `a[2] = 5`).

2. **Calculate `ql`:**
   - `ql = 3 - a[s - 1] = 3 - 2 = 1`

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `b[s - 1] = b[1] = 3`
   - `bd[s] = bd[2] = 5`
   - `ad[s] = ad[2] = 3`
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`
   - `m = 3 + 5 * (1 - 2) // 3`
   - `m = 3 + 5 * (-1) // 3`
   - `m = 3 + (-5) // 3`
   - `m = 3 - 2`
   - `m = 1`

### Final Output:
The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
