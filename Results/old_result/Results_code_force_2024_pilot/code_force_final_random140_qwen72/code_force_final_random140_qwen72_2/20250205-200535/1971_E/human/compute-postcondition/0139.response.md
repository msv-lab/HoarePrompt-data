Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `l` is equal to `q`, `m` is updated based on the calculations involving `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, `ql` is adjusted to `ql - a[s - 1]` if `a[s]` does not equal `ql`, `s` is the position where the current `ql` fits in the list `a` to maintain the order, `i` is 1, `ad` is now `[0]`, `bd` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed for the loop to execute one more time, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `b` is updated to `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`.**
