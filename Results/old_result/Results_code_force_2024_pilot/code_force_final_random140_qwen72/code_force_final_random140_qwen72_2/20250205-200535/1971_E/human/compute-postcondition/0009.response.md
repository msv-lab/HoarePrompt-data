The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `a`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and the length of `a` must be greater than 2.

State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the difference between the first input integer and 0.**
