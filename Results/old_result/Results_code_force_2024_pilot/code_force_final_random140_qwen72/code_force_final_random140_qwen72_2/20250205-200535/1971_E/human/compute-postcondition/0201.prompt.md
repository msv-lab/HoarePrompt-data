Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element, `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element, `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`, `l` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s-1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element, `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`, `l` is 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element, `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`, `l` is 2, `q` must be greater than 2, `m` is now `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`, `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the new `ql`. If `a[s] == ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
