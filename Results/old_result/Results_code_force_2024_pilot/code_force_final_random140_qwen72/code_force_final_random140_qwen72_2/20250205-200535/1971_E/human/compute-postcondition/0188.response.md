To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant calculations step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered by the user.
- `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
- `ad` is a list that includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.
- `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element.
- `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`.
- `l` is 1.
- `q` must be greater than 1.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.
- `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.
   - For example, if `a = [0, 2, 5, 8]` and `ql = 6`, then `s` would be 3 because `a[3] = 8` is the first element not less than 6.

2. **Calculate `ql`:**
   - `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - Using the previous example, if the input integer is 10, then `ql = 10 - a[2] = 10 - 5 = 5`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.
   - Continuing with the example:
     - `b[s - 1]` is the element in `b` at index `s - 1`.
     - `bd[s]` is the difference between consecutive elements of `b` at index `s`.
     - `ad[s]` is the difference between consecutive elements of `a` at index `s`.
     - `ql // ad[s]` is the integer division of `ql` by `ad[s]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `a = [0, 2, 5, 8]`
- `b = [1, 3, 7, 11]`
- Input integer is 10

1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is 3 because `a[3] = 8` is the first element not less than 6.

2. **Calculate `ql`:**
   - `ql = 10 - a[2] = 10 - 5 = 5`

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `b[s - 1] = b[2] = 7`
   - `bd[s] = b[3] - b[2] = 11 - 7 = 4`
   - `ad[s] = a[3] - a[2] = 8 - 5 = 3`
   - `ql // ad[s] = 5 // 3 = 1`
   - `m = b[2] + bd[3] * (5 // 3) = 7 + 4 * 1 = 11`

### Final Output:
The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **11 **
