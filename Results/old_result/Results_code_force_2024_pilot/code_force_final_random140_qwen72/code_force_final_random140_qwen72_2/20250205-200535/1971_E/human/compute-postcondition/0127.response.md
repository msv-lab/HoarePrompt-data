Output State: **`m` is 0, `ql` is the new input integer, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the new `ql`, `i` is 1, `l` is `l + 1` and `l` must be less than `q`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**
