Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged as it was initially defined, starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`. This is because the loop iterates from `1` to `len(a) - 1` (inclusive).
- **`ad`**: The list `ad` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of `a`. Specifically, `ad` will have `len(a) - 1` elements, where each element is the difference between the corresponding element in `a` and the previous element in `a`.

All other variables (`l`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, `bd`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
