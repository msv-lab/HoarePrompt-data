Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` will have been updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` for each query `ql` where `a[s] != ql`, and `ql` will have been adjusted to `ql - a[s - 1]` for each query. The index `s` will hold the position where the current `ql` fits in the list `a` to maintain the order. The variables `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` will remain unchanged from their initial states.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop variable `l` will have reached the value `q - 1`, indicating that all `q` queries have been processed.
- For each query `ql`, the variable `m` will have been updated to the calculated value `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` if `a[s]` is not equal to `ql`.
- The variable `ql` will have been adjusted to `ql - a[s - 1]` for each query where `a[s]` is not equal to `ql`.
- The index `s` will hold the position in the list `a` where the current `ql` would fit to maintain the sorted order.
- The lists `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` will remain unchanged from their initial states, as they are not modified within the loop.
