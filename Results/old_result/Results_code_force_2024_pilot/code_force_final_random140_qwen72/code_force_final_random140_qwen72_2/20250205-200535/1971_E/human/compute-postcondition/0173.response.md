Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element, `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`, `l` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s-1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`. If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. No variable values are changed by the `continue` statement.**
