Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. n, k, q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5. a is a list of k integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, a_i < a_{i+1}, a_k = n). b is a list of k integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1}). Each of the q queries is an integer d (0 ≤ d ≤ n). The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
