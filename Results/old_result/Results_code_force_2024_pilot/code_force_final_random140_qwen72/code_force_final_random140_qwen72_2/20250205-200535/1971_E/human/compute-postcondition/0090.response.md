Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least `len(b)` elements, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `ad` is a list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `a` (starting with 0), `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `v` is now `[0, ad[i] / bd[i]]`, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` and `ql` will be updated in each iteration based on the values of `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.
- All other variables and their properties remain unchanged from the initial state.
