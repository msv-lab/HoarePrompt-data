Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the difference between the first input integer and 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers.
- The code snippet `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` to the list `ad`.
- Since `i` starts at 1, `a[i]` refers to the first input integer, and `a[i - 1]` refers to the initial 0.
- Therefore, `ad` now contains the difference between the first input integer and 0.
- The value of `i` remains 1, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
