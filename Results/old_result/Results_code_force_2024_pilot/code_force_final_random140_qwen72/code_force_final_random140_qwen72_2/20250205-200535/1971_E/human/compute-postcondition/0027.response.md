Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(b) + 2`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, `v` is a list containing 0, the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, the new value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, and the latest value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Since `v` already contains 0, the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, and the new value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, appending another value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` results in `v` having one more element, which is the latest value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
