To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`.
- `b` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`.
- `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad[1:]` by the corresponding element in `bd`.
- `l` is 2.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `m` is 0.
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` and `ad`**:
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by input integers. For example, if the input integers are `[1, 3, 5]`, then `a` would be `[0, 1, 3, 5]`.
   - `ad` is the list of differences between consecutive elements in `a`. For the example above, `ad` would be `[1, 2, 2]`.

2. **List `b` and `bd`**:
   - `b` is a list with at least 2 elements. The exact values are not specified, but it must have at least 2 elements.
   - `bd` is the list of differences between consecutive elements in `b`. For example, if `b` is `[2, 4, 6]`, then `bd` would be `[2, 2]`.

3. **List `v`**:
   - `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad[1:]` by the corresponding element in `bd`. Using the previous examples, `v` would be `[0, 1/2, 2/2]` which simplifies to `[0, 0.5, 1]`.

4. **Variable `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order. For example, if `a` is `[0, 1, 3, 5]` and `ql` is 2, then `s` would be 2 because 2 fits between 1 and 3 in the list.

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(b[s], end=' ')` will print the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the steps above, the output will depend on the specific values of `b` and `s`. Since `s` is determined by the position of `ql` in `a`, and `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, the exact value of `b[s]` will depend on the specific values of `b` and `s`.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index where ql would fit in the list a to maintain the order, and b is a list with at least 2 elements)**
