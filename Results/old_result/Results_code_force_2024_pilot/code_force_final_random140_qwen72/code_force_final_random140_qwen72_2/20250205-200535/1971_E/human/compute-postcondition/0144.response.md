To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the loop's continuation.

### Given:
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `ad` is a list that now includes the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` (which is 0).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < len(a)` must still hold true.

### Adjustments:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The length of `a` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue (since `i` is now 2 and must be less than `len(a)`).

### Conclusion:
- `i` is now 2.
- `a` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ad` is a list that now includes the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` (which is 0).**
