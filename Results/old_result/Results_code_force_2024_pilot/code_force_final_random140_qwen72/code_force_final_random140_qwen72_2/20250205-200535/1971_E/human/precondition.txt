t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, representing the final destination, the number of known time points, and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n, representing the positions of the signs. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, representing the times when the car reaches the corresponding positions in a. Each query d is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ n, representing the distance for which the time needs to be calculated. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
