Output State: **If `a[s]` equals `ql`, then `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]` if `a[s]` equals `ql`.
- `m` is first increased by `b[s - 1]`.
- Then, `m` is further increased by the result of `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
