Output State: **`m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, if `a[s]` equals `ql`, then `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `l` must be less than `q` for the loop to execute again, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ql` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `ql` now holds an integer value provided by the user.
- The values of `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The conditions and operations involving `a[s]`, `ql`, `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ad[s]`, and `l` are still valid and will be evaluated as described in the initial state.
- The loop condition (`l` must be less than `q` for the loop to execute again) remains unchanged.
