Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list that now includes the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` (which is 0).** 

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) and the previous element `a[i-1]` (which is the first element of the list, 0) to the list `ad`. Since `a` starts with 0 and `i` is 1, the difference is simply the value of the second element of `a`. This value is appended to `ad`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
