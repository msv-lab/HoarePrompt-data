Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least `len(b)` elements, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least `len(b) + 1` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `a` (starting with 0), `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` and `ql` will be updated in each iteration based on the values of `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: If `a[s]` equals `ql`, then `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`, `i` is 1, and `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is updated to `m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the new `ql`, `i` is 1, `l` is `l + 1` and `l` must be less than `q`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
