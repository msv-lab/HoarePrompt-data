The code snippet appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given the initial state, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, and `i` is 1. The first element of `a` is 0, and the second element is the first integer entered by the user.

- `a[0]` is 0.
- `a[1]` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `i` is 1.

The difference `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is calculated as `a[1] - a[0]`, which simplifies to `a[1] - 0` or simply `a[1]`.

This value is appended to the list `ad`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the first integer entered by the user.**
