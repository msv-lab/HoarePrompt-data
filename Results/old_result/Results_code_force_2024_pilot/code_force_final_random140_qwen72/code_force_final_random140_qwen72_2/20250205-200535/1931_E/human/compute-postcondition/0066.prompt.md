Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `x` is `list_len - 1`, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string, `rev_res` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `max_power` is a string, `x` is 0, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the first element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is not divisible by 2, `rev_res` is the first element of `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 1, `max_power` is a string, `x` is 1, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list` and the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first and second elements of `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 2, `max_power` is a string, `x` is 2, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list`, the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed, and the third element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list`, the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed, and the third element of `operational_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
