The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the object `list_len`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `x` being less than `list_len`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is `x_prev + 1`.
- `list_len` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes `x_prev + 2`), and `list_len` must still be greater than the new value of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `x_prev + 2`, `list_len` must be greater than `x_prev + 2`**.
