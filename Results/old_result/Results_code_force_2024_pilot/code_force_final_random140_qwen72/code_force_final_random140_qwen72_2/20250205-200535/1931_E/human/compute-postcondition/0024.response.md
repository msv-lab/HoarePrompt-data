To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `y` is 0.
- `list_len` is a positive integer.
- `max_power` is the second part of the input.
- `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string.
- `rev_res` is the concatenated result of processing each string in `operational_list` according to the loop's rules: for even indices, trailing zeros are stripped before appending, and for odd indices, the string is appended as-is.
- If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for y in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `y` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than `int(input())`.

### Adjusting the States:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `y`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
- The value of `int(input())` remains unchanged and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, and `rev_res` is the concatenated result of processing each string in `operational_list` according to the loop's rules: for even indices, trailing zeros are stripped before appending, and for odd indices, the string is appended as-is. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.**
