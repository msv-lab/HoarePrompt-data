Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string that, when converted to an integer, represents the number of iterations the loop has completed, `max_power` is a string, `x` is `int(list_len) - 1`, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string. `rev_res` is the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` where elements at even indices (0-based) have trailing zeros removed, and elements at odd indices are concatenated as they are. Additionally, the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to the integer value of `max_power` plus one.**
