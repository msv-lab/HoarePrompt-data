Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and a parameter `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then constructs a string `rev_res` by concatenating the elements of the list, removing trailing zeros from elements at even indices and leaving elements at odd indices unchanged. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. **
