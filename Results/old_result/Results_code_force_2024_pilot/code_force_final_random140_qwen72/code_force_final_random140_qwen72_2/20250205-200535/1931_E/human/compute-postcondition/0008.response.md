Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_res` is now the first string in `operational_list`, `list_len` is the first part of the input and is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, and `x` is an odd integer starting at 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_res += operational_list[x]` appends the string at index `x` in `operational_list` to `rev_res`.
- Since `x` is initially 0 (an odd integer starting at 0), the first string in `operational_list` is appended to `rev_res`.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
