Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, representing the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the list of integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
