Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the alternating turns between Anna and Sasha correctly. Instead, it simply concatenates the numbers in a specific order without simulating the actual game mechanics.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Anna
```

In this case, Anna can reverse the number 2 to get 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha should win. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Anna" because it does not simulate the game correctly.
