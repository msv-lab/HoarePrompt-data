Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is `list_len - 1`. `rev_res` is the concatenation of the elements from `operational_list` where the elements at even indices have had their trailing zeros removed, and the elements at odd indices are concatenated as they are. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, the condition is true. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.***
