Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 2, `max_power` is a string, `x` is 2, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string. `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list`, the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed, and the third element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed.** 

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list` and the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed, since `x` is even (2).
- The code `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` appends the third element of `operational_list` (since `x` is 2) with trailing zeros removed to `rev_res`.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `x`, and `operational_list`) remain unchanged.
