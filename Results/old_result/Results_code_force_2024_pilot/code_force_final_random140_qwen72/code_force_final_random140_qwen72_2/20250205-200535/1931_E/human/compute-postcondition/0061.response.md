Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 1, `max_power` is a string, `x` is 1, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list` and the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first and second elements of `operational_list`.***
