The code snippet `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` appends to `rev_res` the string obtained by removing trailing zeros from the string at index `x` in `operational_list`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `y` is 0
- `list_len` is a positive integer
- `max_power` is the second part of the input
- `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string
- `x` is `x_prev + 1`
- If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string obtained by stripping trailing zeros from `operational_list[x]`
- If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list`

After executing the code snippet:

- `rev_res` is updated by appending the string obtained by removing trailing zeros from `operational_list[x]` to its current value.
- The values of `t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `x_prev + 1`, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string obtained by removing trailing zeros from `operational_list[x]` to its current value.**
