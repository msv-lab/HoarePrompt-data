Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list`, and the third string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed, and the third string in `operational_list`.***
