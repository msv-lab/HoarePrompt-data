Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`s1`) with the cost of buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the rest at the regular price (`s2`). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case. This approach ensures that the solution is optimal for all valid inputs.
