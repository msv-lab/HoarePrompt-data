To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\).
- `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\).

### Calculations:
1. `s1` is calculated as `n * a`.
2. `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

### Explanation:
- `s1` is simply the product of `n` and `a`.
- `s2` is a bit more complex:
  - `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2.
  - `b * (n // 2)` multiplies this result by `b`.
  - `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 (which is either 0 or 1).
  - `n % 2 * a` multiplies this remainder by `a`.
  - Finally, `s2` is the sum of these two results.

### Determining the Minimum:
- The `min(s1, s2)` function will return the smaller of the two values `s1` and `s2`.

### Output:
- The output will be the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`.

Given the formulas and the ranges of the variables, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the output will be the minimum of the two calculated values.

Output: **min(s1, s2) (where s1 = n * a and s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a)**
