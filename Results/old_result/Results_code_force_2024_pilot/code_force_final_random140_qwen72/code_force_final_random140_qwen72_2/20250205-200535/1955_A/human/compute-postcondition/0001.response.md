The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the input is constrained to be a positive integer within the range of `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will also be within this range.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), `b` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\)**.
