To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `_`.
   - The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `t` is a positive integer and represents the number of test cases, it should be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - The input value should be a positive integer within the range of `t`.

### Adjusted State:
- The input value must be a positive integer within the range of `t` (i.e., \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)).
- The loop variable `_` is not explicitly initialized but is used as a placeholder for the loop counter.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input value must be a positive integer within the range of `t` (i.e., \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\))**.
