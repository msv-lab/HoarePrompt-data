Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given two pricing options: buying each yogurt individually at `a` burles or buying two yogurts together at `b` burles. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `s1` calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought individually at `a` burles each.
   - `s2` calculates the total cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price `b`, and any remaining yogurt (if `n` is odd) is bought at the individual price `a`.
3. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2`.

The program correctly handles the following scenarios:
- If `b` is less than `2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy pairs of yogurts at the promotional price.
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.
- If `n` is odd, one additional yogurt is bought at the individual price after buying as many pairs as possible.

The program also correctly processes multiple test cases and ensures that the output for each test case is the minimum cost.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
