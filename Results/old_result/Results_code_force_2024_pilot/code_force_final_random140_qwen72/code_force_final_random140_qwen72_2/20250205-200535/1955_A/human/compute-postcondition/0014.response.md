To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\).
   - `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\).

2. **Calculations:**
   - `s1` is calculated as `n * a`.
   - `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

3. **Explanation of `s1` and `s2`:**
   - `s1` is simply the product of `n` and `a`.
   - `s2` is a bit more complex:
     - `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2.
     - `b * (n // 2)` multiplies `b` by the integer division result.
     - `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 (which is either 0 or 1).
     - `n % 2 * a` multiplies `a` by the remainder.
     - `s2` is the sum of these two parts: `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

4. **Determine the minimum of `s1` and `s2`:**
   - The `min(s1, s2)` function will return the smaller of the two values `s1` and `s2`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`.

Output: **min(n * a, b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a) (where n, a, and b are the input integers within their respective ranges)**
