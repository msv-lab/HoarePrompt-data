The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates two values: `s1` as `n * a` and `s2` as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. The function prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
