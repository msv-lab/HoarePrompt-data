The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the new input. The initial values of `s1` and `s2` were calculated based on the old values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, but since `n`, `a`, and `b` are now updated, `s1` and `s2` should also be recalculated using the new values.

However, the code snippet does not explicitly recalculate `s1` and `s2`. Therefore, the values of `s1` and `s2` remain as they were initially calculated.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\), `s1` is equal to the old value of `n * a`, `s2` is equal to the old value of `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.**
