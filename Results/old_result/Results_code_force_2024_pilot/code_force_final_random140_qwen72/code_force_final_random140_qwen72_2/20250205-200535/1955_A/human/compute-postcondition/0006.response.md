The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This operation updates the values of these variables, which were previously defined with certain constraints. The values of `t`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged unless they depend on the new values of `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\)
- `b` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\)
- `s1` is equal to `n * a`
- `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input.
- `s1` and `s2` are not recalculated in the given code snippet, so their values remain as they were initially calculated based on the old values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\), `s1` is equal to the old value of `n * a`, `s2` is equal to the old value of `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.**
