Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it calculates the total cost in two ways:
1. `s1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`n * a`).
2. `s2` is the cost if the maximum number of yogurts are bought at the promotional price (`b * (n // 2)`) and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price (`n % 2 * a`).

The program then prints the minimum of these two costs, which ensures that Maxim spends the least amount of burles to buy exactly `n` yogurts. This approach covers all possible scenarios, including when the promotional price is more expensive than buying individually.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
