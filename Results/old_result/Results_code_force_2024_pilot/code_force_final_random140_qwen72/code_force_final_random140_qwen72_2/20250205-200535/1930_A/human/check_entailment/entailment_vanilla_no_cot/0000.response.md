Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given solution does not correctly solve the problem. The solution simply sums every other element in the list `A`, which does not necessarily give the maximum score as required by the problem statement. To achieve the maximum score, one should sort the array and then sum the first `n` elements (since these will be the minimum values when paired up). Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[:n]))
```

This version sorts the array and then sums the first `n` elements, which ensures the maximum score is achieved by always choosing the smaller of the two numbers in each move.
