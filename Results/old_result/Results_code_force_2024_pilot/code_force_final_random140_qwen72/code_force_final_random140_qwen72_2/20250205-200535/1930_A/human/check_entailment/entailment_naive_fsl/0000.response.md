Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the sum. Instead of selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score, the program simply sums every other element in the list `A`. This approach does not guarantee that the maximum possible score is achieved.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
4 1 2 3
```
The correct output should be 4, because you can choose pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4), which gives a score of 1 + 3 = 4. However, the program will output 5, because it sums the elements at even indices (4 and 1), which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
