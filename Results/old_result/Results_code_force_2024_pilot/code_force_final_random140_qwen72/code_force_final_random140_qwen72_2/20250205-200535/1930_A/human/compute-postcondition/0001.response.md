For the given task, the state right before the while loop is as follows:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

The `while` loop statement is:
```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to check the condition in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000, which means `t` is already non-zero.

Since `t` is already guaranteed to be non-zero (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.**
