Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `n` is now the new input integer.** 

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer provided by the user, while the other variables (`t` and `A`) remain unchanged. The new value of `n` still adheres to the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
