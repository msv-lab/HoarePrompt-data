Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `A`**: The list `A` contains 2n integers. This means it has an even number of elements, specifically 2n elements.
2. **Slicing `A[::2]`**: The slicing operation `A[::2]` selects every second element from the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0). For example, if `A = [a1, a2, a3, a4, ..., a(2n-1), a(2n)]`, then `A[::2]` will be `[a1, a3, a5, ..., a(2n-1)]`.
3. **Summing the Sliced List**: The `sum` function calculates the sum of all elements in the sliced list `A[::2]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of the elements at the odd indices (0-based) of the list `A`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `A` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `A`.

Output: **sum of the elements at the odd indices (0-based) of the list A**.
