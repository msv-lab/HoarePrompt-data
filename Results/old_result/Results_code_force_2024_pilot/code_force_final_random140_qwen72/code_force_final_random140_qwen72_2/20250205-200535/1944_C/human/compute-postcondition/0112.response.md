Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `ans` is the index of the first unique element in `arr` (or the index of the second unique element if the first one was already found), `once` is True if a unique element has been encountered at least once.**

Explanation:
- `t` is still greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1 after the loop finishes.
- `n` remains the new input integer.
- `arr` remains the list of integers from the new input.
- `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`. For example, if `arr` was `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`, `counter` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}`.
- `ans` is the index of the first unique element in `arr` (or the index of the second unique element if the first one was already found). For example, if `arr` was `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`, `ans` would be `0` (index of `1`).
- `once` is True if a unique element has been encountered at least once during the loop execution. If no unique elements are found, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.
