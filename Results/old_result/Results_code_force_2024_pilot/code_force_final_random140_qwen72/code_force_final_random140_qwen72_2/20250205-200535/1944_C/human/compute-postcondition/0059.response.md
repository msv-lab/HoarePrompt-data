Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least two elements, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 1 or incremented by 1 if it already existed, `ans` is the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is True, or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in the old `arr` that appeared exactly once, `i` is the next element in `arr`. The count of `i` in `counter` is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`.**
