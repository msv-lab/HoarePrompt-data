Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, and if `counter.get(i, 0)` is exactly 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to `i + 1`, `once` becomes True, and the state of other variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and if `counter.get(i, 0)` is exactly 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 1. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, then `ans` is 1 and `once` remains False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `ans` is 2 and `once` is set to True. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, then `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 2. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, then `ans` is 1 and `once` remains False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `ans` is 2 and `once` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, then `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
