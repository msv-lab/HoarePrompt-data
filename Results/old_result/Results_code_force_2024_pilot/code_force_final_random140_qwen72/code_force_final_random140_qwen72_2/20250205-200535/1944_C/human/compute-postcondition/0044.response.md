Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 2, `ans` is 2, `once` is True.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `ans`.
- Since `i` is 2, and the conditions mentioned in the initial state are met (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is initially False), `once` becomes True and `ans` is set to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `counter`) remain unchanged.
