Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is exactly 1.**
