To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as this is the typical initialization for a loop that iterates over a range.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `counter` now contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `once` is False.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should be initialized to 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` now contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0**
