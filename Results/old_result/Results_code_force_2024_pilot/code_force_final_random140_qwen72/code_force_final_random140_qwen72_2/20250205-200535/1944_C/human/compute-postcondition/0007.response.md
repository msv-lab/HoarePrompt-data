The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` is the first element in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element in `arr`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two elements, `counter` now contains the first element of `arr` with a count of 1 (or incremented by 1 if it was already present), `i` is the second element in `arr`.**
