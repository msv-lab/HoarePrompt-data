The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but expects input within the function body that includes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it expects an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns the results for all test cases. However, the specific output for each test case is not defined in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns the results for all test cases, though the specific output for each test case is not specified.**
