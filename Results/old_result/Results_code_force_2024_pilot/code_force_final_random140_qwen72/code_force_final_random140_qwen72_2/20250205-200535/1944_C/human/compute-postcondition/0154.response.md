Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. It then determines and prints the smallest index `i` such that the count of `i` in the list is zero, or the smallest index `i` such that the count of `i` is one and it is the first occurrence of such an index. If no such index exists, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects the final values of the last test case processed. **
