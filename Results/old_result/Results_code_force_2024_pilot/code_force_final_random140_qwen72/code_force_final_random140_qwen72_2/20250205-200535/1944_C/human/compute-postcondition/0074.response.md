Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1.**
