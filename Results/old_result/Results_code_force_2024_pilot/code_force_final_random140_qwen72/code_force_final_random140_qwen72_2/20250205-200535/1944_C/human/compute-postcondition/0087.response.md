Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `once` remains False, and the conditions remain unchanged. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`, then `ans` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
