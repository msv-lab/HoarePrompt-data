Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 0, and the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to `i + 1` and `once` becomes True. Otherwise, if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1, `ans` is set to `i` and `once` remains False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is not 1, the state remains unchanged with `ans` being 0 and `once` being False.***
