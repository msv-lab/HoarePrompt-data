Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1, `ans` is set to `i`, `once` remains False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
