Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` now contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, and the current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1, and `once` is still False.**
