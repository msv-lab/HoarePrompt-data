Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly handles the problem as described. It iterates through the numbers from 0 to \(n-1\) and uses a dictionary to count occurrences of each number in the input array. The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the following:

1. If a number \(i\) is missing from the array (i.e., its count is 0), it is immediately chosen as the MEX, since it is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. If a number \(i\) appears exactly once and hasn't been "used" by Alice (tracked by the `once` flag), Alice will choose it to maximize the MEX, and the next number \(i+1\) becomes the candidate for MEX.
3. If a number \(i\) appears exactly once and has already been "used" by Alice, Bob will choose it, and the current number \(i\) is the MEX.

This approach ensures that the game's final score is calculated correctly under the assumption that both players play optimally. The solution also efficiently handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
