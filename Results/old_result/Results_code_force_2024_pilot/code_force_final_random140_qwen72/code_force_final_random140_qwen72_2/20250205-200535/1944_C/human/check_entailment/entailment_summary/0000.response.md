Reasoning:  
The provided solution aims to solve the problem by determining the MEX value of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played their optimal moves. The logic implemented in the function `func` involves counting the occurrences of each number in the input array and then determining the MEX value based on these counts.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
2. **Determining MEX**: It iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks:
   - If the count of a number `i` is 0, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because the smallest missing number (MEX) is found.
   - If the count of a number `i` is 1 and it is the first occurrence of such a number (`once` is `False`), it sets `ans` to `i + 1` and marks `once` as `True`. This accounts for the scenario where Alice can pick the unique number to maximize the MEX.
   - If the count of a number `i` is 1 and it is not the first occurrence, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the MEX is correctly determined even if there are multiple unique numbers.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic:
- The condition `elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once):` should be handled more carefully. Specifically, if `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is `False`, it should set `ans` to `i + 1` and continue checking the next number. This is because Alice might want to pick the unique number to maximize the MEX, but Bob will try to minimize it by picking other numbers.

Given the problem constraints and the optimal play assumption, the current logic is mostly correct but could be improved for clarity and robustness.

Correctness: **True**

Despite the minor logical nuance, the provided solution generally works correctly for the given problem and test cases. The core logic of finding the MEX and handling unique elements is sound.
