You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from heapq import *

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        counter = {}
        for i in arr:
            counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
        ans = 0
        once = False
        for i in range(n):
            if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
                ans = i
                break
            elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once):
                once = True
                ans = i + 1
            elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
                ans = i
                break
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. It then determines and prints the smallest index `i` such that the count of `i` in the list is zero, or the smallest index `i` such that the count of `i` is one and it is the first occurrence of such an index. If no such index exists, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects the final values of the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`. The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`, assuming both players play optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will always try to append the smallest missing number to `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving this by removing the smallest available number that Alice might need.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It creates a counter dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0 and a boolean `once` to track if a number has appeared exactly once.
   - It iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If a number `i` is not present in the array (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and updates `ans` to `i + 1`.
     - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest missing number in the array `arr` and handles the case where a number appears exactly once.
   - The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the smallest missing number and the presence of unique numbers.
   - The program efficiently handles multiple test cases and large input sizes within the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
