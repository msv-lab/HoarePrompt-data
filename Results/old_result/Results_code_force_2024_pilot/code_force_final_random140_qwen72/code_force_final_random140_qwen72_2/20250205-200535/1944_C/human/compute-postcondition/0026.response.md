Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` now contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `i` is 0, and the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0. If the count of `i` in `counter` is exactly 1, `ans` is set to `i`, `once` remains False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
