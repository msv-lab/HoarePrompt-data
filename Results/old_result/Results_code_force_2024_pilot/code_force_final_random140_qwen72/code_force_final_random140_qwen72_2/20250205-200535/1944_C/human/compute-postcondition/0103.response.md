Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `ans` is the index of the first unique element in `arr` (or the index of the second unique element if the first one was already found), and `once` is True if a unique element has been encountered at least once. If no unique elements are found, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.**
