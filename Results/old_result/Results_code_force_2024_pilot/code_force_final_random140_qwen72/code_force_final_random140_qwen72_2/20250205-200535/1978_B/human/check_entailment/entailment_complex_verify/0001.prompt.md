You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        n = x[0]
        a = x[1]
        b = x[2]
        profit = n * a
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        t -= 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        n = x[0]
        
        a = x[1]
        
        b = x[2]
        
        profit = n * a
        
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `x` is the last list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`. If `a` ≥ `b`, `profit` is `n * a`. Otherwise, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`, where `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates a profit value based on these inputs. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit is simply `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex profit value involving the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`. The function prints the calculated profit for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Initial Profit Calculation**:
   - The initial profit is calculated as `n * a`, which is the profit if all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `a >= b`, it means the usual price is greater than or equal to the modified price, so it's better to sell all buns at the usual price. The program correctly prints the initial profit in this case.

4. **Optimal `k` Calculation**:
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal `k` as `b - a`. This is because the modified price starts decreasing from `b` and we want to maximize the profit by choosing the largest possible `k` that still gives a higher price than `a`.
   - The program then ensures `k` does not exceed `n - 1` using `min(n - 1, k)`.

5. **Profit Adjustment**:
   - The profit is adjusted by adding the additional profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
   - The formula used is `profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
     - `(b - a) * (k + 1)` calculates the total additional profit from the first `k` buns.
     - `k * (k + 1) / 2` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the total discount applied to the first `k` buns.
   - The final profit is converted to an integer before printing.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and calculations as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the profit is maximized by considering the optimal `k` and adjusting the profit accordingly.

### Correctness:
**True**
