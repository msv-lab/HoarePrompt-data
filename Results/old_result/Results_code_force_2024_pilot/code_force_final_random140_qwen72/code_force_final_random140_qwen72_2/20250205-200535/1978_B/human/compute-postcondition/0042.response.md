The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 4, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`. If `a` ≥ `b`, `profit` is `n * a`. Otherwise, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`, where `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`.**
