The value of `n` is updated to the first element of the list `x`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged, and the list `x` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is `x[0]`, `a` and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), `x` is a list of integers read from the input.**
