Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 2, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `profit` is `n * a`. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`, and `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, changing its value from an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1 to an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
