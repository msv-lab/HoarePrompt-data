For the given task, the state right before the while loop is as follows: `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9).

The `while` loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy.

Given that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `t` is already guaranteed to be non-zero and thus truthy. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9)**
