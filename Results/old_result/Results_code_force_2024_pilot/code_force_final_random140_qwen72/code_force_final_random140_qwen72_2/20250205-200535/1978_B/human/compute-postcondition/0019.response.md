Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is not yet calculated.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = x[0]` assigns the first element of the list `x` to the variable `n`. Since `n` was already defined as `x[0]` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
