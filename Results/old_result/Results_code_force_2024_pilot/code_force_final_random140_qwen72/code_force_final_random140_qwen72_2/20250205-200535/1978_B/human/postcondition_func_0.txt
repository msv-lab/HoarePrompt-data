The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates a profit value based on these inputs. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit is simply `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex profit value involving the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`. The function prints the calculated profit for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0.
