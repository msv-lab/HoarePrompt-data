Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `profit` is `n * a`, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is `b - a`.** 

The value of `k` is calculated as the difference between `b` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
