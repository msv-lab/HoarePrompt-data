The value of `k` is updated to the minimum of `n - 1` and the original value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 3, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is `n * a`, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`**
