Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1.
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the first element of the list `x` (`x[0]`).
- `a` is the second element of the list `x` (`x[1]`).
- `b` is the third element of the list `x` (`x[2]`).
- `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.
- `profit` is calculated as `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(profit))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Read Input:**
   - `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - Let's assume `x = [n, a, b]` where `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integers.

2. **Calculate `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, `a = 2`, and `b = 7`, then:
     - `n - 1 = 4`
     - `b - a = 5`
     - `k = min(4, 5) = 4`

3. **Calculate `profit`:**
   - `profit` is calculated as `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
   - Using the same example values:
     - `n * a = 5 * 2 = 10`
     - `(b - a) * (k + 1) = 5 * (4 + 1) = 5 * 5 = 25`
     - `k * (k + 1) / 2 = 4 * (4 + 1) / 2 = 4 * 5 / 2 = 10`
     - `profit = 10 + 25 - 10 = 25`

4. **Print `profit` as an integer:**
   - The `print` statement will convert `profit` to an integer and print it.

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the calculation steps, the output will be the integer value of `profit`.

Output: **25 (where profit is calculated as n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2, with n, a, b, and k derived from the input list x)**
