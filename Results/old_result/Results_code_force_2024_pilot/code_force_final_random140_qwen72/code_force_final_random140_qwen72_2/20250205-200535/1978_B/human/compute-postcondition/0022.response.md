Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is `n * a`.**

Explanation: The value of `profit` is now calculated as the product of `n` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
