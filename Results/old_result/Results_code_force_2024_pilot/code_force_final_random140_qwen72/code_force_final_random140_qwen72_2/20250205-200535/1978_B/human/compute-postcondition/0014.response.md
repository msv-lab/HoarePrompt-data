Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is `x[0]`
- `a` is `x[1]`
- `b` is `x[2]`
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input
- `profit` is calculated as `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`
- `a` is less than `b`
- `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.
   - This means `k` is the smaller value between `n - 1` and `b - a`.

2. **Calculate `profit`:**
   - The formula for `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
   - Let's break it down:
     - `n * a` is the product of `n` and `a`.
     - `(b - a) * (k + 1)` is the product of the difference between `b` and `a` and `k + 1`.
     - `k * (k + 1) / 2` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (which is a triangular number).

3. **Combine the parts:**
   - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `x = [5, 2, 4]`:
- `n = x[0] = 5`
- `a = x[1] = 2`
- `b = x[2] = 4`
- `k = min(n - 1, b - a) = min(4, 2) = 2`

Now, calculate `profit`:
- `n * a = 5 * 2 = 10`
- `(b - a) * (k + 1) = (4 - 2) * (2 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`
- `k * (k + 1) / 2 = 2 * 3 / 2 = 3`

So, `profit = 10 + 6 - 3 = 13`.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(profit))` statement will print the integer value of `profit`.

Output: **13 (where profit is the calculated value based on the given formula and input values)**
