The value of `balance` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `balance` depends on the first character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is '(', `balance` was initially 2, so now it is 3. If the first character of `s` is ')', `balance` was initially -2, so now it is -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is 2; `char` is the second character of `s`; `positions` is a list containing two tuples: `(balance, 0, char)` and `(balance, 1, char)`. If the first character of `s` is '(', `balance` is 3. If the first character of `s` is ')', `balance` is -1.**
