The value of `balance` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '(', and -1 if the first character of `s` is ')', the new value of `balance` will be 0 if the first character of `s` is '(', and -2 if the first character of `s` is ')'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is 1; `positions` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, 0, char)` where `balance` is 0 if the first character of `s` is '(', and -2 if the first character of `s` is ')'**.
