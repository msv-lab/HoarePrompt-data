Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is 2; `char` is the second character of `s`; `positions` is a list containing two tuples: `(balance, 0, char)` and `(balance, 1, char)`. If the first character of `s` is '(', and `char` (the second character) is '(', `balance` is 3. If the first character of `s` is '(', and `char` is ')', `balance` is 1. If the first character of `s` is ')', and `char` is '(', `balance` is -1. If the first character of `s` is ')', and `char` is ')', `balance` is -3.***
