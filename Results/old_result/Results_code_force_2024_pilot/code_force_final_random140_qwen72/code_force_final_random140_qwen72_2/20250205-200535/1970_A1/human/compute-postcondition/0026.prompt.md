You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the string); `balance` is 0 (since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence); `positions` is a list containing `n` tuples, each representing the balance, index, and character at each position in the string.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` constructed from the characters in `positions` in the specified order, which is sorted by balance in ascending order and by index in descending order for the same balance. The string `result` is derived from the balanced parentheses sequence `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", where `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a string `result` constructed from characters in `s` sorted by their balance in ascending order and by their index in descending order for the same balance.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `result` constructed from the characters in `positions` in the specified order, which is sorted by balance in ascending order and by index in descending order for the same balance. The string `result` is derived from the balanced parentheses sequence `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
