The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This operation modifies the `results` list by adding a new element at the end. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `count_ones`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing one additional element 'no', `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`.**
