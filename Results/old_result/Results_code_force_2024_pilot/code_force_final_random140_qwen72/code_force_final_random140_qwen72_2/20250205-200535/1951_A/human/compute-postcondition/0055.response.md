Based on the initial state:

- `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements, each element is either 'yes' or 'no'.
- `r` is the third element in the list `results`.

The print statement `print(r)` will print the third element in the list `results`.

Since the exact contents of the `results` list are not specified, we can only describe the value of `r` based on the information given. The third element in the list `results` can either be 'yes' or 'no'.

Output: **r (where r is the third element in the list results, which can be either 'yes' or 'no')**
