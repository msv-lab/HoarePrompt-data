Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing one more element ('yes'), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the string 'yes' to the list `results`. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `count_ones`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The only change is that `results` now contains one additional element, which is 'yes'.
