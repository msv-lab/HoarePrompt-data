To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is `results`. The loop will execute if `results` contains at least one element. The other variables (`start`, `end`, and `t`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to influence the loop's execution directly.

Given that `results` is a list containing `t` elements, and `t` is 0, `results` would initially be an empty list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `results` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element, each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop.**
