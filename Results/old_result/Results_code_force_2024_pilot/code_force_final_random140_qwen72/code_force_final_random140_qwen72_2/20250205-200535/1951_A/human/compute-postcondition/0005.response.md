Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`.** 

Explanation: The variable `count_ones` is assigned the value of the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
