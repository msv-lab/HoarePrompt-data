Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing three elements, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`.
- Initially, `results` contained two elements. After appending `'yes'`, `results` now contains three elements.
- All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `count_ones`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
