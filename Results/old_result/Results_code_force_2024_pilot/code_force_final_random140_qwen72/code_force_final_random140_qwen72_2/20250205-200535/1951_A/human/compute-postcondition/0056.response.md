Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing `n` elements (where `n` is the total number of iterations), each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `start` and `end` are integers where `start` is less than or equal to `end`, and `t` is 0.
- The loop iterates over the `results` list, which initially contains `t` elements (in this case, 0 elements).
- As the loop runs, it prints each element `r` from the `results` list.
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain `n` elements, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has performed.
- Each element in the `results` list will be either 'yes' or 'no', depending on the conditions evaluated during each iteration.
- The variables `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
