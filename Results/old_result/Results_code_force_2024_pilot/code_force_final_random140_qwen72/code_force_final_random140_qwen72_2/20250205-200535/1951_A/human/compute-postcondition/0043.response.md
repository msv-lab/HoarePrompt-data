Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing three elements, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'yes' to the list `results`, increasing its length from 2 to 3. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `count_ones` remain unchanged.
