The code snippet `count_ones = arr.count('1')` calculates the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `arr` and assigns this count to the variable `count_ones`.

Given the initial state:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`
- `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1)
- `results` is a list
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a new input string
- `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`

After executing the code snippet, the only change is in the value of `count_ones`, which is now the number of '1's in the string `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`.**
