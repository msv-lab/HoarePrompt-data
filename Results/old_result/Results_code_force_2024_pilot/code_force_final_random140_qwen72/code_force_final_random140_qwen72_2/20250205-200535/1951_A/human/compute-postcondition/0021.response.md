Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr` which is greater than 0. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains the string 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, and if `count_ones` is 2, `results` contains 'no' if the substring '11' is present in `arr`, or 'yes' if the substring '11' is not present in `arr`. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'yes'.***
