The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range defined by `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`start`, `end`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
