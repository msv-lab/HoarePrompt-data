The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element, and `r` was the last element processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and `r` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, each element is either 'yes' or 'no', `r` is the second element in the list**
