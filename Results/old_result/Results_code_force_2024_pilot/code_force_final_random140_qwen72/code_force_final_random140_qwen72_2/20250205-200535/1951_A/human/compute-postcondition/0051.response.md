To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing at least 1 element, each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `r` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet.
- Given the context, it is likely that `r` is an element from the `results` list, but without more specific information about how `r` is assigned, we cannot determine its exact value.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the possible values it can take from the `results` list. The `results` list contains elements that are either 'yes' or 'no'.

### Final Output:
Output: **r (where r is an element from the results list, which can be either 'yes' or 'no')**
