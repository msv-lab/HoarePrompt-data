The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `arr` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then evaluates whether the string meets specific conditions and appends 'yes' or 'no' to a results list accordingly. Finally, it prints each result in the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After execution, the program state includes a list `results` containing `t` elements, each being 'yes' or 'no'.
