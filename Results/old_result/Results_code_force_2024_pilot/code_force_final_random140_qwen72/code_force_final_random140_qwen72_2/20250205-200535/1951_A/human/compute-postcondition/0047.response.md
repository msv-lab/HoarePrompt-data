Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing three elements, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`. If `count_ones` % 2 != 0, `results` contains the same three elements as before. If `count_ones` == 2 and '11' is in `arr`, `results` contains the additional element 'no'. Otherwise, `results` contains the same three elements as before.***
