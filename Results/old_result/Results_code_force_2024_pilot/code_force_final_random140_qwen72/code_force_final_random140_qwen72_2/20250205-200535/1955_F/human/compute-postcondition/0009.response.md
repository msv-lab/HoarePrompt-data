Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, and `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `int(input())` times, where `input()` is the number of test cases `t`.
- After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `int(input()) - 1` because the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are provided by the user for each test case, and they are processed in each iteration of the loop.
- The initial state variables `t` and `p_i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
