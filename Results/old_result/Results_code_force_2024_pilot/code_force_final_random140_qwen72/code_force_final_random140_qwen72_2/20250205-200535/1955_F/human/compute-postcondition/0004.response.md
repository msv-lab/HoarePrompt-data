Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `p_i`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are now assigned the values provided by the user through the `input()` function, which are split and converted to integers. These new values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are specific integers provided by the user.
