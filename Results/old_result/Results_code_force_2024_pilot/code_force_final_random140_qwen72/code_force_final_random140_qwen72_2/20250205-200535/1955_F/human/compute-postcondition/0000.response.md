To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function, starting from 0.
2. The loop will execute if the value passed to `range` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `p_i` are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, representing the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.

The input to `range` is determined by `int(input())`, which should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input to `range` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 as per the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
