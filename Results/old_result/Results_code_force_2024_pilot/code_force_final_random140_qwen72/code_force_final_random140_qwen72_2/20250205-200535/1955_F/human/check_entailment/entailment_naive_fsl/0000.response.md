Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed. The program uses a simple formula to calculate the number of wins, but it does not consider the optimal strategy for removing numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

For example, consider the input `1 1 1 1`. According to the problem description, Bob can win if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. However, the program's logic does not correctly account for the optimal removal strategy in this case. The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `2` because Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins twice:

1. Remove one '1' and one '3'. The remaining numbers are `[2, 4]`, and their XOR is `6`, which is non-zero (Alice wins).
2. Remove one '2'. The remaining number is `[4]`, and its XOR is `4`, which is non-zero (Alice wins).

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
