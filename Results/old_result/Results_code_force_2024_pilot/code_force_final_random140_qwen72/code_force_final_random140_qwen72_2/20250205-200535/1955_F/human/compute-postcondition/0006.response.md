The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's continuation depends on the value of `i` relative to the upper limit provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and the input value must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, and the input value must be greater than 1**
