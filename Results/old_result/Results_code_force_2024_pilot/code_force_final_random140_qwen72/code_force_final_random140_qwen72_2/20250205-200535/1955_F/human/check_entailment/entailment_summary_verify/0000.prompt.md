You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` (0 <= p_i <= 200), representing counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a sequence. It then calculates and prints a value based on these inputs, which is the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of their remainders when divided by 2 and 3 equals 3. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed. The program uses a simple formula to calculate the number of wins, but it does not consider the optimal strategy for removing numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

For example, consider the input `1 1 1 1`. According to the problem description, Bob can win if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. However, the program's logic does not correctly account for the optimal removal strategy in this case. The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `2` because Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins twice:

1. Remove one '1' and one '3'. The remaining numbers are `[2, 4]`, and their XOR is `6`, which is non-zero (Alice wins).
2. Remove one '2'. The remaining number is `[4]`, and its XOR is `4`, which is non-zero (Alice wins).

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
