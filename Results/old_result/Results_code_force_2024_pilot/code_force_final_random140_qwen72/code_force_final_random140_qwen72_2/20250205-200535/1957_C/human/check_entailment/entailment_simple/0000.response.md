### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the initial moves and processes them to update the available positions on the board.

2. **Processing Initial Moves:**
   - For each initial move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`. If they are different, it reduces `n` by 2 (one for the white rook and one for the black rook). If they are the same, it reduces `n` by 1 (only one rook is placed).

3. **Dynamic Programming Function:**
   - The function `func_1` calls the helper function `helper` with the updated value of `n`.
   - The `helper` function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible configurations. It uses a dictionary `dp` to store intermediate results for memoization.
   - The base case is when `len` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 1.
   - For other values of `len`, it recursively computes the number of configurations using the formula `x1 + x2`, where `x1` is the number of configurations for `len - 1` and `x2` is `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the initial moves.
- The dynamic programming approach used in the `helper` function is appropriate for computing the number of possible configurations.
- The memoization ensures that the function does not recompute values, making it efficient.
- The logic for reducing `n` based on the initial moves is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
