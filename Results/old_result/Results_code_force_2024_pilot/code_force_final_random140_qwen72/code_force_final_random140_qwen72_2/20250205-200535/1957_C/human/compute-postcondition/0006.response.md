The code snippet `x1 = helper(len - 1)` calls the function `helper` with the argument `len - 1` and assigns the return value of this function call to the variable `x1`. Since the function `helper` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the value it returns. However, we can infer that `x1` will hold the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`.

The initial state specifies that `len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not in `dp`. After executing the code, the value of `len` remains unchanged, and `x1` is now assigned the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`.

Output State: **`len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len` is not in `dp`, `x1` is the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`**.
