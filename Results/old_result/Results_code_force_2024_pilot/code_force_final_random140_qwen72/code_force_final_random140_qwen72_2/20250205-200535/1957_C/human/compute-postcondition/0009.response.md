Output State: **`len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len` is in `dp`, `dp[len]` is `x1 + x2`, `x1` is the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`, `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * the value returned by `helper(len - 2)`, `y` is `x1 + x2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y` to `dp[len]`. Since `y` is calculated as `x1 + x2`, and `x1` and `x2` are defined based on the results of the `helper` function calls, the updated state reflects these assignments. The only change is that `len` is now a key in the dictionary `dp` with its value set to `y`. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
