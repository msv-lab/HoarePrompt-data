Output State: **`len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len` is not in `dp`, `x1` is the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`, `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * the value returned by `helper(len - 2)`, `y` is `x1 + x2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is calculated as the sum of `x1` and `x2`.
- `x1` is the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`.
- `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * the value returned by `helper(len - 2)`.
- The values of `len`, `x1`, and `x2` remain unchanged, and `len` is still a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not in `dp`.
