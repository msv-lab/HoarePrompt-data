Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `helper` are intended to calculate the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, but they do not account for the specific rules of the game, such as the mirroring behavior of the computer and the constraints imposed by the initial moves. Additionally, the program does not handle multiple test cases or the input format as specified in the problem statement. The dynamic programming approach used in `helper` is also flawed, as it does not consider the modulo operation required for large numbers, and it does not correctly implement the logic for the game's rules.
