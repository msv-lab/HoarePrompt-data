Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0.** 

The variable `y` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `y`.
