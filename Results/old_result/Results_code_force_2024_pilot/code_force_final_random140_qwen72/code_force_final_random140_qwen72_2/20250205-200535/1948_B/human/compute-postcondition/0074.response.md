Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `c` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `a` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation:
- The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `c`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `i`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The list `c` now contains its previous elements plus the element at index `i` of `a`.
