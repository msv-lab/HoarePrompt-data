Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program attempts to call `func_1()` before it is defined, which will result in a runtime error. The function `func_1()` should be called after it is defined.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements**: The logic for splitting elements into their digits and inserting them back into the array is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for appending digits or the original number to the list `c` are not comprehensive enough to handle all edge cases. For example, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array contains multiple elements greater than 10 in a row.

3. **Incorrect Comparison with Sorted Array**: The program checks if the modified array `c` is equal to its sorted version `d`. However, this approach does not account for the possibility that the array might become sorted through the allowed operations but still not match the exact order of the sorted array due to the way elements are split and inserted.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The expected output is `YES`, because the array can be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the program's logic for splitting and inserting digits is flawed, and it may not correctly handle this transformation, leading to an incorrect output.

### Corrected Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Splitting each element greater than 10 into its digits and inserting them back into the array.
2. Checking if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the function for reference:
```python
def can_be_sorted(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Function to split a number into its digits
        def split_number(num):
            return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
        
        # Apply the operation to each element in the array
        new_a = []
        for num in a:
            if num >= 10:
                new_a.extend(split_number(num))
            else:
                new_a.append(num)
        
        # Check if the new array is sorted
        if new_a == sorted(new_a):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    
    return results

# Example usage
t = int(input())
results = can_be_sorted(t, [])
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the splitting of numbers and checks if the resulting array is sorted.
