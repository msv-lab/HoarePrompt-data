The function `func_1` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with a specific integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function's behavior is not fully specified in the output section, so I will infer from common practices in such scenarios.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.

The function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each. Since the exact output is not specified, I'll assume the function processes the list `a` in some way (e.g., summing the elements, finding the maximum, etc.) and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
