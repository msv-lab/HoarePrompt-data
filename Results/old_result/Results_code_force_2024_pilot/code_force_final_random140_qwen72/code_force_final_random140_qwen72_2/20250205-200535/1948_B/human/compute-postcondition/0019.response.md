Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the element at index `i` in `a` divided by 10, `c` is a list containing either `[y, x]` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or the element at index `i` in `a` if `y` is greater than `x`. `i` is greater than 0, the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than 10, and `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `n - 1` in `c`.***
