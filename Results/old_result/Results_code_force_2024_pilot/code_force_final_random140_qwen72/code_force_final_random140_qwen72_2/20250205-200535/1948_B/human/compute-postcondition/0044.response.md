Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `c` is a list containing the integer division of `a[i-1]` by 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[i-1]`, `y` is the integer division of `a[i-1]` by 10.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `y` (which is the integer division of `a[i-1]` by 10) to the list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `i` is incremented by 1. The new value of `y` is now part of the list `c`.
