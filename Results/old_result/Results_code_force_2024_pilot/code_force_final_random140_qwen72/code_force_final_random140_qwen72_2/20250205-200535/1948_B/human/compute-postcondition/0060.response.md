Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last digit of `a[i-1]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i-1]` divided by 10. If `y` ≤ `x`, `c` is a list containing the integer part of `a[i-1]` divided by 10 and the last digit of `a[i-1]`. Otherwise, `c` is a list containing the element `a[i-1]`.***
