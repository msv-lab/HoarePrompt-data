### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case individually.
   - It also correctly reads the size of the array `k` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the array, processes it, and appends the result (1 for "YES" or 0 for "NO") to the list `b`.

3. **Array Processing**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and checks if the resulting array remains sorted.
   - The program uses a list `c` to store the modified array after splitting elements.
   - It checks if the current element can be split and inserted back into the array while maintaining the sorted order.

4. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted order is flawed. Specifically:
     - The program only checks if the tens digit (`y`) is less than or equal to the units digit (`x`) and if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the previous element in the list `c`.
     - This approach does not account for the possibility that the units digit might need to be inserted before the tens digit in some cases to maintain the sorted order.
     - The program also does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split and reinserted in a way that maintains the sorted property.

5. **Sorting Check**:
   - After processing the array, the program sorts the list `c` and checks if the modified array `c` is equal to the sorted version of `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it appends 0.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program may fail in edge cases where the array has multiple elements that need to be split and reinserted in a specific order to maintain the sorted property.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split 12 to `[1, 2, 28, 5]` and then split 28 to `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`. The final array is not sorted, so the output should be "NO". However, the program might incorrectly handle this case due to the flawed logic.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Splitting 45: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`
  - Splitting 67: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - The final array is sorted, so the output should be "YES".

- **Test Case 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 28, 5]`
  - Splitting 28: `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`
  - The final array is not sorted, so the output should be "NO".

- **Test Case 3**: `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted, so the output should be "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted order is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases. The issues identified in the original assessment are accurate.

### Correctness:
