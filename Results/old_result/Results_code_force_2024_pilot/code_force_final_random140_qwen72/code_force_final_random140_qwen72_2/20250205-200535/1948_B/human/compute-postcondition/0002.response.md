The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the string `a` into a list of integers. Each element in the list is an integer obtained by splitting the string `a` by whitespace and converting each resulting substring into an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a string input by the user.
- `k` is an input integer.

After executing the code:
- `a` is now a list of integers.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer.**
