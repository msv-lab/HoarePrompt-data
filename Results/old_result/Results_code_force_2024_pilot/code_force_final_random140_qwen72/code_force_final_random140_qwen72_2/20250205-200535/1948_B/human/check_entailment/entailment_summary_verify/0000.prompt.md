You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function transforms the list `a` into a new list `c` based on specific conditions: if an element in `a` is greater than 10, it is split into its tens and units digits, and these digits are added to `c` under certain conditions. After processing, the function checks if the list `c` is sorted. If `c` is sorted, the function appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the list `b` to contain the results of the test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program attempts to call `func_1()` before it is defined, which will result in a runtime error. The function `func_1()` should be called after it is defined.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements**: The logic for splitting elements into their digits and inserting them back into the array is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for appending digits or the original number to the list `c` are not comprehensive enough to handle all edge cases. For example, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array contains multiple elements greater than 10 in a row.

3. **Incorrect Comparison with Sorted Array**: The program checks if the modified array `c` is equal to its sorted version `d`. However, this approach does not account for the possibility that the array might become sorted through the allowed operations but still not match the exact order of the sorted array due to the way elements are split and inserted.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The expected output is `YES`, because the array can be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the program's logic for splitting and inserting digits is flawed, and it may not correctly handle this transformation, leading to an incorrect output.

### Corrected Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Splitting each element greater than 10 into its digits and inserting them back into the array.
2. Checking if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the function for reference:
```python
def can_be_sorted(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Function to split a number into its digits
        def split_number(num):
            return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
        
        # Apply the operation to each element in the array
        new_a = []
        for num in a:
            if num >= 10:
                new_a.extend(split_number(num))
            else:
                new_a.append(num)
        
        # Check if the new array is sorted
        if new_a == sorted(new_a):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    
    return results

# Example usage
t = int(input())
results = can_be_sorted(t, [])
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the splitting of numbers and checks if the resulting array is sorted.
