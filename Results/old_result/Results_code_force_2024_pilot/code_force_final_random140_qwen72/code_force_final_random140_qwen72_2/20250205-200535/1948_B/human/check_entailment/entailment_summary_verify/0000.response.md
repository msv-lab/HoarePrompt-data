### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the provided function `func_1` to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program calls `func_1()` before it is defined, which will result in a runtime error. This is indeed a valid issue.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements**:
   - The logic for splitting elements into their digits and inserting them back into the array is flawed. The conditions for appending digits or the original number to the list `c` are not comprehensive enough to handle all edge cases. For example, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array contains multiple elements greater than 10 in a row.
   - The original assessment provides a good example of this issue: the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]` should be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, but the program's logic may not handle this correctly.

3. **Incorrect Comparison with Sorted Array**:
   - The program checks if the modified array `c` is equal to its sorted version `d`. However, this approach does not account for the possibility that the array might become sorted through the allowed operations but still not match the exact order of the sorted array due to the way elements are split and inserted.
   - For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program might incorrectly append the digits in a way that does not preserve the sorted order.

#### Additional Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle edge cases well. For instance, if the array contains elements like `[10, 11, 12]`, the program might not correctly split and insert the digits to ensure the array remains sorted.
  - The program also does not handle cases where the array is already sorted but contains elements greater than 10.

- **Corrected Approach**:
  - The suggested corrected approach in the original assessment is sound. It involves:
    1. Splitting each element greater than 10 into its digits and inserting them back into the array.
    2. Checking if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - This approach ensures that the program correctly handles the splitting of numbers and checks if the resulting array is sorted.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program's logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted order is flawed, and it does not handle multiple test cases correctly. The suggested corrected approach is a valid solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
