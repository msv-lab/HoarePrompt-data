The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Here, `x` is the last digit of `a[i-1]`, and `c` already contains the integer part of `a[i-1]` divided by 10. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `c` is a list containing the integer part of `a[i-1]` divided by 10 and the last digit of `a[i-1]`, `x` is the last digit of `a[i-1]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i-1]` divided by 10.**
