Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths, `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
