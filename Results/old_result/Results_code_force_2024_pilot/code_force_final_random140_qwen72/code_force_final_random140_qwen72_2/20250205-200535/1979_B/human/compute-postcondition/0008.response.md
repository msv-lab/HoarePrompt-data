Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2` and must be non-zero, `y` is the integer provided by the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2, x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is already updated to `x // 2` and must be non-zero, the new value of `x % 2` is appended to `l1`, making `l1` contain two elements, both of which are `x % 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
