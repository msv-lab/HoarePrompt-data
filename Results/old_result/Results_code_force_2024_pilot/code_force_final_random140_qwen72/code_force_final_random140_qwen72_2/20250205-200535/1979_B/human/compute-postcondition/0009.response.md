Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2` (and must be non-zero), `y` is the integer provided by the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2, x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using integer division. Since `x` must be non-zero, the new value of `x` will also be non-zero.
- The values of `y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
