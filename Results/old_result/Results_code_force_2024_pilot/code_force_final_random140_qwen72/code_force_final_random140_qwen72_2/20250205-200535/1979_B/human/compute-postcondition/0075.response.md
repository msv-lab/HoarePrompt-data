Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `y` is non-zero.
- In each iteration, the remainder of `y` divided by 2 (`y % 2`) is appended to `l2`, and `y` is then divided by 2 (`y //= 2`).
- This process continues until `y` becomes 0.
- The list `l2` will contain the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order.
- The variables `x`, `t`, `l1`, `n`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
