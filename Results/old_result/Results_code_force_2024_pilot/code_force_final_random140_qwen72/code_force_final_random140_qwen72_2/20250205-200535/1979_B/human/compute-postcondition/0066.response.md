The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `y` are input integers. For the loop to execute at least once, `y` must be non-zero.

State: **`x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**
