The function `func` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.

However, since the specific output conditions or logic are not provided, I cannot accurately describe the return value. If you could provide more details about what the function returns based on the values of `x` and `y`, I would be able to complete the description.

For now, based on the given information:
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are distinct non-negative integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.**
