Output State: **`x` is a non-zero integer greater than 0 and is now `x // 2` (where `x` was an even number greater than 2 before the division), `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are `x % 2` and the third element is also `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `i` is 0, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**
