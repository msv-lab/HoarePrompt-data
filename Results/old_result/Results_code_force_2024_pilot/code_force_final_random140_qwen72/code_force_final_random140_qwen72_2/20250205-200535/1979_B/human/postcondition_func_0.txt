The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9). It then computes the number of leading matching bits in the binary representations of `x` and `y`. Finally, it prints 2 raised to the power of the count of these leading matching bits. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `x` and `y` are both 0, `t` is 0, and the lists `l1` and `l2` contain the binary representations of the last `x` and `y` inputs in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths. The variable `n` is the length of these lists, and `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits.
