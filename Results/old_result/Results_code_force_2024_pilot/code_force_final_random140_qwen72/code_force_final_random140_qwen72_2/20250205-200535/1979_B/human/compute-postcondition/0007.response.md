The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is now `x // 2` and must be non-zero. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be non-zero after being halved.

State: **`x` is now `x // 2` and must be non-zero, `y` is the integer provided by the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2]` (where `x` is the new value of `x`), `l2` is an empty list**
