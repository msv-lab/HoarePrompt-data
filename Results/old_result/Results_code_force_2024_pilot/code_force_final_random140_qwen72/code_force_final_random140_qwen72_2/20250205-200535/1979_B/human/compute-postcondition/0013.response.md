Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero.
- In each iteration, the remainder of `x` when divided by 2 (`x % 2`) is appended to the list `l1`.
- After appending, `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which effectively shifts the bits of `x` to the right.
- This process continues until `x` becomes 0, meaning all bits of the initial `x` have been processed.
- The list `l1` will contain the binary representation of the initial `x`, but in reverse order because the remainders are appended from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.
- The variable `y` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `t` must still be greater than 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- The placeholder `_` is not explicitly set and remains unchanged.
- The list `l2` remains empty as it is not modified by the loop.
