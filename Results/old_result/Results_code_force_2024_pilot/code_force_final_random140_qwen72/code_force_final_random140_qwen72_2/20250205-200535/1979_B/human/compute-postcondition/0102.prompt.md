Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, an additional 0 is appended to `l2` to make its length equal to the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1`, and `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`), `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`), `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`), `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
