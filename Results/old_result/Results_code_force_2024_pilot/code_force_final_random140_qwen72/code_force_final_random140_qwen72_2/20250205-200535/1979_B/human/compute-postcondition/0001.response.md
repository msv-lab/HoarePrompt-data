The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `t`, so we can only adjust `t` and `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts.

State: **x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, t must be greater than 0, _ is a placeholder and not explicitly set**
