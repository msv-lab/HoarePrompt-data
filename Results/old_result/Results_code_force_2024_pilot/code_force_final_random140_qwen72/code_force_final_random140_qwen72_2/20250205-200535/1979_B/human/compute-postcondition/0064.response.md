Output State: **`x` is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and must be at least 0.5, `y` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is [x % 2, x % 2, x % 2], `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `x` is halved using the floor division operator `//`. Since `x` was initially a non-zero integer divided by 4 and must be at least 1, after dividing by 2, `x` is now a non-zero integer divided by 8 and must be at least 0.5. All other variables remain unchanged.
