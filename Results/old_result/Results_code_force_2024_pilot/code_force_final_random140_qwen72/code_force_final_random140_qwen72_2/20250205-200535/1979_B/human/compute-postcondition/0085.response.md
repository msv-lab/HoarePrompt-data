The code snippet assigns the length of `l2` to the variable `n`. Since the length of `l2` was made equal to the length of `l1` by appending an additional 0, `n` now holds the value of the length of `l1`.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended to make its length equal to the length of `l1`, `n` is the length of `l1`, and `cnt` is 0.**
