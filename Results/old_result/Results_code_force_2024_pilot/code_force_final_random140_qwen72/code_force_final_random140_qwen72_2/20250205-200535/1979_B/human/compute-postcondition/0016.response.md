The value of `y` is updated to `y // 2`, which means `y` is divided by 2 and the result is stored back in `y`. The floor division ensures that the result is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input divided by 2 (and must be non-zero), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit (LSB) of the original `y`.**
