The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means the values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided.

Since the initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `t` must be greater than 0, the only change is in the values of `x` and `y` which are now determined by the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are the integers provided by the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set.**
