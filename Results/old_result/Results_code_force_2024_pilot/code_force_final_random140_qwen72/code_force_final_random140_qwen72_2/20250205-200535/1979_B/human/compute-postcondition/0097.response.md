Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`), `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
