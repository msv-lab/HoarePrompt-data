The code snippet `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 to the list `l1`. Since `x` is a non-zero integer, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is even or odd. The list `l1` was initially empty, so now it contains one element which is the result of `x % 2`.

Output State: **`x` is a non-zero integer, `y` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is [x % 2], `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**
