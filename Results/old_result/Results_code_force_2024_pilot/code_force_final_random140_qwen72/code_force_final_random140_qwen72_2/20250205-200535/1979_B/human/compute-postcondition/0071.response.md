Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is now `y // 2` and must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2` (with one additional element added), `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `y` is updated to `y // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to `y // 2`, which means `y` is divided by 2 using integer division. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `y` is still required to be greater than 0.
