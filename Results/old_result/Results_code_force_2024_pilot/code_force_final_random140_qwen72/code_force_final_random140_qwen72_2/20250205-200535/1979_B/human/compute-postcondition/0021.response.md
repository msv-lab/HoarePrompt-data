Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input divided by 4 (and must be non-zero), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit (LSB) of the original `y` and the new least significant bit (LSB) of `y` after the operation, and `l2` now contains one additional element which is the new least significant bit (LSB) of `y`.**
