The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `cnt` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, the new value of `cnt` will be 1 or 2, respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`), `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
