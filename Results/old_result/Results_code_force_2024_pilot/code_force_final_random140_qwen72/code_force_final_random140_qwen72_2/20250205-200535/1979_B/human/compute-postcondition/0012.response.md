Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2` (and must be non-zero, implying `x` was at least 2 before the division), `y` is the integer provided by the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2, x % 2, x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`. Since `x` was at least 2 before the division, it remains non-zero after the division.
- The values of `y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
- The list `l1` still contains three elements, each being the result of `x % 2` after the division.
- `l2` remains an empty list.
