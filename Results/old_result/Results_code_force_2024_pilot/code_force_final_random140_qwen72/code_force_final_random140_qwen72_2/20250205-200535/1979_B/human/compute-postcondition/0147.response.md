The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, we need to consider the conditions under which `cnt` was initially set:

- If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 1.
- If `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since the code snippet `cnt += 1` is executed, it implies that `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]` and `cnt` was initially 1. Therefore, after executing `cnt += 1`, the value of `cnt` becomes 2.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths, `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2.**
