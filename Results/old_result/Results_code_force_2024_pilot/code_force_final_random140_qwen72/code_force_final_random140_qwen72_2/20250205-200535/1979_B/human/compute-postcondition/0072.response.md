The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is now `y // 2` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must still be greater than 0 after the division.

State: **`x` is 0, `y` is now `y // 2` and must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2` (with one additional element added), `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**
