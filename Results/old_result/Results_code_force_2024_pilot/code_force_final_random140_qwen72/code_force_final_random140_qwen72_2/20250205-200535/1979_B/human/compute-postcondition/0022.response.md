Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input divided by 8 (and must be non-zero), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit (LSB) of the original `y` and the new least significant bit (LSB) of `y` after the operation, and `l2` now contains one additional element which is the new least significant bit (LSB) of `y`.**

Explanation:
- `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 using integer division, effectively shifting the bits of `y` one position to the right. Since `y` was initially the integer provided by the input divided by 4, after this operation, `y` becomes the integer provided by the input divided by 8.
- The values of `x`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, and the structure of `l2` remain unchanged, but the content of `l2` is updated to reflect the new least significant bit of `y` after the operation.
