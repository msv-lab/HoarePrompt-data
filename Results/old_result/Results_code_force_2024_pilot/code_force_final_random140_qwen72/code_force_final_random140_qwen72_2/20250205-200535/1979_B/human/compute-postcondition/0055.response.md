The provided code snippet resets the lists `l1` and `l2` to empty lists. This impacts the initial state where `l1` and `l2` were previously defined as lists containing the binary representations of `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively. The lengths of these lists (`n`) and the count of leading matching bits (`cnt`) are also affected because they depend on the contents of `l1` and `l2`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**
