Postcondition: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the lengths of `l1` and `l2` equal, if `len(l1) < len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, making the lengths of `l1` and `l2` equal, `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is 0, otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.**
