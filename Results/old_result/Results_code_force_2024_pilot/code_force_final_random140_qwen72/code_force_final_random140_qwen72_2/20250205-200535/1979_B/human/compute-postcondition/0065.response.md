Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero.
- In each iteration, the remainder of `x` when divided by 2 (`x % 2`) is appended to the list `l1`.
- After appending, `x` is divided by 2 using integer division (`x //= 2`).
- This process repeats until `x` becomes 0.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0.
- The list `l1` will contain the binary digits of the original `x`, but in reverse order because the remainders are appended from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.
- The other variables (`y`, `t`, `_`, `l2`, `n`, `cnt`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
