Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2` (and must be non-zero, implying `x` was at least 2 before the division), `y` is the integer provided by the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2, x % 2, x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is now `x // 2` and must be non-zero, the value of `x % 2` is either 0 or 1. The list `l1` initially contains `[x % 2, x % 2]`, and after appending `x % 2` again, it becomes `[x % 2, x % 2, x % 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
