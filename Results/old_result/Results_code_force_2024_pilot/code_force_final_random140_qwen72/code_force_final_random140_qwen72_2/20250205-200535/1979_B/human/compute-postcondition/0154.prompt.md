Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `y` in reverse order. If `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the lengths of `l1` and `l2` equal. If `len(l1) < len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, making the lengths of `l1` and `l2` equal. `n` is the length of `l1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths (if necessary, additional 0s were appended to make their lengths equal), `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 1. If `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths, `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is set to 2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths, `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
