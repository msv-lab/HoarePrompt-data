The code snippet `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to the list `l2`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `l2` is initially an empty list. After the code executes, `l2` will contain one element, which is the remainder of `y` divided by 2.
- The value of `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `y` is even or odd.
- All other variables (`x`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is 0, `y` is the second integer from the user input and must be non-zero, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**
