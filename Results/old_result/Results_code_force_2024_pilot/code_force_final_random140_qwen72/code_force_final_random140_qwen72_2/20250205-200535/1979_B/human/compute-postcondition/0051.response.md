Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set
- `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order
- `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Binary Representation of `x` and `y`:**
   - Since `x` is 0, the binary representation of `x` is `0`.
   - Since `y` is 0, the binary representation of `y` is `0`.

2. **Lists `l1` and `l2`:**
   - `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of `x` in reverse order. Therefore, `l1 = [0]`.
   - `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of `y` in reverse order. Therefore, `l2 = [0]`.

3. **Adjusting List Lengths:**
   - The condition states that if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended. However, both `l1` and `l2` have the same length (1), so no adjustment is needed.
   - The condition also states that if `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended. Since `len(l1) == len(l2)`, `l1` will have an additional 0 appended.
   - After appending, `l1 = [0, 0]` and `l2 = [0]`.

4. **Length of `l1`:**
   - `n` is the length of `l1`, so `n = 2`.

5. **Counting Leading Matching Bits (`cnt`):**
   - We need to count the number of leading matching bits between `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the shorter list.
   - The first bit of `l1` is 0 and the first bit of `l2` is 0, so they match.
   - The second bit of `l1` is 0, but there is no second bit in `l2`, so they do not match.
   - Therefore, `cnt = 1`.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2 ** cnt)`.
   - Since `cnt = 1`, `2 ** cnt = 2 ** 1 = 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
