Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` must be non-zero, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2`, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` is non-zero, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
