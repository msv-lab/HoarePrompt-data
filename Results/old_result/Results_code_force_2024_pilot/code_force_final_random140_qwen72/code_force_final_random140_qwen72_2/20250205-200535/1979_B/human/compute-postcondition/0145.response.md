Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths (if necessary, additional 0s were appended to make their lengths equal), `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 1. If `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
