The value `y % 2` is appended to the list `l2`. This means that `l2` now contains one additional element, which is the result of `y % 2`. All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is now `y // 2` and must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2` (with one additional element added), `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**
