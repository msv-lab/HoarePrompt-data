The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `y` is the integer provided by the input. For the loop to execute the first time, `y` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input and must be non-zero, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list**
