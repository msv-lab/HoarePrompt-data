Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `itest` is 1, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are the input integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the result of `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and the result of `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is also greater than `k`.***
