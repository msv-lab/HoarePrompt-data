Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `itest` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.** 

The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now updated to the integers provided by the user input. The conditions regarding the relationships between `n`, `m`, and `k` (whether `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the result of `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`) are not evaluated by the given code snippet, so they remain unchanged in the output state. The values of `t` and `itest` remain as specified in the initial state.
