Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic checks if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The conditions `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` are used to determine if Bob can always repaint the ribbon to a single color, which aligns with the problem's requirements. If either condition is true, it means Bob can achieve his goal, so the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can prevent Bob from achieving his goal. This matches the expected behavior based on the problem statement and examples provided.
