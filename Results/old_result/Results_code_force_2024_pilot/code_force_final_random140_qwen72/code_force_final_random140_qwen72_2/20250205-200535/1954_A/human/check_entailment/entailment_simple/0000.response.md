Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color after repainting up to `k` parts. The key conditions to consider are:

1. If `n` (the number of parts) is less than or equal to `k` (the number of parts Bob can repaint), then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, regardless of how Alice paints them. Therefore, the answer is "NO".
2. If `n` is greater than `k`, we need to check if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is possible if the number of distinct colors Alice can use (`m`) is large enough to ensure that even after Bob repaints `k` parts, not all parts can be made the same color. Specifically, if `n - math.ceil(n / m) > k`, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

Let's break down the logic in the provided program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. It checks two conditions:
   - If `n <= k`, it prints "NO" because Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, it also prints "NO" because Bob can still make all parts the same color by repainting up to `k` parts.
   - Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

The logic in the program correctly implements the conditions described above. The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` ensures that we account for the minimum number of parts that must be different colors to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
