Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "Yes". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state is such that `t` is 0, `itest` is `t-1`, and the inputs for each test case have been processed and the corresponding output has been printed. **
