### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify it against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Conditions Checked:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `if n <= k`: This condition checks if the total number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
     2. `if n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be different to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than or equal to `k`. If this is true, Bob can also achieve his goal, so the answer is 'NO'.

3. **Output:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Analysis of Conditions:

- **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
  - If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. This condition is correct.

- **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**
  - This condition is intended to check if the number of parts that need to be different to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color is less than or equal to `k`.
  - The expression `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that must be painted with different colors to ensure that not all parts can be made the same color by Bob.
  - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, it means Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1: `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`**
  - `n <= k` is true (1 <= 1), so the answer is 'NO'. Correct.

- **Example 2: `n = 5, m = 1, k = 1`**
  - `n <= k` is false (5 <= 1), but `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is true (5 - 5 <= 1), so the answer is 'NO'. Correct.

- **Example 3: `n = 5, m = 2, k = 1`**
  - `n <= k` is false (5 <= 1), and `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is false (5 - 3 <= 1), so the answer is 'Yes'. Correct.

- **Example 4: `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2`**
  - `n <= k` is false (5 <= 2), and `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is true (5 - 3 <= 2), so the answer is 'NO'. Correct.

- **Example 5: `n = 5, m = 5, k = 3`**
  - `n <= k` is false (5 <= 3), and `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` is false (5 - 1 <= 3), so the answer is 'Yes'. Correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The conditions checked are appropriate and cover all the necessary cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
