To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, as the range function will generate values from 0 to `t-1` (inclusive). The variable `itest` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50

We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `itest` should be set to 0 initially.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0**
