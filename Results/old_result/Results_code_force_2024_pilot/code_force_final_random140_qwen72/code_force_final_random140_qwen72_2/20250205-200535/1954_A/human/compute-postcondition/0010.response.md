To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `itest` is 1.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
   - The condition is checked: if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, both `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is also greater than `k`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition checks two scenarios:
     - `n <= k`
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`
   - If either of these conditions is true, the condition is satisfied.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, the condition is not satisfied.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This means that the print statement will execute only if the condition is not satisfied.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the condition is not satisfied (both `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) > k`), the print statement `print('NO')` will execute.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
