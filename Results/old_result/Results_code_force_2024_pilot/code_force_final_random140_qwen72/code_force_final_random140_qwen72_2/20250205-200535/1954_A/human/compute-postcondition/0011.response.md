To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `itest` is 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- The condition is that if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the result of `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and the result of `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is also greater than `k`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: `n <= k`
   - If this condition is true, the overall condition is satisfied.
2. **Condition 2**: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`
   - If this condition is true, the overall condition is satisfied.
3. **Otherwise**:
   - If both conditions are false, then `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) > k`.

Given the initial state, the code will execute the `print('Yes')` statement if either of the conditions is true. Since the initial state specifies that the condition is satisfied, the `print('Yes')` statement will be executed.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
