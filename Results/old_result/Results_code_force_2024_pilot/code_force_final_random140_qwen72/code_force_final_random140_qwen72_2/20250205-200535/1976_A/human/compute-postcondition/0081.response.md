Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character, otherwise `letters` remains an empty string, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` remains an empty string, `ch` is the next character in `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` now contains `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` now contains the current character `ch`. `password` must have at least one more character left. `letters` is updated to include the current character `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character.**
