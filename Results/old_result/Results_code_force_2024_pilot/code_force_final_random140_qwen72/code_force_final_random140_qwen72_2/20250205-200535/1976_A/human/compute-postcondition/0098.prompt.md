You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) and a string s of length n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits
            [0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that has exactly `t` tuples, `results` is a list that contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions evaluated for each corresponding tuple in `test_cases`. For each tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases`, the string `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and the string `digits` contains all digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, each of which is either 'NO' or 'YES'. Each element in `results` corresponds to a tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases` and indicates whether the conditions for the letters and digits in `password` are met. If the letters or digits are not sorted in ascending order, or if the last letter appears before the first digit in `password`, the element is 'NO'. Otherwise, the element is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns a list `results` with `t` elements, each being 'NO' or 'YES'. For each tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO' if the letters or digits in `password` are not sorted in ascending order, or if the last letter appears before the first digit in `password`. Otherwise, the element is 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, each of which is either 'NO' or 'YES'. Each element in `results` corresponds to a tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases` and indicates whether the conditions for the letters and digits in `password` are met. If the letters or digits are not sorted in ascending order, or if the last letter appears before the first digit in `password`, the element is 'NO'. Otherwise, the element is 'YES'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
