To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

- The loop head is: `for ch in password:`
- The loop will execute if `password` is a non-empty string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples.
- `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions.
- `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string.
- `letters` is an empty string.
- `digits` is an empty string.

For the loop to execute, `password` must be a non-empty string. Since `password` is already specified as the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, no adjustment is needed for `password`.

However, the loop variable `ch` is not part of the initial state, but it will be set by the loop itself as it iterates over `password`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `password` is a non-empty string, which is already guaranteed by the initial state. No further adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is an empty string, and `digits` is an empty string.**
