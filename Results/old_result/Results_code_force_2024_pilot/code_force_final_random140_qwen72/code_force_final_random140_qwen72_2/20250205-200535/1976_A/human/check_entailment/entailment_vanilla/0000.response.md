### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password into two separate strings.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - **Sorted Order Check:**
     - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the original lists with their sorted versions.
     - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - **Digit After Letter Check:**
     - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by comparing the indices of the last letter and the first digit.
     - If such a condition is found, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it appends 'YES' to the results.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It correctly separates letters and digits and checks the sorting conditions.
- It also correctly checks the condition where a digit should not come after a letter.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
