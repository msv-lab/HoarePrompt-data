The only object in the loop head is the variable `ch`, which iterates over the characters in the `password` string. The state of `ch` changes with each iteration as it takes on the value of the next character in `password`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ch` was the first character of `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ch` must now be the second character of `password`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string. If the first character of `password` (`ch`) is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If the first character of `password` (`ch`) is a digit, `digits` is a string containing the first character of `password`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If the first character of `password` (`ch`) is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings. Now, `ch` is the second character of `password`.**
