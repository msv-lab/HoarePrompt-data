Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string. After the loop has completed all iterations, `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. Additionally, either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order, or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order.**
