Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) and a string s of length n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, password in test_cases:
    letters = ''
    digits = ''
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isalpha():
            letters += ch
        elif ch.isdigit():
            digits += ch
    if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(
        digits[0]):
        results.append('NO')
    else:
        results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions. `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, `results` contains the string 'NO'. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, `results` contains the string 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from `password`. If either the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order or the digit characters in `digits` are not in sorted order, `results` contains the string 'NO'. After the if-else block, if `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, `results` contains one additional 'NO' at the end. Otherwise, `results` contains an additional 'YES' at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions. `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all digit characters from `password`. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, `results` contains the string 'NO'. Otherwise, if either `letters` is empty, `digits` is empty, or the last character in `letters` appears at an index in `password` that is less than or equal to the index of the first character in `digits`, `results` contains an additional 'YES'. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, `results` contains the string 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
