The code snippet `digits += ch` appends the value of `ch` to the string `digits`. Given the initial state, `ch` is the second character of `password`, which is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`. If `ch` is not an alphabetic character, it will be appended to `digits`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `digits` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the impact:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (unchanged).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples (unchanged).
- `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions (unchanged).
- `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases` (unchanged).
- `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string (unchanged).
- `ch` is the second character of `password` (unchanged).

If `ch` is not an alphabetic character:
- `digits` is updated to include `ch`.
- `letters` remains an empty string.

If `ch` is an alphabetic character:
- `digits` remains an empty string.
- `letters` contains `ch`.

Since the code snippet only affects `digits` and `ch` is not an alphabetic character, `digits` is updated to include `ch`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character of `password`, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is a string containing `ch` if `ch` is not an alphabetic character, otherwise `digits` remains an empty string.**
