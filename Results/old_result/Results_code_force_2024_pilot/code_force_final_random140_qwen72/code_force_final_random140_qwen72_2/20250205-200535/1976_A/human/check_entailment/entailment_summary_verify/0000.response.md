### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Password Composition**: The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **No Digit After Letter**: There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. **Sorted Digits**: All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Sorted Letters**: All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores the test cases in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - It separates the letters and digits from the password.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Sorting Check**: The program uses `sorted(letters)` and `sorted(digits)` to check if the letters and digits are sorted.
   - **No Digit After Letter**: The program checks if the last letter appears before the first digit using `password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])`.

#### Function Summary Verification:
- **Sorting of Letters and Digits**: The function correctly checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **No Digit After Letter**: The function correctly checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter.

#### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- **Empty Password**: The program handles empty passwords correctly because the conditions will trivially be true.
- **Only Letters or Only Digits**: The program handles these cases correctly as the conditions will be trivially true.
- **Mixed Characters**: The program correctly handles mixed characters by ensuring the sorting and no digit after letter conditions.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case: Single Character Password**: The program should handle single-character passwords correctly. For example, a single letter or a single digit should be considered valid.
- **Edge Case: All Digits or All Letters**: The program should handle these cases correctly, which it does by checking the conditions trivially.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
