### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password into two separate strings.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - **Sorted Order Check:**
     - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the original lists with their sorted versions.
     - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - **Digit After Letter Check:**
     - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by comparing the indices of the last letter and the first digit.
     - If such a condition is found, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it appends 'YES' to the results.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list. This is validated by the annotated code state before the function call.

- **Function Definition:**
  - The function `func_1` processes each test case correctly by separating letters and digits.
  - The separation logic is sound and ensures that `letters` and `digits` contain the respective characters from the password.

- **Condition Checking:**
  - **Sorted Order Check:**
    - The program checks if the letters and digits are sorted by comparing the original strings with their sorted versions. This is a valid approach.
  - **Digit After Letter Check:**
    - The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by comparing the indices of the last letter and the first digit. This is also a valid approach.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the results for each test case based on the conditions checked.
