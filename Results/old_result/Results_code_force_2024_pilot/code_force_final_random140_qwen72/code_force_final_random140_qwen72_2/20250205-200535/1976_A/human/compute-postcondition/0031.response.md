Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions. `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, `results` contains the string 'NO'. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, `results` contains the string 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'YES'.***
