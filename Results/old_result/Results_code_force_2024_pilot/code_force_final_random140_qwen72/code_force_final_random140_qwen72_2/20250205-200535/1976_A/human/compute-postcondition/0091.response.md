The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation changes the content of the `results` list but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that now contains the string 'NO', `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all digit characters from `password`. Both `letters` and `digits` are non-empty, and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, `results` contains the string 'NO'.**
