The only object in the loop head is the variable `ch` from the string `password`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `password`. If there are characters left in `password`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ch` was the current character being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `ch` must be set to the next character in `password`.

Given that `password` is a non-empty string, if the loop has just processed the first character, then `ch` should now be the second character of `password` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character, otherwise `letters` remains an empty string, and `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` remains an empty string, `ch` is the next character in `password`**
