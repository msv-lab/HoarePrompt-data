Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character of `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch` and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is not an alphabetic character, `letters` remains an empty string and `digits` is a string containing `ch` if it is a digit, otherwise `digits` remains an empty string. After the code execution, `letters` is a string containing `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character, otherwise `letters` remains unchanged.**
