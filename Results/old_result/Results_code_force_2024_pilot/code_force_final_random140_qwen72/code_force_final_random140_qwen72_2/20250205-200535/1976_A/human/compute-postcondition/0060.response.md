Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from `password`. If either the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order or the digit characters in `digits` are not in sorted order, `results` contains the string 'NO'. Additionally, `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty, and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`. `results` now contains one additional 'NO' at the end.**
