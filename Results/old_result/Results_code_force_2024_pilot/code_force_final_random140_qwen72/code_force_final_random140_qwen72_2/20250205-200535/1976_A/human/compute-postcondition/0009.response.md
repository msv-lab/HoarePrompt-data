The code snippet `digits += ch` appends the first character of `password` (which is a digit) to the string `digits`. Since `digits` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `digits` will contain the first character of `password`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is a string containing the first character of `password`, `ch` is the first character of `password` and is a digit.**
