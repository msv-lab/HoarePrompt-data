Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all digit characters from `password`. Additionally, either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order.**
