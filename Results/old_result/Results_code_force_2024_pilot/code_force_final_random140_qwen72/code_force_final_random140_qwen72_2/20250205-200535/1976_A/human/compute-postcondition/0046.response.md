Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character of `password`. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains an empty string and `digits` is a string containing `ch`. If `ch` is not a digit, `letters` remains an empty string and `digits` also remains an empty string.***
