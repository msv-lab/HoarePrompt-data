Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions. `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is an empty string, and `digits` is an empty string.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `digits = ''` reassigns the variable `digits` to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
