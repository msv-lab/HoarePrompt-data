Postcondition: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 2`), the result of `func_2(newArray)` is `False`, and `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0.**
