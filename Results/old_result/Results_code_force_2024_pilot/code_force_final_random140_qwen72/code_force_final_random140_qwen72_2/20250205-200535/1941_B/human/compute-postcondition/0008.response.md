Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` (at least 3), `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1.**

The code initializes the variable `highestIndex` to -1, which was previously undefined. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
