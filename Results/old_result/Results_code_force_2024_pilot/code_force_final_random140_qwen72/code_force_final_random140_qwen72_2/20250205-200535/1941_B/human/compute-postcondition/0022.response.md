Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`. `highestNumber` is the maximum value among the elements from index 1 to `length - 2` in `inputarray`, and `highestIndex` is the index of the first occurrence of this maximum value.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices from 1 to `length - 2` (inclusive).
- During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element (`inputarray[elementIndex]`) is greater than or equal to the current `highestNumber`.
- If it is, `highestNumber` is updated to the value of the current element, and `highestIndex` is updated to the current `elementIndex`.
- After the loop completes, `highestNumber` will hold the maximum value found in the sublist from index 1 to `length - 2`, and `highestIndex` will hold the index of the first occurrence of this maximum value.
- The variable `elementIndex` will be `length - 1` after the loop finishes, as it will have been incremented to the last index in the range.
- The other variables (`inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, and `length`) remain unchanged.
