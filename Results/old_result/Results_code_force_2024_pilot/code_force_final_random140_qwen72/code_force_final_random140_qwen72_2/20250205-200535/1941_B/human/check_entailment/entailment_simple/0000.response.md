Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using the specified operation. Let's break down the components and logic of the program to assess its correctness.

### Function Analysis

1. **`func_1(array, index)`**:
   - This function performs the operation of decrementing the elements at positions `index-1`, `index`, and `index+1` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.
   - It correctly implements the operation as described in the problem statement.

2. **`func_2(arrayForSuccess)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented.

3. **`func_3(inputarray)`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying the operation described in `func_1`.
   - It first checks if the array is already all zeros using `func_2`. If so, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns.
   - If not, it enters a loop that runs up to 100 times. In each iteration, it finds the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies the operation to that index using `func_1`.
   - After applying the operation, it checks again if the array is all zeros using `func_2`. If so, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns.
   - If the loop completes without making the array all zeros, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list.

### Main Program Logic

- The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
- It calls `func_3` to determine if the array can be made all zeros and stores the result in the `answers` list.
- Finally, it prints the results stored in the `answers` list.

### Issues and Considerations

1. **Loop Limitation**:
   - The loop in `func_3` is limited to 100 iterations. This might not be sufficient for all test cases, especially those with large arrays or complex configurations.
   - However, the problem constraints suggest that the maximum length of the array is \(2 \times 10^5\), and the maximum number of test cases is \(10^4\). Given these constraints, 100 iterations might be a reasonable heuristic, but it could fail for certain edge cases.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases where the array is already all zeros or where the array cannot be made all zeros within the 100 iterations.
   - The current implementation seems to handle these cases correctly by appending 'YES' or 'NO' appropriately.

### Conclusion

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be mostly correct. However, the limitation of 100 iterations might cause issues for some edge cases. Despite this, the core logic and functions are implemented correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
