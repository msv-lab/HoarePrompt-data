### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of an array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1:** This function performs the operation on the array at the specified index.
   - **func_2:** This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - **func_3:** This function attempts to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the operation to the highest element in the middle of the array.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **func_1** correctly implements the operation as described.
   - **func_2** correctly checks if all elements are zero.
   - **func_3** has a few issues:
     - It uses a fixed loop counter (`loop_counter` with a limit of 100), which may not be sufficient for all test cases. The number of operations required to make all elements zero can vary widely depending on the input.
     - It selects the highest element in the middle of the array, but this approach may not always lead to a solution. For example, if the highest element is not part of a sequence that can be reduced to zero, the algorithm might fail.
     - The condition `if highestNumber < 0:` is incorrect because the elements are non-negative (as per the problem statement).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the elements is divisible by 4 (since each operation reduces the total sum by 4).
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that the elements can be reduced to zero without creating negative values.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program is incorrect because it relies on a fixed number of iterations and an incorrect selection criterion for the operation.
