Output State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is now -1, `highestIndex` is the index of the previous `highestNumber` within the range from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, and the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`.**
