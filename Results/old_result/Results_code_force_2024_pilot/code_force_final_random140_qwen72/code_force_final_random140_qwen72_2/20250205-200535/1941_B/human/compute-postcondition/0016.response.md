Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` is the value of `inputarray[2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` now holds the value of `inputarray[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
