Output State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, and the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code `length = len(inputarray)` reassigns the value of `length` to the length of `inputarray`. Since `length` was already defined as the length of `inputarray`, this operation does not change the value of `length`.
- All other variables (`inputarray`, `elementIndex`, `highestNumber`, `highestIndex`, `newArray`, `loop_counter`, and the result of `func_2(newArray)`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
