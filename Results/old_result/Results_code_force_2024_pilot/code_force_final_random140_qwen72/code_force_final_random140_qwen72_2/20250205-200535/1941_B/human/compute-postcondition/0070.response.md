The only objects in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `elementIndex` relative to `length`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 1 and `length` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 2), and `length` must still be greater than 2 to ensure that `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is greater than 2, `elementIndex` is 2, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 2)`. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`.**
