Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program uses a fixed loop counter (`loop_counter`) with a limit of 100 iterations, which may not be sufficient for all input arrays. This could lead to incorrect results for cases where more than 100 operations are required to make all elements zero.

For example, consider the following input:
```
n = 5
array = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]
```

In this case, the program will terminate after 100 iterations without making all elements zero, leading to an incorrect "NO" result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
