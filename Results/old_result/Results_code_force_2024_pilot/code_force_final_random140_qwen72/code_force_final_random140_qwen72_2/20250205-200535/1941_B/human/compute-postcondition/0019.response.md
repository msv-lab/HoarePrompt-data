Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 3, `highestIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `highestIndex` to the value of `elementIndex`, which is 3. The values of `inputarray`, `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, `length`, and `elementIndex` remain unchanged. Since the code does not modify `highestNumber`, its value also remains unchanged.
