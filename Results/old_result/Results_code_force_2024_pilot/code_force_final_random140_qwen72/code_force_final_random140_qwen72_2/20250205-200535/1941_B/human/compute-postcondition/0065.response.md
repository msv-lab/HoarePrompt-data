To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, length - 1)` contains at least one value.
   - For `range(1, length - 1)` to contain at least one value, `length - 1` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `length` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - `elementIndex` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is 1.
   - `length` must be greater than 2 to ensure the loop executes at least once.

4. **Other States:**
   - The other states (`inputarray`, `highestNumber`, `highestIndex`, `newArray`, `loop_counter`, and the result of `func_2(newArray)`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is greater than 2, `elementIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, and the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`**.
