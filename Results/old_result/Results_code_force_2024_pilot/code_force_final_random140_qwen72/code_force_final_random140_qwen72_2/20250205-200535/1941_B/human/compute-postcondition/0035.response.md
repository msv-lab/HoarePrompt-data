The code snippet `highestNumber = -1` changes the value of `highestNumber` from its initial state (which was the maximum value among the elements from index 1 to `length - 2` in `inputarray`) to `-1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value among the elements from index 1 to `length - 2` in `inputarray`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**
