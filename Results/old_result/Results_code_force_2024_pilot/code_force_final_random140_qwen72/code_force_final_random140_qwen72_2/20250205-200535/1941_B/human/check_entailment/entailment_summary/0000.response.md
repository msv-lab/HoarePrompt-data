### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly implements the operation described in the problem. It modifies the array by decrementing the specified elements.
   - **func_2**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
   - **func_3**: This function attempts to solve the problem by repeatedly applying `func_1` to the highest element in the array (excluding the first and last elements) until either all elements become zero or a maximum of 100 iterations is reached. If all elements become zero, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

3. **Algorithm Evaluation**:
   - The approach in `func_3` is to always target the highest element in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and apply the operation. This is a reasonable strategy because it tries to reduce the largest elements first, which can help in making the entire array zero.
   - However, the loop limit of 100 iterations is arbitrary and may not be sufficient for all test cases, especially for larger arrays or arrays with large values. This could lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm should work for small arrays and simple cases, but the fixed iteration limit might fail for more complex or larger arrays.
   - The problem does not specify a maximum number of operations, so the algorithm should ideally continue until it either succeeds or determines that it is impossible to make all elements zero.

### Conclusion:
Given the arbitrary limit of 100 iterations in `func_3`, the program may not correctly handle all test cases, especially those with larger arrays or larger values. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
