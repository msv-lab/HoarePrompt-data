Output State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is greater than 2, `elementIndex` is 2, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`, `highestIndex` is set to 2, `highestNumber` and `newArray` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `highestIndex = elementIndex` sets the value of `highestIndex` to 2, which matches the current value of `elementIndex`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
