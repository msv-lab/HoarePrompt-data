Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while loop_counter != 100:
    length = len(inputarray)
    highestNumber = -1
    highestIndex = -1
    for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
        if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
            highestIndex = elementIndex
            highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
    if highestNumber < 0:
        answers.append('NO')
        return
    newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
    if func_2(newArray):
        answers.append('YES')
        return
    loop_counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value among the elements from index 1 to `length - 2` in `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the first occurrence of this maximum value, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by 1, and the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged. Additionally, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, and the result of `func_2(newArray)` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 1`), the result of `func_2(newArray)` is `False`, and `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
