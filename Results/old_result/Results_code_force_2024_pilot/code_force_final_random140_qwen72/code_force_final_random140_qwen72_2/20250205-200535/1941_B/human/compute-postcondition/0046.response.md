The only objects in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `elementIndex` being less than `length - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 2, and `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 3), and `length` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 3. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is updated to 3, and `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[3]`. Otherwise, `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.**
