Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is updated to 2, and `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[2]`. Otherwise, `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.***
