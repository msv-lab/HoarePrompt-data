### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decrementing `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, for some index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function performs the specified operation on the array. It decrements `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - **func_2**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
   - **func_3**: This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying the operation from `func_1` on the highest element (excluding the first and last elements). It uses a loop counter with a maximum of 100 iterations.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies a limitation in the program: the fixed loop counter of 100 iterations may not be sufficient for all input arrays. This can lead to incorrect "NO" results for cases where more than 100 operations are required to make all elements zero.

4. **Verification**:
   - **Test Case Analysis**:
     - Consider the input array `[1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`. Each operation reduces the middle element by 2 and the adjacent elements by 1. To make all elements zero, we need to perform the operation 500000000 times. However, the program will terminate after 100 iterations, leading to an incorrect "NO" result.
   - **General Case**:
     - The fixed loop counter of 100 iterations is a hard constraint that limits the program's ability to handle large input arrays or arrays requiring many operations. This constraint makes the program incorrect for certain valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because the fixed loop counter of 100 iterations is insufficient to handle all valid input cases, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
