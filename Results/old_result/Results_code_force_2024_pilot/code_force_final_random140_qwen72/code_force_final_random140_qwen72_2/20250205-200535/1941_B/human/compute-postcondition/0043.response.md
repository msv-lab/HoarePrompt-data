The code snippet `highestIndex = elementIndex` updates the value of `highestIndex` to the value of `elementIndex`. Given that `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` is now 2. The other conditions and variables (`inputarray`, `length`, `highestNumber`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` is 2, `highestNumber` remains unchanged.**
