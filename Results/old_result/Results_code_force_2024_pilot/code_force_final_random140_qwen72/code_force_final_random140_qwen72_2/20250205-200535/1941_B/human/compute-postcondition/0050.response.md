Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 2` (since the loop iterates up to `length - 2`), `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, and `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this range. The variables `loop_counter`, `newArray`, and the result of `func_2(newArray)` remain unchanged.**
