The only variable in the loop head is `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `loop_counter` is 1, which means the condition `loop_counter != 100` is already satisfied.

Since the condition for the loop to execute is already met (`loop_counter` is 1, which is not equal to 100), no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1**
