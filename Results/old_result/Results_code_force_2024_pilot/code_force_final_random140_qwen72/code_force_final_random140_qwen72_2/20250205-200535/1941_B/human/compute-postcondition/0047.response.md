Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 3, `highestIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates `highestIndex` to the value of `elementIndex`, which is 3.
- The value of `highestNumber` remains unchanged because the code snippet only updates `highestIndex`.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain valid.
