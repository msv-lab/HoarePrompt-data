The only variable in the loop head is `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `loop_counter` was increased by 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `loop_counter` must still not be equal to 100.

State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of `highestNumber` within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, and the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`.**
