Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value among the elements from index 1 to `length - 2` in `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the first occurrence of this maximum value, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `length = len(inputarray)` reassigns the variable `length` to the length of `inputarray`. Since `length` was already defined as the length of `inputarray` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
