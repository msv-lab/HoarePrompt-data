Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is set by the loop starting from 1, `highestIndex` is now equal to `elementIndex`, and `highestNumber` is now equal to `inputarray[elementIndex]`.** 

The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
