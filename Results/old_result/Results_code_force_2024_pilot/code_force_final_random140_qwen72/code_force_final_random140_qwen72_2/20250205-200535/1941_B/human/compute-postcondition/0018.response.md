The only objects in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `elementIndex` being less than `length - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 2, and `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 3), and `length` must still be greater than `elementIndex + 1` (which means `length` must be greater than 3).

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 3. If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to -1, `highestNumber` is set to the value of `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` is updated to the value of `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.**
