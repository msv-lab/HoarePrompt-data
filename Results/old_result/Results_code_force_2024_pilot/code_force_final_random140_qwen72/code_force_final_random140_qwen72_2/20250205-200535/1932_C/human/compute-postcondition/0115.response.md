Postcondition: ***`l` is 1 if the next character in `s` is 'L' and the subsequent character is not 'L', otherwise `l` is 3 if the next character in `s` is 'L'. If the next character in `s` is not 'L', `l` is 0 if the subsequent character is not 'L', otherwise `l` is 2. `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the next character in `s`, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input. If the next character in `s` is not 'L', `r` is decreased by 1.***
