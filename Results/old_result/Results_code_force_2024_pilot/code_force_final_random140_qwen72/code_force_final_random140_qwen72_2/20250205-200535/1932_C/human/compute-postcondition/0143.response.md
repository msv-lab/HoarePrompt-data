To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans[::-1])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State:
- `l`: The total number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus the number of 'L' characters processed.
- `r`: `n - 1 - (number of 'R' characters in `s`)` plus the number of 'R' characters processed.
- `p`: The final product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions of 'R' and 'L' characters in `s` (from the end to the beginning), modulo `m`.
- `ans`: A list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.
- `arr`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

### Explanation:
1. **`ans` List**: This list contains the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop. Each value in `ans` is the product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions of 'R' and 'L' characters in `s`, taken from the end to the beginning, modulo `m`.

2. **Reversing `ans`**: The `[::-1]` slice reverses the list `ans`. This means the elements of `ans` will be printed in reverse order.

3. **Unpacking with `*`**: The `*` operator unpacks the list, so the elements of the reversed `ans` list will be printed as separate arguments to the `print` function.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Output: **[reversed elements of ans]**

For example, if `ans` is `[10, 20, 30]`, the output will be:
Output: **30 20 10**

If `ans` is `[5, 15, 25, 35]`, the output will be:
Output: **35 25 15 5**

In general, the output will be:
Output: **[reversed elements of ans]**
