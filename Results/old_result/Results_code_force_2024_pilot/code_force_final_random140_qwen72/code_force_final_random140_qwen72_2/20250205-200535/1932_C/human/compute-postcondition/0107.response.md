Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is 'L' or not. `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, and `k` is the first character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.***
