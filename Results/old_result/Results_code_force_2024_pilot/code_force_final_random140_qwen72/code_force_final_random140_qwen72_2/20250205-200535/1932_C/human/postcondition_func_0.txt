The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, a list of integers `a` of length `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only 'L' and 'R' characters. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the characters in `s` and the elements in `a`, applying modular arithmetic with `m`. The function prints the calculated sequence for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed sequences for all test cases, while the original inputs (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
