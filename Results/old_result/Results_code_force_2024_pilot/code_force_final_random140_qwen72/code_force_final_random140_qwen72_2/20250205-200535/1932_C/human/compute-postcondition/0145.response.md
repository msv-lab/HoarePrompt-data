Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints that there are multiple test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of integers `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not specified in the given information.**
