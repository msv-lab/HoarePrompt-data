To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

- The loop head is `for k in s:`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration includes:
  - `l` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether the next character in `s` is 'L' or not.
  - `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
  - `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`.
  - `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input.
  - `k` is the next character in `s`.
  - If `k` is 'L', `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`.
  - `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` (which is now `k`) must be considered. Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, the next iteration will use the next character in `s`.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string and the loop has already executed once, `s` must still have characters left for the loop to continue. Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:

- `k` should be the next character in `s`.
- `l` should be updated based on the new value of `k`:
  - If the next character `k` is 'L', `l` should be 2.
  - Otherwise, `l` should be 0.
- The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, `s`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly affected by the loop iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`l` is 0 if the next character in `s` is not 'L', otherwise `l` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the next character in `s`, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.**
