Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in s:
            if k == 'L':
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        
        p = 1
        
        ans = []
        
        for strr in s[::-1]:
            if strr == 'R':
                r += 1
                p = p * arr[r] % m
            else:
                l -= 1
                p = p * arr[l] % m
            ans.append(p)
        
        print(*ans[::-1])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. The values of `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the number of 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, respectively. Specifically, `l` is the total number of 'L' characters in `s` minus the number of 'L' characters processed, and `r` is `n - 1 - (number of 'R' characters in `s)` plus the number of 'R' characters processed. The values of `arr`, `s`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, a list of integers `a` of length `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only 'L' and 'R' characters. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the characters in `s` and the elements in `a`, applying modular arithmetic with `m`. The function prints the calculated sequence for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed sequences for all test cases, while the original inputs (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
