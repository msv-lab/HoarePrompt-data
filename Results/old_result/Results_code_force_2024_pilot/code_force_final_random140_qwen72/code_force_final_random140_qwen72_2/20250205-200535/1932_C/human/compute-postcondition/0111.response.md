Postcondition: ***`l` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether the next character in `s` is 'L' or not. `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the next character in `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.***
