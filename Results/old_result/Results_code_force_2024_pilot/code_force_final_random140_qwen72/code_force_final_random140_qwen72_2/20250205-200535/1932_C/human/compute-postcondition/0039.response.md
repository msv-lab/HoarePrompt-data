The only object in the loop head is the variable `strr` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over the characters of `s` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `strr` was the second-to-last character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `strr` needs to be the last character of `s`. Since the loop is iterating over `s` in reverse, the next character to be processed is the last character of `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `strr` is now the last character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `ans` now contains the value of `p` appended to its previous contents. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.**
