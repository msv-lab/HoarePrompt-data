Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s` when the loop starts. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is updated to `n - 1 - (number of 'R' characters in `s) + 1`, and `p` is set to `arr[r] % m`. If `strr` is not 'R', `l` is updated to the total number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus 1, and `p` is set to `arr[l] % m`. `ans` now contains the value of `p`. `arr`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
