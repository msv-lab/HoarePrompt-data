Postcondition: ***`ans` is an empty list, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - (number of 'R' characters in `s` + number of 'L' characters in `s`), `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the last character processed from `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain as provided by the user input. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is incremented by 1, `k` is set to 'R', and `p` is updated to `(1 * arr[r]) % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, `k` remains the last character processed from `s`, and `p` is updated to `arr[l] % m`.***
