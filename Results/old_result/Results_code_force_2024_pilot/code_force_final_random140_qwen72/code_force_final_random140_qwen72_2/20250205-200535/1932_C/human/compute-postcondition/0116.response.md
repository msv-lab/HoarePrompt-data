Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `l` is the total number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, and `r` is `n - 1 - (number of 'R' characters in `s`). The values of `arr`, `ans`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `l` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each 'L' character encountered in the string `s`.
- `r` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 for each 'R' character encountered in the string `s`.
- The loop iterates through each character in the string `s`, so after all iterations, `l` will be the total count of 'L' characters, and `r` will be adjusted based on the number of 'R' characters.
- The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m`) are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
