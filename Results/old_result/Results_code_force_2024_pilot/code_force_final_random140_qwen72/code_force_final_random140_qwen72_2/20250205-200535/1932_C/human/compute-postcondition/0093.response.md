Output State: **`ans` is a list containing three elements, where the third element is the updated value of `p`. The values of `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `strr` is the next character in the reversed string `s`. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `(p * arr[r]) % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.**
