Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `ans` now contains the value of `p` appended to its previous contents. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.**
