Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it processes the commands and calculates the product. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the product `p` is updated and the indices `l` and `r` are adjusted. The program incorrectly updates the product and indices in the reverse order of the commands, which leads to incorrect results.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        p = 1
        for i in range(n):
            p = (p * arr[i]) % m
        ans = []
        for k in s:
            ans.append(p)
            if k == 'L':
                p = (p * pow(arr[l], m-2, m)) % m
                l += 1
            else:
                p = (p * pow(arr[r], m-2, m)) % m
                r -= 1
        print(*ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized to 1.
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n-1` respectively, representing the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array.

2. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - Calculate the product of all elements in the array modulo `m`.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - For each command in the string `s`, append the current product `p` to the result list `ans`.
   - If the command is 'L', update the product by dividing it by the leftmost element (using modular inverse) and increment `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', update the product by dividing it by the rightmost element (using modular inverse) and decrement `r`.

4. **Modular Inverse**:
   - The modular inverse of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` is calculated using `pow(arr[l], m-2, m)` or `pow(arr[r], m-2, m)` respectively, which works because `m` is a prime number (Fermat's Little Theorem).

This corrected program ensures that the product is correctly updated and the indices are adjusted according to the commands, producing the correct output for each test case.
