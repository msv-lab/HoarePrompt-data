Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input, `l` is 0.** 

The variable `l` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
