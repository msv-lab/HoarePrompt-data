Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the sequence of operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the program processes the commands and updates the product. The program incorrectly reverses the order of processing the commands and does not correctly update the product as elements are removed from the array.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1 4 2 0
```

The program incorrectly processes the commands in reverse order and updates the product accordingly, leading to incorrect results. The correct approach would be to process the commands in the given order and update the product as elements are removed from the array.
