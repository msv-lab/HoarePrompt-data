Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1 and `p` is set to `arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1 and `p` is set to `arr[l] % m`. `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `ans` now contains the value of `p`.**
