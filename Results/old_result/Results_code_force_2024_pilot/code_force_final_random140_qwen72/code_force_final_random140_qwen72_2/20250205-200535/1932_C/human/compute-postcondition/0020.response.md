Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `l` will be the number of 'L' characters in `s`, and `r` will be `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each 'L' character, `l` is incremented by 1. For each 'R' character, `r` is decremented by 1. Therefore, after the loop completes, `l` will hold the total count of 'L' characters in `s`, and `r` will be `n - 1` minus the total count of 'R' characters in `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr`) are not modified by the loop and thus retain their initial values.
