Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. The values of `r`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `s` is now a string provided by the user input. The loop will execute again if the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` has not been reached. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input. `r` is now `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for k in s:
    if k == 'L':
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is 'L' or not. `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, and `k` is the first character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`l` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether the next character in `s` is 'L' or not. `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the next character in `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`l` is 1 if the next character in `s` is 'L' and the subsequent character is not 'L', otherwise `l` is 3 if the next character in `s` is 'L'. If the next character in `s` is not 'L', `l` is 0 if the subsequent character is not 'L', otherwise `l` is 2. `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the next character in `s`, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input. If the next character in `s` is not 'L', `r` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
