You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. The values of `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the number of 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, respectively. Specifically, `l` is the total number of 'L' characters in `s` minus the number of 'L' characters processed, and `r` is `n - 1 - (number of 'R' characters in `s)` plus the number of 'R' characters processed. The values of `arr`, `s`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the current left and right boundaries of the array. Initially, `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `n-1`.

3. **First Pass (Command Processing)**: The program iterates through the command string `s` to adjust the pointers `l` and `r` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This step is crucial for determining which elements will be removed in the subsequent steps.

4. **Second Pass (Product Calculation)**: The program then iterates through the command string `s` in reverse order. For each command:
   - If the command is 'R', it increments the right pointer `r` and multiplies the current product `p` by the element at the new right boundary.
   - If the command is 'L', it decrements the left pointer `l` and multiplies the current product `p` by the element at the new left boundary.
   - The product `p` is taken modulo `m` to ensure it stays within the required range.
   - The result is appended to the answer list `ans`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results in the correct order by reversing the `ans` list and printing its elements.

### Analysis of Potential Issues:

- **Order of Operations**: The program correctly processes the commands in the order they are given and calculates the product modulo `m` at each step.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the boundaries of the array correctly by adjusting the pointers `l` and `r` appropriately.
- **Modulo Operation**: The product is taken modulo `m` at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the commands in the correct order, updates the array boundaries, and calculates the required products modulo `m`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
