Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list containing one element which is the updated value of `p`. If `strr` is 'R', `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`, and `r` is incremented by 1 if the previous `strr` was 'R'. If `strr` is not 'R', `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`, and `l` is decremented by 2 if the previous `strr` was not 'R'. In both cases, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` (decremented by 1 if the previous `strr` was not 'R'), `r` is `n - (number of 'R' characters in `s` + number of 'L' characters in `s`)` (incremented by 1 if the previous `strr` was 'R'), `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the last character processed from `s` (set to 'R' if the previous `strr` was 'R'), and `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain as provided by the user input. `strr` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.***
