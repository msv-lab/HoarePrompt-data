### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the current left and right boundaries of the array. Initially, `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `n-1`.

3. **First Pass (Command Processing)**: The program iterates through the command string `s` to adjust the pointers `l` and `r` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This step is crucial for determining which elements will be removed in the subsequent steps.

4. **Second Pass (Product Calculation)**: The program then iterates through the command string `s` in reverse order. For each command:
   - If the command is 'R', it increments the right pointer `r` and multiplies the current product `p` by the element at the new right boundary.
   - If the command is 'L', it decrements the left pointer `l` and multiplies the current product `p` by the element at the new left boundary.
   - The product `p` is taken modulo `m` to ensure it stays within the required range.
   - The result is appended to the answer list `ans`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results in the correct order by reversing the `ans` list and printing its elements.

### Analysis of Potential Issues:

- **Order of Operations**: The program correctly processes the commands in the order they are given and calculates the product modulo `m` at each step.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the boundaries of the array correctly by adjusting the pointers `l` and `r` appropriately.
- **Modulo Operation**: The product is taken modulo `m` at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the commands in the correct order, updates the array boundaries, and calculates the required products modulo `m`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
