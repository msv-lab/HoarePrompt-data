The code snippet `p = p * arr[r] % m` modifies the value of `p` by multiplying it with the element at index `r` in the array `arr` and then taking the modulus of the result with `m`. Given that `r` is increased by 1 before this operation, the new value of `p` is calculated using the updated value of `r`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`, `arr`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, `r` is increased by 1, `p` is now equal to the previous value of `p` multiplied by `arr[r]` modulo `m`.**
