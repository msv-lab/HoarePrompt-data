To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `command` is updated to the list of strings read from standard input.
   - `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple containing the values `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Variables Involved in the Print Statement:**
   - `time`: This is explicitly given as 1.
   - `player`: This depends on the result of `isPlayer(obj)`.
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement uses the format `'%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player)`.
   - `time` is always 1.
   - `player` will be either `obj` (if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`) or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` (if `isPlayer(obj)` is `False`).

Given this information, the output will depend on the value of `player`. Since we don't have the exact values of `obj`, `mov`, `com`, and `grid`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **1 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`)**
