Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0) and the key `line[2]` mapped to the tuple (0, 2). If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..': `elements` also has the key `line[1]` mapped to the tuple (0, 1). `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least three elements, `ind` is 2. `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[0]` mapped to `False` if `isPlayer(line[0])` returns `True`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` also contains the key `line[1]` mapped to `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. If `line[2][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0 and `goal[0]` contains the tuple (0, 2). Otherwise, `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 2).**

Explanation:
- The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`.
- Given `i` is 0 and `ind` is 2, the tuple `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.
- The value of `tmp` depends on the first character of `line[2]`. If `line[2][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, so the tuple `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[0]`.
- If `line[2][0]` is not 'B', `tmp` is 1, so the tuple `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[1]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
