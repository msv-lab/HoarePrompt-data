Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is undefined. `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `com == 'T'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `points`. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
