Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`. If `line[1]` is not '..', `allPlayers[line[1]]` is set to `False` if `line[1]` is a player character, `elements` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `(n - 1, 1)`, and if `line[1]` is 'G', the tuple `(n - 1, 1)` is appended to the sublist in `goal` indexed by `tmp`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[1]` is '..', none of these changes occur.***
