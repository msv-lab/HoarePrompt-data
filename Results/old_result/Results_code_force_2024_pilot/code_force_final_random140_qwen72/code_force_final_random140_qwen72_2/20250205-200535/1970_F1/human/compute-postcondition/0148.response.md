Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is incremented by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `team` is determined based on the value of `obj[0]`:
     - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName` is assumed to be a list where `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are strings representing the names of the goals for team 0 and team 1, respectively.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The format string `'%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH'` will be filled with the values of `time` and `GoalName[team]`.
   - Since `time` is 1, the first part of the output will be `1`.
   - The second part of the output will be `GoalName[team]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1, and the output will be `1 GoalName[1] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`.
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0, and the output will be `1 GoalName[0] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`.

Since the exact values of `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **1 GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B', otherwise team is 0, and GoalName[team] is the corresponding goal name for the team)**
