Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0) and the key `line[0]` mapped to the tuple (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 0, the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..', and the function `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, indicating that the element at index `ind` in `line` represents a player.**
