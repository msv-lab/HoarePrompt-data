To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `command` is updated to a list of strings read from standard input.
   - `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple containing the values `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)` being called.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Variable Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`. Since the exact implementation of `goalIn(pos)` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `team`. However, we know that `team` will be an index into the `GoalName` list.
   - `GoalName[team]` will be the string corresponding to the index `team` in the `GoalName` list. Again, without knowing the contents of `GoalName`, we can only say that it will be one of the strings in the `GoalName` list.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print` statement will format the output as `'%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team])`.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `GoalName[team]` will be the string at the index `team` in the `GoalName` list.

Given this analysis, the output will be:
Output: **1 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [GoalName[team]] is the string at the index `team` in the `GoalName` list)**
