Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, and `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `len(command) > 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is the fourth element of `command`. If `el == '.Q'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el == '.S'`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) < 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is undefined. `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `obj == '.B' and (isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt))`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj == '.B' and com == 'T'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `obj == '.B' and goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `obj == '.B' and com is not 'T' and isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not '.B', the state remains unchanged.***
