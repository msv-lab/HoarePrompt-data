Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0) and the key `line[1]` mapped to the tuple (0, 1), `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `ind` is 1, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[0]` mapped to `False` if `isPlayer(line[0])` returns `True`, otherwise `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 0) if `line[0][1]` is 'G', otherwise `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.** 

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `tmp` based on the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'`.
- If `line[1][0]` (since `ind` is 1) is 'B', `tmp` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, `tmp` is set to 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
