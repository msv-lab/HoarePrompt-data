Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `ind` is `len(line)`, `elements` now includes a key for the last element in `line` with the value `(i, ind)` where `i` is `n - 1` and `ind` is `len(line)`, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the last element in `line` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it.**
