Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, if `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, `el` is undefined, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `pos` and `nxt` are used in the calculation, and `elements[obj]` now holds the value of `nxt`.
