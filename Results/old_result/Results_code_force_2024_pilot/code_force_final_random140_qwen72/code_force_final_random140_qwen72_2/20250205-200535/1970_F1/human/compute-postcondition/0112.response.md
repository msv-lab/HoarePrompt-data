The code snippet assigns the value 1 to `team` if the first character of `obj` (which is the first element of `command`) is 'B', otherwise, it assigns 0 to `team`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input with a length of 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command` and is equal to '.S', `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else `team` is 0.**
