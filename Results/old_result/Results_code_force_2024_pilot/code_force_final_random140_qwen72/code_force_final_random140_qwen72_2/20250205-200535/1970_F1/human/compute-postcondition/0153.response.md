Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 1, `command` is updated to the list of strings read from standard input, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the values `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.** 

The value of `nxt` is calculated by adding the corresponding elements of `pos` and `mov[com]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
