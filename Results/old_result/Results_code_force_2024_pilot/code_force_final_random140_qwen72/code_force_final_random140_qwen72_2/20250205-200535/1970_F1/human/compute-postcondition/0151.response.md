The code attempts to unpack the `command` list into two variables `obj` and `com`. However, the variable name used to access the list is misspelled as `comand` instead of `command`. This will result in a NameError because `comand` is not defined.

Since the code results in an error, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 1, `command` is updated to the list of strings read from standard input.**
