Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 1, and `command` is updated to the list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', then `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the values `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj == '.B'`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or `(isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt)`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` does not return -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.***
