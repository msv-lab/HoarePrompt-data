Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3. A `NameError` is raised due to undefined variables `elements` or `obj`. `nxt` is not defined because `pos`, `mov`, and `com` are not defined. Additionally, either `obj` is not equal to `.B` or `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, and either `isPlayer(obj)` is false or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. The current value of `com` is 'T'. `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. The function `goalIn(pos)` returns a value that is not -1. `team` is set to the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`. `points[team]` is increased by 1.**
