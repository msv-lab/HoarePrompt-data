Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), and now includes the key `line[ind]` with the value `(i, ind)`, `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is now a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters, `ind` is 0, and the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player character (not '..').**
