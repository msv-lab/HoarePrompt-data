The code snippet updates the `allPlayers` dictionary by adding a new entry with the key `line[ind]` and the value `False`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `ind` is 1, so `line[ind]` refers to `line[1]`.
- The `allPlayers` dictionary will now include the key `line[1]` with the value `False`.

All other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0) and the key `line[1]` mapped to the tuple (0, 1), `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `ind` is 1, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[0]` mapped to `False` if `isPlayer(line[0])` returns `True`, and the key `line[1]` mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 0) if `line[0][1]` is 'G', otherwise `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists, `tmp` is 1 if `line[0][1]` is 'G', otherwise `tmp` is not defined.**
