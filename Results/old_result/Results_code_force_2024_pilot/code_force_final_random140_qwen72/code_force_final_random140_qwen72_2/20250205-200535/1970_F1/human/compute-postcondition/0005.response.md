Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is [0, 0].**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `points = [0, 0]` reassigns the `points` variable to a new list `[0, 0]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
