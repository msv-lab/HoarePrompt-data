Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is undefined. `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or `(isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt)`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com == 'T'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `elements[obj] = nxt` updates the value of `elements[obj]` to `nxt`.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), which is derived from the initial state.
- The variable `elements[obj]` now holds the new position `nxt`.
- All other parts of the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
