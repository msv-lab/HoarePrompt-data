Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.
   - If `len(command) == 3`, then:
     - `obj` is the second element of `command`.
     - `com` is the third element of `command`.
   - `el` is undefined.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`. Since `pos` is derived from `elements[obj]`, and `obj` is the second element of `command`, the value of `team` depends on the specific position in the game.
   - `GoalName` is a dictionary or list that maps `team` to a string. The exact value of `GoalName[team]` depends on the value of `team`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will format the output as `'%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team])`.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `GoalName[team]` will be the string corresponding to the value of `team` in the `GoalName` mapping.

Since the exact value of `team` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **2 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [GoalName[team]] is the string corresponding to the value of `team` in the `GoalName` mapping)**
