To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.
   - If `len(command) == 3`, then:
     - `obj` is the second element of `command`.
     - `com` is the third element of `command`.
   - `el` is undefined.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).
   - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `player` is determined based on the conditions:
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, `player` is `obj`.
     - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

4. **Determining `player`:**
   - `obj` is the second element of `command`.
   - `com` is the third element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).
   - `player` is either `obj` or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` depending on the result of `isPlayer(obj)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the current value of `time` (which is 2) followed by the value of `player` and the string "ELIMINATED".
   - Since the exact values of `obj`, `com`, `mov`, `elements`, and `grid` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is either the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, or the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` otherwise)**
