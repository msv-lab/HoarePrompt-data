You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. grid is a list of n lists, each containing m pairs of characters representing the field. elements is a dictionary mapping pairs of characters to their positions (i, ind) on the grid. allPlayers is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are currently carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of two lists, each containing tuples of positions (i, ind) of the goals for the respective team. points is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {'.B': (0, 0)}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]
    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        
        grid.append(line)

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of strings read from the input. `elements` is a dictionary that includes keys for each non-'..' element found in any of the lines, with their corresponding indices as tuples (row, column). `points` remains [0, 0]. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in any of the lines, each mapped to `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters found in any of the lines, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters. `ind` is the last index processed in the final iteration, which is `m - 1`.
    t = int(stdin.readline().strip())

                player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
                print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
            elif com == 'T':

                    team = goalIn(pos)
                    print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                    points[team] += 1

                elements[obj] = nxt
            if obj == '.B':
                elements[obj] = nxt
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `time` is `t - 1`, `command` is the last list of strings read from standard input during the final iteration. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el == '.Q'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el == '.S'`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `obj == '.B' and (isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt))`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj == '.B' and com == 'T'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `obj == '.B' and goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `obj == '.B' and com is not 'T' and isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `points`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `ind`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final scores of the two teams after all iterations and conditions have been applied)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a tuple containing the updated grid, elements, allPlayers, goal, and points after processing the game logic for a Quidditch match, where the grid represents the playing field, elements map character pairs to their positions on the grid, allPlayers tracks which players are carrying the Quaffle, goal contains the positions of the goals for both teams, and points holds the current scores of the red and blue teams.
