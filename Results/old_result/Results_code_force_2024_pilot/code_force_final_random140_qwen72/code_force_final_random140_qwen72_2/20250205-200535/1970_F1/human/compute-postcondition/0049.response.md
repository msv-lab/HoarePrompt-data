Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), and now includes the key `line[ind]` with the value `(i, ind)`, `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is now a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters, `ind` is 0, the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..' and is not a player character, and the second character of the element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`.
- Since `tmp` is 1, the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to the second sublist of `goal`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
