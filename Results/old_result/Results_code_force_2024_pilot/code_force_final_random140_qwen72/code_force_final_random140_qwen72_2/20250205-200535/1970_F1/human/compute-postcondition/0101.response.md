Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is a list of strings read from the input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`. For each element in `line` that is not '..', `elements` includes the key for that element with the value `(n - 1, index)`. For each player character in `line`, `allPlayers` includes the key for that character with the value `False`. For each element in `line` that is not a player character and ends with 'G', the tuple `(n - 1, index)` is appended to the appropriate sublist in `goal` based on whether the element starts with 'B' or 'R'.**
