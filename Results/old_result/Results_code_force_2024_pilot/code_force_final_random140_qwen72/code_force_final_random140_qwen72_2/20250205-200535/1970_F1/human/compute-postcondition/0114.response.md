Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input with a length of 3.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command` and is equal to `.S`.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Determine the values of the variables:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings with three elements.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command` and is equal to `.S`.
   - `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`:
     - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10, but since we are only concerned with the print statement, we don't need to know the exact value of `points[team]`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))`
   - `time` is 0.
   - `GoalName[team]` depends on the value of `team`:
     - If `team` is 1, `GoalName[1]` is used.
     - If `team` is 0, `GoalName[0]` is used.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since `team` is determined by `obj[0]`:
     - If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is 1, and the output will be: `0 GoalName[1] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`.
     - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', `team` is 0, and the output will be: `0 GoalName[0] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`.

However, without knowing the exact values of `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **0 GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where team is 1 if obj[0] is 'B' else team is 0)**
