The code snippet `e, f = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `e` and `f`.

- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `steps` remains 1.
- `a` and `b` remain as their original input integers.
- `c` and `d` remain as their updated input integers.
- `g` and `h` remain as their original input integers.
- `n` remains `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`.
- `x` remains `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
- The condition that if `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`, otherwise `x` is less than or equal to `n`, still holds true.

However, `e` and `f` are now updated to the new input integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are updated to new input integers, `e` and `f` are new input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
