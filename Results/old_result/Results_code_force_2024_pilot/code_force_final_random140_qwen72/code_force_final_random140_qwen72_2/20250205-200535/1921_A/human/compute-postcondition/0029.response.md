Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `c` and `d` are updated to new input integers, `e` and `f` are new input integers, `g` and `h` are new input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. After the if-else block, if `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
- The conditions for `x` being greater than or less than or equal to `n` remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
