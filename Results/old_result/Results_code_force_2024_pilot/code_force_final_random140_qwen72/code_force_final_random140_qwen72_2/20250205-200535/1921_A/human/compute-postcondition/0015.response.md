The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.

- The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are input integers, which means they are being updated by this code snippet.
- The values of `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is calculated based on the previous values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, so it remains the same.
- The value of `x` is calculated based on the previous values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f`, so it also remains the same.
- The condition about whether `x` is greater than `n` or not remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 1, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
