To determine what will be printed by the `print(n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `steps` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` and `d` are updated to new input integers.
- `e` and `f` are new input integers.
- `g` and `h` are new input integers.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).

### Calculation of `n`:
- `n` is the Euclidean distance squared between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\). This is calculated as:
  \[
  n = (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2
  \]

### Calculation of `x`:
- `x` is the Euclidean distance squared between the points \((a, b)\) and \((e, f)\). This is calculated as:
  \[
  x = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2
  \]

### Condition:
- If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`.
- Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Print Statement:
- The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
- The value of `n` is \((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2\), which is the Euclidean distance squared between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).

Output: **(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 (where a, b, c, and d are the input integers)**
