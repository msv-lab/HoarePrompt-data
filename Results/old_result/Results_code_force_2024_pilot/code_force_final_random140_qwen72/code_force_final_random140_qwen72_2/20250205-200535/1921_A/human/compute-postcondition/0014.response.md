The only variable in the loop head is `steps`, and the loop's continuation depends on the value of `steps` being less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `steps` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `steps` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
