Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the area of a square given its corner coordinates. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the side length of the square can be determined by the distance between any two adjacent corners. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners will be either the difference in the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates.

However, the program's approach to calculating the area is flawed. Specifically, it calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances. This approach is incorrect because:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Side Length**: The side length of the square should be the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners. The program instead calculates the Euclidean distance squared between two points, which is not necessarily the side length of the square.

2. **Assumption of Adjacency**: The program assumes that the points `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` are adjacent, and similarly for `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`. This assumption is not always true, as the points are given in random order.

3. **Ignoring Other Points**: The program does not consider the other two points `(g, h)` in its calculations, which might be necessary to correctly identify the side length of the square.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the four points.
2. Calculate the side length of the square as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).
3. Compute the area as the square of the side length.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
