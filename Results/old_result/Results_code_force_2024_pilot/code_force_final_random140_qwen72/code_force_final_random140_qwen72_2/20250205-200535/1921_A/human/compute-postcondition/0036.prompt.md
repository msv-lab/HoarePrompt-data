You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives no direct parameters but operates under the assumption that the input is provided in a specific format. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. Each test case is described by four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It is guaranteed that the points form a valid square with a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is `t-1`, `a` and `b` are the last set of input integers, `c` and `d` are the last set of input integers, `e` and `f` are the last set of input integers, `g` and `h` are the last set of input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. After the if-else block, if `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each representing a square defined by its corner coordinates. It returns the area of each square for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
