Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers.** 

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `d`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new variables `c` and `d` now hold the values of the input integers.
