Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program attempts to calculate the area of the square by computing the squared distance between two points and then selecting the smaller of two such distances. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square in all cases. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is 4 (side length is 2). However, the program will compute the distances between the points (0, 0) and (0, 2), and (0, 0) and (2, 0), which are both 4. It will then print 4, but the actual area should be 4, not 4 (since the side length is 2, the area is \(2^2 = 4\)).

The program fails to correctly identify the side length of the square in all cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
