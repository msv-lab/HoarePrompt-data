The code snippet `e, f = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `e` and `f`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive
- `steps` is 0
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `c` and `d` are input integers

After executing the code snippet, the variables `e` and `f` are assigned the values from the input. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers.**
