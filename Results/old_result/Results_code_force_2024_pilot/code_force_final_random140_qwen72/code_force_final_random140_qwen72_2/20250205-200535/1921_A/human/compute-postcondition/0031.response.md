To determine what will be printed by the `print(n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
   - `steps` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are new input integers.
   - `c` and `d` are updated to new input integers.
   - `e` and `f` are new input integers.
   - `g` and `h` are new input integers.
   - `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).
   - `x` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).

2. **After the if-else block:**
   - If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`.
   - Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains `print(n)`, which will print the value of `n`.

Given the initial state, `n` is defined as:
\[ n = (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 \]

This formula calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the squared Euclidean distance between the points (a, b) and (c, d))**
