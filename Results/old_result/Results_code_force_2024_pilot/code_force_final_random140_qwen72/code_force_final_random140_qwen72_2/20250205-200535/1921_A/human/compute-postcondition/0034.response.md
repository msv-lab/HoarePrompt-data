Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is `t-1`, `a` and `b` are the last set of input integers, `c` and `d` are the last set of input integers, `e` and `f` are the last set of input integers, `g` and `h` are the last set of input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. After the if-else block, if `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` remains greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains unchanged as it was initially defined.
- **`steps`**: After all iterations, `steps` will be `t-1` because the loop starts from 0 and runs up to `t-1`.
- **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`**: These variables will hold the values of the last set of inputs provided during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`n` and `x`**: These are calculated based on the last set of inputs, and the if-else block will determine which value is printed based on the comparison between `n` and `x`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
