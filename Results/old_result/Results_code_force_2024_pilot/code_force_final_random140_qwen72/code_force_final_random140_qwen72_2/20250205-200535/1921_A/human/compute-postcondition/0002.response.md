The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and `steps` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input, while the values of `t` and `steps` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
