The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads input from the user, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. This function does not execute any immediate changes to the variables in the initial state. It only prepares a function that can be used later to read and process input.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5; l and r are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. R is a function that reads input and returns a map object of integers.**
