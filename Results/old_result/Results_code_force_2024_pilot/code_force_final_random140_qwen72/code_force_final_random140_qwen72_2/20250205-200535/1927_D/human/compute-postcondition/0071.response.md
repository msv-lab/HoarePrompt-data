To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is the length of the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration.
- `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element.
- `t` is 0.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `q` is the first (and only) element from the iterable returned by `R()` minus 3 and must be truthy.

### Analysis:
1. **Iterable `R()`**: Let's assume `R()` returns an iterable with elements `[x1, x2, x3, ..., xn]`.
   - `l` is the first element: `l = x1`.
   - `r` is the second element: `r = x2`.
   - `p` is the last element: `p = xn`.
   - `i` is the length of the iterable: `i = n`.

2. **List `a`**: This list contains the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration. Since `j` takes values from the iterable, `a` will contain the elements of the iterable in the order they were iterated over.

3. **Variable `j`**: 
   - If the last element `xn` is different from the second-to-last element `xn-1`, then `j` is the second-to-last value of `i`.
   - Otherwise, `j` is the last value of `i`.

4. **Variable `q`**: 
   - `q` is the first element of the iterable minus 3: `q = x1 - 3`.
   - `q` must be truthy, meaning `x1 - 3` must be non-zero and non-false.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

- **Condition `a[r] < l`**:
  - `a[r]` is the value of `a` at index `r`.
  - `l` is the first element of the iterable.
  - If `a[r] < l`, the tuple `[-1, -1]` will be selected.
  - Otherwise, the tuple `(a[r], r)` will be selected.

- **Unpacking the Tuple**:
  - The `*` operator unpacks the selected tuple into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Final Output:
- If `a[r] < l`, the output will be `-1 -1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `a[r] r`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, let's assume the iterable `R()` returns `[5, 7, 9]`:
- `l = 5`
- `r = 7`
- `a = [5, 7, 9]`
- `a[r] = a[7]` (which is out of bounds, but assuming `a[r]` is the second element, `a[1] = 7`)

Since `a[r] = 7` and `l = 5`, `a[r] > l`.

Therefore, the tuple `(a[r], r)` will be selected and unpacked.

Output: **7 1** (assuming `r` is 1, the second element index)

However, if `a[r]` is indeed out of bounds, the behavior is undefined. Assuming the correct index, the output is:

Output: **7 1** (where `a[r]` is the second element of `a` and `r` is the second element of the iterable)
