Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it processes the array `a` and determines the indices `i` and `j` for each query. Specifically, the program uses a single pass to create an array `a` that stores the last index where a different element was found. However, this approach does not correctly handle all cases where a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the query range `[l, r]`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

For the query `(1, 5)`, the program should output a valid pair of indices where the elements are different, such as `(2, 3)` (since `a[2] = 1` and `a[3] = 2`). However, the program will output `(3, 5)` because it incorrectly assumes that the last index where a different element was found is always valid.

For the query `(1, 2)`, the program correctly outputs `(-1, -1)` because there are no different elements in the range `[1, 2]`.

For the query `(1, 3)`, the program should output a valid pair of indices where the elements are different, such as `(1, 3)` (since `a[1] = 1` and `a[3] = 2`). However, the program will output `(3, 3)` which is incorrect because `i` and `j` must be different.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for some queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
