Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `R()` must return an iterable with at least one element, `j` is updated to `i` if `x != p` (now `p` is equal to `x`), otherwise `j` remains unchanged, `a` is a tuple with the current value of `j` appended to it, `p` is now equal to `x`, `x` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is updated based on the condition `x != p`. If `x` is not equal to `p`, `j` is set to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.
- The values of `i`, `R()`, `a`, `p`, and `x` remain as described in the initial state, with `p` being updated to the current value of `x` and `x` being set to the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
