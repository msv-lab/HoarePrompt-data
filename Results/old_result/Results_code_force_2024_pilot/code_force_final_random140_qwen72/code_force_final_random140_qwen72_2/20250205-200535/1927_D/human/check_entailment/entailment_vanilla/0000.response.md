### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function `R` is defined to read and split input into integers.
   - The variable `t` is set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` is read but not used directly.
   - The array `a` is initialized with a dummy value `0` to handle 1-based indexing.

2. **Array Processing:**
   - The loop iterates over the input array elements.
   - `j` is updated to the current index `i` if the current element `x` is different from the previous element `p`.
   - The array `a` is extended with the value of `j` at each step.
   - `p` is updated to the current element `x`, and `i` is incremented.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The number of queries `q` is read.
   - For each query, the range `[l, r]` is read.
   - The function checks if `a[r]` (which is the last index where a different element was found) is less than `l`. If so, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no such pair exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic correctly identifies the last index `j` where a different element was found up to the current index `i`.
  - For each query, it checks if this last index `a[r]` is within the query range `[l, r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is less than `l`, it means there are no different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases where the array has all identical elements within the query range.
  - It also handles the case where the array has different elements and correctly identifies the indices.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The code processes the array in O(n) time and handles each query in O(1) time, making it efficient for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It efficiently processes the input and handles all edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
