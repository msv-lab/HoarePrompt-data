To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of the iterable `R()`, respectively.
- `i` is the length of the iterable `R()`.
- `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration.
- `p` is the last element of the iterable `R()`.
- `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element.
- `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged except that `q` is now the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 2 and must be a truthy value.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

1. **Evaluate `a[r] < l`:**
   - `a[r]` is the value at index `r` in the list `a`.
   - `l` is the first element of the iterable `R()`.
   - This condition checks if the value at index `r` in `a` is less than the first element of `R()`.

2. **Determine the Tuple to Unpack:**
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the tuple `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[True]` will be `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the tuple `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[False]` will be `(a[r], r)`.

3. **Unpack the Tuple:**
   - If the condition is `True`, the `print` statement will unpack `[-1, -1]` and print `-1 -1`.
   - If the condition is `False`, the `print` statement will unpack `(a[r], r)` and print `a[r] r`.

### Final Output:
- To determine the exact output, we need to know the specific values of `a[r]` and `l`.
- Since the exact values of `a` and `R()` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **-1 -1 (if a[r] < l) or a[r] r (if a[r] >= l)**

This means:
- If `a[r]` is less than `l`, the output will be `-1 -1`.
- If `a[r]` is greater than or equal to `l`, the output will be the values of `a[r]` and `r`.
