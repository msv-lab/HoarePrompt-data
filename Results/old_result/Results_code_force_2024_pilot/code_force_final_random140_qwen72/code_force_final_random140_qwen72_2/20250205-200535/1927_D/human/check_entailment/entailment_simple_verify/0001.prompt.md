You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0, `i` will be the length of the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` will be the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element, `q` will be 0, `n` will remain unchanged, and `l` and `r` will be the last values read from the queries.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function `R` is defined to read and split input into integers.
   - The variable `t` is set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` is read but not used directly.
   - The array `a` is initialized with a dummy value `0` to handle 1-based indexing.

2. **Array Processing:**
   - The loop iterates over the input array elements.
   - `j` is updated to the current index `i` if the current element `x` is different from the previous element `p`.
   - The array `a` is extended with the value of `j` at each step.
   - `p` is updated to the current element `x`, and `i` is incremented.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The number of queries `q` is read.
   - For each query, the range `[l, r]` is read.
   - The function checks if `a[r]` (which is the last index where a different element was found) is less than `l`. If so, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no such pair exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic correctly identifies the last index `j` where a different element was found up to the current index `i`.
  - For each query, it checks if this last index `a[r]` is within the query range `[l, r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is less than `l`, it means there are no different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases where the array has all identical elements within the query range.
  - It also handles the case where the array has different elements and correctly identifies the indices.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The code processes the array in O(n) time and handles each query in O(1) time, making it efficient for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It efficiently processes the input and handles all edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
