Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the iterable `R()`, `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` will be the last element of the iterable `R()`, and `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged. `l` and `r` are now the first and second elements of the iterable `R()`, respectively. `q` is now the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 1 and must be a truthy value.**
