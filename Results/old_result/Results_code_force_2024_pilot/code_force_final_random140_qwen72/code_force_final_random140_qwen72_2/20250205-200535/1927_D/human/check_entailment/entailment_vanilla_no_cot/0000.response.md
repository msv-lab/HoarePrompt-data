Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it processes the array `a` and determines the indices `i` and `j` for the queries. Specifically, the way it updates `j` and uses `a` to store the last differing index is not correct for the problem's requirements. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Update of `j`**: The update `(j, i)[x != p]` is intended to keep track of the last differing index, but this logic is flawed because it only updates `j` when the current element `x` is different from the previous element `p`. This means that if there are multiple consecutive elements that are the same, the value of `j` will not be updated correctly, leading to incorrect results for some queries.

2. **Incorrect Use of `a` Array**: The array `a` is being used to store the last differing index, but it is initialized with a zero and then appended with the value of `j`. This means that `a` does not directly represent the original array, and using `a[r]` to check for the last differing index within the range `[l, r]` is incorrect.

3. **Handling Queries**: The condition `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])` is intended to check if the last differing index is within the query range. However, due to the incorrect update of `j`, this check can fail, leading to incorrect outputs.

A correct approach would involve preprocessing the array to efficiently answer the queries. One possible method is to use a data structure like a segment tree or a sparse table to quickly find the first differing element within any given range. Alternatively, a simpler approach could involve iterating through the range for each query to find a pair of differing elements, although this might be less efficient for large inputs.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    def find_differing_pair(a, l, r):
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, r + 1):
                if a[i] != a[j]:
                    return i + 1, j + 1
        return -1, -1

    R = lambda: map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = next(R())
        a = list(R())
        (q,) = R()
        while q:
            q -= 1
            (l, r) = R()
            i, j = find_differing_pair(a, l - 1, r - 1)
            print(i, j)

func()
```

This version correctly finds a pair of differing elements within the specified range for each query.
