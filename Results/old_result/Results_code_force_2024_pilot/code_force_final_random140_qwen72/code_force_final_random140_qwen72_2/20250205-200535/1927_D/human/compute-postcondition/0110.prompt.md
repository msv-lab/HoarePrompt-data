You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5; l and r are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        R()
        
        a = [0]
        
        p = i = j = 0
        
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += j,
            p = x
            i += 1
        
        q, = R()
        
        while q:
            q -= 1
            l, r = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0, `i` will be the length of the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` will be the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element, `q` will be 0, `n` will remain unchanged, and `l` and `r` will be the last values read from the queries.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and a list of queries, each containing two integers `l` and `r`. It processes the queries on the list `a` and returns the results for each query.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
