The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is a truthy value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 2 and must be a truthy value. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must remain a truthy value.

State: **`l` and `r` are now the first and second elements of the iterable `R()`, respectively. `i` will be equal to the length of the iterable `R()`, `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` will be the last element of the iterable `R()`, and `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged except that `q` is now the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 2 and must be a truthy value.**
