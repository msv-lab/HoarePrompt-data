Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `j` is 0 or `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 2]` if `j` is 2, `p` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether `x` is equal to `p` or not, `t` is 0, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `q` is 0, `x` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `p` is now equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to be the same as `x`.
- All other variables (`i`, `a`, `j`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `q`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`, and `p` is now equal to this value.
