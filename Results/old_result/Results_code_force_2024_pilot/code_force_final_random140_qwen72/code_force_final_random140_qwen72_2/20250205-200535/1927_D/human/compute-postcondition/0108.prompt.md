Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    R()
    a = [0]
    p = i = j = 0
    for x in R():
        j = (j, i)[x != p]
        a += j,
        p = x
        i += 1
    q, = R()
    while q:
        q -= 1
        l, r = R()
        print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the iterable `R()`, `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` will be the last element of the iterable `R()`, and `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged. `q` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is the length of the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element, `t` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is the number of elements in the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is the index of the last element in the iterable returned by `R()` if all elements are distinct, otherwise it could be any previous index based on the condition `x != p`, `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., i-1]` if all elements in the iterable are distinct, or a list with some repeated indices based on the condition `x != p`, `t` is a truthy value minus 1, `n` remains unchanged, `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
