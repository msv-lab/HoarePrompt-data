The function `R()` is called, but there is no definition or implementation provided for this function. Without knowing what `R()` does, it's impossible to determine its exact impact on the program state. However, assuming `R()` does not modify any of the global variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`), the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**
