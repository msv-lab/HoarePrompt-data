To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of the iterable `R()`, respectively.
- `i` is the length of the iterable `R()`.
- `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration.
- `p` is the last element of the iterable `R()`.
- `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element.
- `q` is the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 3 and must be a truthy value.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Ternary Expression:**
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` is a ternary conditional expression.
   - It evaluates to `(a[r], r)` if `a[r] < l` is `False`.
   - It evaluates to `[-1, -1]` if `a[r] < l` is `True`.

2. **Evaluating `a[r] < l`:**
   - `a[r]` is the value in the list `a` at index `r`.
   - `l` is the first element of the iterable `R()`.
   - We need to determine whether `a[r]` is less than `l`.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `r` is the second element of the iterable `R()`, and `l` is the first element of the iterable `R()`, we need to know the values of these elements.
   - Let's assume the iterable `R()` is `[x, y, z, ...]`.
     - `l = x`
     - `r = y`
     - `a` is a list of values that `j` took during each iteration.
     - `a[r]` is the value in `a` at index `r`.

4. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If `a[r] >= l`, the expression will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, the expression will evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.

5. **Unpacking the Tuple:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the tuple or list.
   - If the expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)`, it will print `a[r]` and `r`.
   - If the expression evaluates to `[-1, -1]`, it will print `-1` and `-1`.

### Final Output:
Without the exact values of `a`, `l`, and `r`, we can't determine the precise numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the values of `a[r]` and `r` or `-1` and `-1` depending on the condition `a[r] < l`.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] >= l, otherwise (-1, -1) (where a[r] is the value in the list a at index r, r is the second element of the iterable R(), and l is the first element of the iterable R())**
