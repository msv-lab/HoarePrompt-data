Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the iterable `R()`, `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` will be the last element of the iterable `R()`, and `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. `q` is now the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()`.
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the iterable `R()`, `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` will be the last element of the iterable `R()`, and `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged. `l` and `r` are now the first and second elements of the iterable `R()`, respectively. `q` is now the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 1 and must be a truthy value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` and `r` are now the first and second elements of the iterable `R()`, respectively. `i` will be equal to the length of the iterable `R()`, `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` will be the last element of the iterable `R()`, and `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged except that `q` is now the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 2 and must be a truthy value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` and `r` are now the first and second elements of the iterable `R()`, respectively. `i` will be equal to the length of the iterable `R()`. `a` will be a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration. `p` will be the last element of the iterable `R()`. `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element. `q` is now the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 3 and must be a truthy value. `t` and `n` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
