The code snippet `t, = R()` assigns the first value from the map object returned by the function `R()` to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing this line, the value of `t` is updated to the specific integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**
