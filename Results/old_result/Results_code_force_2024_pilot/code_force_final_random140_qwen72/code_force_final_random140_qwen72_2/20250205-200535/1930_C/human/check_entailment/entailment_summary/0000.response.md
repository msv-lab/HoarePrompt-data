Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Set Operations**: For each element in the array `arr`, the program computes `arr[i] + i + 1` and adds this value to a set `st`. This step ensures that the set `S` contains unique elements, as required by the problem.

3. **Sorting and Printing**: After processing all elements, the program sorts the set `st` in descending order and prints the sorted elements. This step ensures that the array `b` is constructed in the lexicographically largest possible way.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

The program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
