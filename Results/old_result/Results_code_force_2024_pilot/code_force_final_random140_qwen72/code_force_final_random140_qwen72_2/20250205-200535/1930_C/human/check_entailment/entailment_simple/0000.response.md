Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by performing the specified operations on the array `a` and constructing the set `S` with the values `arr[i] + i + 1`. The final step is to sort the set `S` in descending order and print the result. Let's break down the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Reading Input**: It reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` of `n` integers.
   - **Set Operations**: It initializes an empty set `st` and iterates over the array `arr`. For each element `arr[i]`, it adds the value `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. This correctly implements the operation of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S` and deleting `a_i` from `a` (though the deletion from `a` is not explicitly shown, it is implied by the iteration).
   - **Output**: It sorts the set `st` in descending order and prints the sorted values. This correctly constructs the array `b` as required by the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including the maximum values for `t`, `n`, and the elements of `a`.
   - The use of a set ensures that only unique values are stored, which is consistent with the problem's requirement that `S` is a set and not a multiset.

4. **Optimality**:
   - The program always selects the last element in the array `arr` for the operation, which ensures that the values added to the set `st` are maximized. This approach is optimal because it ensures that the largest possible values are added to the set, leading to the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
