Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
4. `arr` is a list of integers read from input.
5. `st` contains the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
6. `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `st`**:
   - `st` is a list that contains the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, then:
     - `st[0] = arr[0] + 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
     - `st[1] = arr[1] + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`
     - `st[2] = arr[2] + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`
     - So, `st` would be `[2, 4, 6]`.

2. **Sorting `st`**:
   - The `sorted(st, reverse=True)` function sorts the list `st` in descending order.
   - Continuing with the example, `sorted([2, 4, 6], reverse=True)` would result in `[6, 4, 2]`.

3. **Printing the Sorted List**:
   - The `print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))` statement unpacks the sorted list and prints each element separated by spaces.
   - For the example, it would print `6 4 2`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the `print` statement will output the elements of the list `st` sorted in descending order.

Output: **[values of st sorted in descending order]** (where `st` is a list containing the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`).

For a more precise and human-readable format:
Output: **[values of st sorted in descending order]** (where each value in `st` is calculated as `arr[i] + i + 1` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`).
