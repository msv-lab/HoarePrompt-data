The code snippet adds a new element to the set `st`. This new element is calculated as `arr[i] + i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the new element added to `st` is `arr[2] + 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `arr[2] + 3`.

The initial state specifies that `st` already contains the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[1] + 2`. After executing the code, `st` will contain these two values plus the new value `arr[2] + 3`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `st` now contains the values `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, and `arr[2] + 3`, `i` is 2**.
