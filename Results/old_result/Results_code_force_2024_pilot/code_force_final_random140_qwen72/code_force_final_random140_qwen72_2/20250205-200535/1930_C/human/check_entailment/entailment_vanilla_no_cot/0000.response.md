Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the array, performing the specified operations, and then outputs the lexicographically largest array `b` by sorting the set `S` in descending order. The use of a set ensures that only unique values are stored, and the addition of `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set simulates the described operation. The final step of sorting the set in reverse order and printing its elements produces the desired output. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
