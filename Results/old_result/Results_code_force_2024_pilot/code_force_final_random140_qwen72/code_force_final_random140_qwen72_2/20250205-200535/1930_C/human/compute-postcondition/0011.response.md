The function `func_1` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. Each test case involves an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` represents the length of the array `a`, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and the elements of `a` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Given this context, the function likely processes each test case and returns some result based on the array `a` for each test case. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the processing of the array `a`.**
