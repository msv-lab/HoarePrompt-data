Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order, and `arr` must have at least 3 elements. `x` is the fourth element of `arr`. If `x >= ans[-1]`, then `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, the first element of `arr` minus 1, and the first element of `arr` minus 2. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, `x`, and `x - 1`.**
