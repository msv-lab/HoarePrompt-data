To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The array `a` consists of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order.
   - `ans` is a list where each element is either the corresponding element from `arr` or one less than the previous element in `ans`, ensuring that no element in `ans` is greater than the previous element.

2. **Understanding `arr`:**
   - Each element in `arr` is calculated as \( \text{index} + a_i \), where `index` starts from 1.
   - For example, if `a = [3, 1, 4]`, then `arr` would be `[1+3, 2+1, 3+4] = [4, 3, 7]`.
   - This list is then sorted in descending order, so `arr` becomes `[7, 4, 3]`.

3. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is constructed such that each element is either the corresponding element from `arr` or one less than the previous element in `ans`, ensuring that no element in `ans` is greater than the previous element.
   - For the sorted `arr = [7, 4, 3]`, `ans` would be constructed as follows:
     - First element: `7` (from `arr`).
     - Second element: `4` (from `arr`).
     - Third element: `3` (from `arr`).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the output will be the elements of `ans` in the order they are constructed, which is the same as the sorted `arr` in descending order.

Output: **7 4 3 (where the elements are the values from the sorted `arr` in descending order)**

This format ensures that the output is clear and matches the structure of the problem.
