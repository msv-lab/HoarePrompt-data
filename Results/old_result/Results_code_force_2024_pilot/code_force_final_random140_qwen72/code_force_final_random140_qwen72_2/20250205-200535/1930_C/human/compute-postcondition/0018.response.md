Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order, and `ans` is a list where each element is either the corresponding element from `arr` or one less than the previous element in `ans`, ensuring that no element in `ans` is greater than the previous element.**

Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is only used for iteration and not modified.
- The list `ans` starts with the first element of `arr` and is updated in each iteration based on the condition `if x >= ans[-1]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, the next element in `ans` is `ans[-1] - 1`. Otherwise, the next element in `ans` is `x`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will contain a sequence of integers where each element is either the corresponding element from `arr` or one less than the previous element in `ans`, ensuring that the sequence is non-increasing.
