Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order, and `arr` must have at least 3 elements. `x` is the third element of `arr`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` minus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and `x`.**
