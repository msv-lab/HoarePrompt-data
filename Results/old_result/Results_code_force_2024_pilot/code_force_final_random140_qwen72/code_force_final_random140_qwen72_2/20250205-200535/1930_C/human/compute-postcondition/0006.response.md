Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `st` now contains the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[1] + 2`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `st` contains the value `arr[0] + 1`.
- The code `st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)` adds the value `arr[1] + 2` to the set `st`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
