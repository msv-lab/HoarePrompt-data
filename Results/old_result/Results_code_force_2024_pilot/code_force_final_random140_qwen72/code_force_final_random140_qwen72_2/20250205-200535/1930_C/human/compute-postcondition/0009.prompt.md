Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. n is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. arr is a list of integers read from input, split by spaces and converted to integers. st is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `st` contains the value `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `st` now contains the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[1] + 2`, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `st` now contains the values `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, and `arr[2] + 3`, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
