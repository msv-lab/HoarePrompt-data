Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is an input string, `a` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, the input for the loop must be greater than 1.**
