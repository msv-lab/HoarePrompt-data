The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes. `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, consisting of '0's and '1's, representing the initial and final positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns the minimum number of moves required to change the initial positions of the cats (`s`) to the final positions (`f`) for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of boxes, and `s` and `f` are strings representing the initial and final positions of the cats in the boxes. It returns the minimum number of moves required to change the initial positions to the final positions for each test case.**
