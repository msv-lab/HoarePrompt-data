Output State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `b` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `t = input()` updates the value of `t` to a new input string. All other variables (`_`, `n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
