The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]`, `b` is 1 if `s[0]` is less than `t[0]` otherwise `b` is 0, `i` is 1**
