The value of `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] > t[i]` is true, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. Since `i` is 1, the comparison is made between `s[1]` and `t[1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `b` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[1] > t[1]`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged.**
