Output State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets both `a` and `b` to 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
