The code snippet `b += s[i] < t[i]` updates the value of `b` based on the comparison between `s[i]` and `t[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the comparison is between `s[0]` and `t[0]`. The value of `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is less than `t[0]`, otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[0] > t[0]`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[0] < t[0]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**
