t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes. s and f are strings of length n, consisting of '0's and '1's, where s[i] = '1' indicates a cat is present in the i-th box initially, and f[i] = '1' indicates a cat should be present in the i-th box finally. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
