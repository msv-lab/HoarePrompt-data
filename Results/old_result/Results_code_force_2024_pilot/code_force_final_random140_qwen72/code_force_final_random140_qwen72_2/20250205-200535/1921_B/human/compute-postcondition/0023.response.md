The value of `b` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is less than the character at index `i` in `t`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. The other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 0, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains 0, `i` is managed by the loop and starts from 0.**
