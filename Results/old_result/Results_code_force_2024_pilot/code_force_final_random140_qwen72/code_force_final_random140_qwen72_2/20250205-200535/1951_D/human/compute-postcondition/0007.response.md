The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or their values. It simply prints the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
