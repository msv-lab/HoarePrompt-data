Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is a static string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
