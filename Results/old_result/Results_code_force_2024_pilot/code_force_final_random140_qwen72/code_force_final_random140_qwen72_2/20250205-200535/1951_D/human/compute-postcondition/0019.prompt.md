You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: (n - k + 1, 1) (where n - k + 1 is the result of the expression n - k + 1 and 1 is the constant integer value)
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is true. Otherwise, `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.
        #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is true. If `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, the condition `(k - 1 >= n - k + 1)` is true.
    #State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. If `n` is less than `k`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition holds as is. Additionally, if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is true. If `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, the condition `(k - 1 >= n - k + 1)` is true.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters representing the number of test cases (`t`), the number of coins Alice has (`n`), and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (`k`). For each test case, it processes the values of `n` and `k` and returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
