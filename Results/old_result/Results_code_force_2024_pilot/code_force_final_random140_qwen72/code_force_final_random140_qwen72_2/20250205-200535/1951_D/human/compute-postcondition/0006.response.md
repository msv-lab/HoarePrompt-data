Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

This code snippet does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
