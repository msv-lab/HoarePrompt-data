The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` represents the number of coins Alice has and `k` represents the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy. It then checks the relationship between `n` and `k` and prints one of the following outputs based on the conditions:
- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES" followed by two lines, each containing the number 1.
- If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", followed by the number 2, and then the values `n - k + 1` and 1 on the next line.
- If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, it prints "NO".
