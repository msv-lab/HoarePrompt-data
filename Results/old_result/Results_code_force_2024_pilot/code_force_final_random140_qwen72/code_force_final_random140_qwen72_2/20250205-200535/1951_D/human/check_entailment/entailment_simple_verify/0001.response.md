### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `for _ in range(int(input()))`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Base Case Check:**
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin each.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The condition `if k - 1 < n - k + 1` is used to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
     - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES" followed by 2 and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
       - This means Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic checks if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up at most 2 stalls.
- The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall without exceeding her total coins `n`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** `n < k` (e.g., `n = 5`, `k = 6`)
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)
- **Case 2:** `n == k` (e.g., `n = 5`, `k = 5`)
  - Output: "YES\n1\n1" (Correct)
- **Case 3:** `k - 1 < n - k + 1` (e.g., `n = 10`, `k = 4`)
  - Output: "YES\n2\n7 1" (Correct)
- **Case 4:** `k - 1 >= n - k + 1` (e.g., `n = 10`, `k = 6`)
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)

### Additional Considerations:
- The program only considers up to 2 stalls, which is a limitation. However, the problem specifies that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, and the program should ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- The current logic is sufficient for the given constraints and edge cases, but it does not explore the possibility of using more than 2 stalls, which might be necessary for some complex cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and edge cases within the constraints provided. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels if possible, and otherwise determines that it is impossible.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
