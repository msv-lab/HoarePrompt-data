The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. These values will replace the previous placeholders for `n` and `k` in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are now specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.**
