The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters related to the number of test cases (`t`), the number of coins Alice has (`n`), and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (`k`). Given the constraints, the function is expected to process each test case and determine some outcome based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters representing the number of test cases (`t`), the number of coins Alice has (`n`), and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (`k`). For each test case, it processes the values of `n` and `k` and returns a result based on these inputs.**
