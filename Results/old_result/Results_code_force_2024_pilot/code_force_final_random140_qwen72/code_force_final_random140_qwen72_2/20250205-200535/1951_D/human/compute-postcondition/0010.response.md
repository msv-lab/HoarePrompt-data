Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is true, meaning that `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement, as it is a static string.

Output: **YES**
