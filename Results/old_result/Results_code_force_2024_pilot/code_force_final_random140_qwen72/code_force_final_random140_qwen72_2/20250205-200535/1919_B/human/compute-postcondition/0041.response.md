Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a new input integer.
- `e` is a new input string.
- `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`.
- `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.
- `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(abs(P - M))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Variables:**
   - `s` is an integer, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
   - `e` is a string, and we need to count the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of other characters (`M`).

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`.
   - `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

3. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - The expression `abs(P - M)` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of other characters in the string `e`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the absolute difference between `P` and `M`.

### Example:
- If `e = "++a+b+c"`, then:
  - `P = 3` (number of '+' characters).
  - `M = 4` (number of other characters: 'a', 'b', 'c').
  - `abs(P - M) = abs(3 - 4) = 1`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of other characters in the string `e`.

Output: **abs(P - M) (where P is the number of '+' characters in e and M is the number of characters in e that are not '+')**
