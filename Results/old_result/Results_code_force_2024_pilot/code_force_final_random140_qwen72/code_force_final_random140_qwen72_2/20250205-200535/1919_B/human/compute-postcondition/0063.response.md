Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` has reached the value provided by `int(input())`, and for each iteration, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the corresponding input string `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`. The absolute difference between `P` and `M` for each iteration has been printed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and for each input string `e` processed during these iterations, the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of '-' characters (`M`) were counted, and the absolute difference between these counts was printed. The loop variable `i` has now reached the total number of iterations specified by the initial input.
