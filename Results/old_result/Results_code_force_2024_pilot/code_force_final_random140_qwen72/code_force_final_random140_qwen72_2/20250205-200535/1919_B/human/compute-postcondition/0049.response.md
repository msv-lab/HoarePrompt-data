Output State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string with at least 1 character, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `q` is the first character of `e`, and `q` is equal to '+'**

Explanation:
- The value of `P` is incremented by 1, so `P` is now 1.
- All other variables (`s`, `e`, `M`, `i`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
