Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting only of characters '+' and '-'
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(abs(P - M))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+', `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
