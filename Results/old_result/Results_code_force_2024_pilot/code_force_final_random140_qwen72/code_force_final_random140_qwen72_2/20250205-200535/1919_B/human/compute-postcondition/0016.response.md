The value of `P` is incremented by 1. Initially, `P` is 2 if `q` is `+`, and 0 otherwise. After the increment, `P` will be 3 if `q` is `+`, and 1 otherwise. The values of `s`, `e`, and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in `e`. If `q` is `+`, then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.**
