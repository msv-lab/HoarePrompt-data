The value of `M` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `q` is `+`, then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2. After the increment, if `q` is `+`, `M` becomes 1. Otherwise, `M` becomes 3. The values of `s`, `e`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in `e`, if `q` is `+`, then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 3.**
