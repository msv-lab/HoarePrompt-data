Reasoning:  
The provided program does not fully solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array optimally, but the program simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty, which involves more complex logic than just counting the '+' and '-' characters.

For example, in the third test case where `s = "+-+-+"`, the optimal split would be `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a penalty of 0. However, the program would output `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is coincidentally correct in this case but does not follow the required logic of splitting the array.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required algorithm to find the minimum possible penalty by considering all possible splits of the array.

Correctness: **False**
