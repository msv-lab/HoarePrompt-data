The value of `P` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `q` is the next character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**
