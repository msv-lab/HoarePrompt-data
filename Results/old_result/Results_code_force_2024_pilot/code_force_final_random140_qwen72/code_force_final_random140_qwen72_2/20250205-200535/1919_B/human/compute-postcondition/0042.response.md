The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the comparison between `i` and the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The value provided by `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+', `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`**
