Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string `s`. However, this approach does not correctly implement the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized, which involves more than just counting the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array. The current program simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not equivalent to the minimum penalty calculation required by the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
