Output State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `P` will hold the count of how many times the character '+' appears in the string `e`, and the variable `M` will hold the count of all other characters in `e` that are not '+'. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop, and `i` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, but it must still be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.
