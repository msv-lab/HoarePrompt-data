### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-'.
   - Each '+' corresponds to `1` and each '-' corresponds to `-1`.
   - We need to split the array `a` derived from `s` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to balance the subarrays so that their sums are as close to zero as possible.
   - If the entire array `a` has a sum of zero, the optimal way to split it is to keep it as one subarray, resulting in a penalty of zero.
   - If the sum is not zero, the optimal way to split it is to ensure that each subarray has a sum of either 1 or -1, which minimizes the penalty.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It initializes two counters `P` and `M` to count the number of '+' and '-' respectively.
   - It iterates through the string and increments `P` for each '+' and `M` for each '-'.
   - Finally, it prints the absolute difference between `P` and `M`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of '+' and '-' in the string.
   - The final output is the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which is equivalent to the sum of the array `a`.
   - However, the program does not consider the optimal splitting strategy to minimize the penalty. It simply calculates the sum of the entire array and outputs the absolute value of this sum.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the optimal splitting strategy to minimize the penalty.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
