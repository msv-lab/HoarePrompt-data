Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- For each of the `t` test cases:
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and is set to the input value.
  - If `n` is 3, no changes are made.
  - Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is set to `n - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive.
- In each iteration of the loop, `n` is set to an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
- If `n` is 3, no changes are made.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 3 (which is always true since `n` is at least 3), `i` is set to `n - 2`.

However, the code snippet `print(1)` does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(1)` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **1**
