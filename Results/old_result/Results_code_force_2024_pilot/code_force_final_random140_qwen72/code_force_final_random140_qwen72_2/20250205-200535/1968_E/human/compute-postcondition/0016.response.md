Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Given this information, let's determine the value of `i`:

1. Since `n` is at least 2, the smallest value `i` can take is `2 + 2 = 4`.
2. Therefore, `i` will always be at least 4, and it will be exactly `n + 2`.

When the `print(i, i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i` twice.

Output: **i, i (where i is n + 2 and n is greater than or equal to 2)**
