Initial State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than the original `n + 2`.

Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer, and it is stated that `n` is greater than the original `n + 2`. This is a contradiction because `n` cannot be greater than `n + 2`. Therefore, this precondition is logically inconsistent.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(1, 1)`.
   - This statement does not depend on the values of `i` or `n`. It simply prints the integers 1 and 1.

Given the logical inconsistency in the initial state, the print statement will still execute independently of the initial state.

Output: **1, 1**
