Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the program always starts with the points (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints points (i, i) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n+1 \). This approach does not ensure that the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized for all \( n \).

For example, for \( n = 3 \), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
This results in the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 4\}\), which has a size of 3. However, a better arrangement could be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), having a size of 4.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
