The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1, 2)
```

### Initial State Analysis:
- `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
- `n` is an input integer that is greater than the original `n + 2`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables defined in the initial state.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the integers `1` and `2`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the numbers 1 and 2 separated by a space.
Output: **1 2**
