Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` being 0 and `n` being some integer greater than 0.
- The loop iterates over the range from 3 to `n + 2` (inclusive).
- Each iteration of the loop prints the value of `i` twice and then increments `i` by 1.
- After the loop finishes executing, `i` will have been incremented to `n + 1` because the loop stops when `i` reaches `n + 2`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.

Thus, the final output state is `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged.
