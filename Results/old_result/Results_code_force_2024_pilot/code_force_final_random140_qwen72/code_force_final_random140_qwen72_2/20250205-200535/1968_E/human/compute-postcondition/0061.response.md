Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `i`.
- The `end=' '` argument ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Given that `i` is explicitly defined as 3, the output will be:

Output: **3 **
