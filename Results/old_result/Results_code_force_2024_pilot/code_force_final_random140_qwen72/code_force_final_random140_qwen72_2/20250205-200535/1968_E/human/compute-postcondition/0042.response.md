The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5**
