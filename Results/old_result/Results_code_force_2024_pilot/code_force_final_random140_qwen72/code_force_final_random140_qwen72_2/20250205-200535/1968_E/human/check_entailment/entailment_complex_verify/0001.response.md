Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to place `n` points in an `n x n` grid such that the number of unique Manhattan distances between any two points is maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` for the first two points.
   - For the remaining points, it prints `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n + 1`.

3. **Evaluation of the Solution**:
   - The first two points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` are fixed and will always be part of the solution.
   - The remaining points are placed along the diagonal starting from `(3, 3)` to `(n, n)`.
   - This approach ensures that the points are spread out diagonally, which helps in maximizing the number of unique Manhattan distances.

4. **Checking for Unique Distances**:
   - The points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` will have a Manhattan distance of 1.
   - The points `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` will have a Manhattan distance of `i - 1 + i - 1 = 2(i - 1)`.
   - The points `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` will have a Manhattan distance of `i - 1 + i - 2 = 2i - 3`.
   - The points `(i, i)` and `(j, j)` for `i < j` will have a Manhattan distance of `|i - j| + |i - j| = 2|i - j|`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program ensures that the points are placed in a way that maximizes the number of unique Manhattan distances.
   - However, the program has a small issue: it prints one extra point beyond the grid size `n`. Specifically, it prints up to `(n+1, n+1)`, which is outside the `n x n` grid. This is incorrect because the grid is `n x n`, and the coordinates should not exceed `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the range of the loop. The loop should run from 3 to `n + 1` instead of `n + 2`.

Final: **False**
