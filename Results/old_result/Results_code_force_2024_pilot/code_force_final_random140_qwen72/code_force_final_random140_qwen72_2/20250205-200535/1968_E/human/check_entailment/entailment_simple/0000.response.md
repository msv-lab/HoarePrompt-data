Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by printing a specific pattern of coordinates for each test case. However, the approach taken does not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for every test case, followed by a diagonal starting from (3, 3) up to (n+1, n+1). This approach does not consider the full range of possible distances and may not generate the maximum number of unique distances for larger values of \(n\).

For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
This results in the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 4\}\), which has 3 elements. However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) should include more unique distances, as shown in the problem statement.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where \(n = 2\) correctly. For \(n = 2\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
This is incorrect because the third point (3, 3) is outside the 2x2 grid.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
