Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

The `print` statement will print the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 3.

Output: **3**
