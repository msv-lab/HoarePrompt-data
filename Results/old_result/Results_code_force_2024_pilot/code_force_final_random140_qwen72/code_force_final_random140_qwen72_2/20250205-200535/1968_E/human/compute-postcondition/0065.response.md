Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and is set to the input value.
- If `n` is 3, no changes are made.
- Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is set to `n - 2`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints a single space character.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **' '**
