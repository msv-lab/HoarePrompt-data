To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged.
- **Loop Statement**:
  ```python
  for i in range(0, int(input())):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the upper bound of the range, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The upper bound `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

5. **New State**:
   - After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 2`**
