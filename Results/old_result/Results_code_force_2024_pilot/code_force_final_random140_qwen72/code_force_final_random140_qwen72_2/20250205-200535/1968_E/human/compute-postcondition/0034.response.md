Functionality: **The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context, it processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it expects an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result (e.g., a value, a list, etc.) is not specified in the given information.**
