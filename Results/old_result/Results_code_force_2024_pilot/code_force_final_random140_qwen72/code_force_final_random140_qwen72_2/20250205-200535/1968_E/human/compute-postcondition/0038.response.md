Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- If `n` is 3, `j` remains undefined.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.
- Otherwise, `j` remains undefined.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('2 3')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'2 3'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 3**
