Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is initialized to 1 by the loop.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
Output: **1** (followed by a space)
