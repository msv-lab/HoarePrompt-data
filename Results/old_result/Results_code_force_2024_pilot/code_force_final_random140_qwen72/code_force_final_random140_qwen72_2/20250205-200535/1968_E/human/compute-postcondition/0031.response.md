Initial State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The variable `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
2. The variable `n` is given to be greater than 1.
3. The `print` statement outputs the value of `i` twice.

Given that `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 1, the value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **(n + 1), (n + 1) (where n is greater than 1)**
