Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 3 and iterates up to `n + 1` (since the range is `range(3, n + 2)`).
- After each iteration, `i` increments by 1.
- The loop will run until `i` reaches `n + 2`, but it will stop just before `i` becomes `n + 2` because the loop condition is `i < n + 2`.
- Therefore, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 2`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
