The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function likely accepts at least one parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.

Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, I will assume that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each `n` in the test cases. Without more specific information about the output, I'll describe the functionality in general terms.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 50. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each `n`.**
