Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n + 1`**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `j` set to 4 and iterates as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
- After each iteration, `j` increments by 1.
- For the loop to complete all its iterations, `j` must reach `n + 1` (since the loop condition is `j <= n`).
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `j` will be `n + 1`.
- The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
