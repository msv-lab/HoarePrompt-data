The value of `n` is updated to the new input value, which is an integer greater than the original `i` (which was `n + 2`). The value of `i` remains `n + 2` based on the initial state, but now `n` has a new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than the original `n + 2`.
Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than the original `n + 2`**
