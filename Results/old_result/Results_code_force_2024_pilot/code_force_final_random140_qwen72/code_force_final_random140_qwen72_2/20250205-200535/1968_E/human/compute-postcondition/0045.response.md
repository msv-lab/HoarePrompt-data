Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is 6.

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 6.
2. The print statement converts `j` to a string and concatenates it with a space and another string representation of `j`.
3. Therefore, the output will be the string "6 6".

Output: **6 6**
