To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions specified in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(3, n + 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `3`, and `n`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range(3, n + 2)` function generates a sequence starting from 3 up to (but not including) `n + 2`.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value. This means that the start value (3) must be less than the stop value (`n + 2`).

### Adjusting the State:
- **Initial State**: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- **Required Condition**: For the loop to execute, `3` must be less than `n + 2`.

Given that `n` is already greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n + 2` is greater than 3. This simplifies to `n > 1`.

### Final State:
- `i` is 0 (unchanged because it is set inside the loop).
- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
