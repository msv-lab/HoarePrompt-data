The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 50. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3). It then prints a series of pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and for each integer `i` from 3 to `n + 1`, it prints (i, i). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the program state reflects the printed output for each test case.
