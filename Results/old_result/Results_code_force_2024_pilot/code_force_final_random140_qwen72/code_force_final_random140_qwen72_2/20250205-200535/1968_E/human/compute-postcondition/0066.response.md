Output State: **`t` is 0. For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and is set to the input value. If `n` is 3, no changes are made. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is set to `n - 2`.**

### Explanation:
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0.
- The variable `n` is set to the input value for each test case, and this value is within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- If `n` is 3, no additional changes are made.
- If `n` is not 3, the loop will print the values as specified, and the variable `i` will be set to `n - 2` during the execution of the inner loop.
- The state of other variables not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
