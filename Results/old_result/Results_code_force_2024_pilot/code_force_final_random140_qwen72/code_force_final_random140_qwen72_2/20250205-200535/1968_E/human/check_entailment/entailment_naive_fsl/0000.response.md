Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate a set of points that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances (\(\mathcal{H}\)) for every \(n\). 

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 2
```
However, this set of points does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- Between (1, 1) and (2, 2): \(|1-2| + |1-2| = 2\)
- Between (1, 2) and (2, 2): \(|1-2| + |2-2| = 1\)

The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2\}\), which has a size of 2. However, a better arrangement could be:
```
1 1
1 3
3 1
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (1, 1) and (1, 3): \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Between (1, 1) and (3, 1): \(|1-3| + |1-1| = 2\)
- Between (1, 3) and (3, 1): \(|1-3| + |3-1| = 4\)

The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{2, 4\}\), which has a size of 2. However, the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\) is 3, which can be achieved with the arrangement:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- Between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 3.

Thus, the program does not always generate the optimal set of points for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
