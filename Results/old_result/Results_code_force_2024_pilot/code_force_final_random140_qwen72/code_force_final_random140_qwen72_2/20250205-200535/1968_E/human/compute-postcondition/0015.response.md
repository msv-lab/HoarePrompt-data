To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(3, n + 2):` will execute if the range from 3 to `n + 2` (exclusive) contains at least one value. This means `n + 2` must be greater than 3, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` is an input integer greater than the original `n + 2`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Since `i` is not used in the loop head (it is reassigned by the loop), we don't need to adjust it. We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
