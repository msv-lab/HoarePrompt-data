The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n + 2`. The loop starts with `i` being 3 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. However, since the loop starts with `i` being 3, this means that the loop has not yet started (as `i` should be 3 at the start of the first iteration). Therefore, at the start of the first iteration, `i` should be 3, and for the loop to execute, `n` must be such that `n + 2` is greater than 3.

Thus, the state at the start of the first iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
