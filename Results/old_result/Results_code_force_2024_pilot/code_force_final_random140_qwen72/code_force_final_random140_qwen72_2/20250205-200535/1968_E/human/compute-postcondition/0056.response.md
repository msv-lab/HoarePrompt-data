Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is initialized to 1 by the loop.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is explicitly initialized to 1, the value of `i` when the `print` statement is executed is 1.

Output: **1**
