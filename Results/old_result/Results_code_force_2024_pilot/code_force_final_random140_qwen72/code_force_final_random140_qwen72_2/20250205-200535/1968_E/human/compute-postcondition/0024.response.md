The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1, 1)
```

### Initial State Analysis:
- `i` is defined as the original `n + 3`.
- `n` is an input integer that is greater than the original `n + 3`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the numbers `1` and `1`.
- The values of `1` and `1` are constants and do not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will always be `1 1`, regardless of the values of `i` or `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 1**
