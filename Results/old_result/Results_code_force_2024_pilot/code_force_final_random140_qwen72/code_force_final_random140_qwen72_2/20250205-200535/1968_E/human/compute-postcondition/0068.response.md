Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). It then prints a series of numbers based on the value of `n`. Specifically, it prints `n`, `n`, `n`, and `n-1` on separate lines. If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `2` and `1` on separate lines. For any other value of `n`, it prints the numbers from 1 to `n-2` twice on separate lines. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0. **
