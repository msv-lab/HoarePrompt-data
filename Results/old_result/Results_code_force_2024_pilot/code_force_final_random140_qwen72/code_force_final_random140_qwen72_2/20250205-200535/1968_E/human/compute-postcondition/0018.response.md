Initial State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The variable `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
2. The variable `n` is given to be greater than or equal to 2.
3. Therefore, `i` will be at least 4 (since the minimum value of `n` is 2, so `i = 2 + 2 = 4`).
4. The `print` statement outputs the value of `i` twice.

Based on this, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **i, i (where i is n + 2 and n is greater than or equal to 2)**

For example, if `n` is 2, then `i` will be 4, and the output will be:
Output: **4, 4**
