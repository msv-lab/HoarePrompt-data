Initial State: `i` is the original `n + 3`, and `n` must be greater than 1.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The variable `i` is defined as `n + 3`.
2. The value of `n` is greater than 1, but the exact value of `n` is not specified.
3. The print statement `print(i, i)` will print the value of `i` twice.

Since `i` is defined as `n + 3`, and `n` is greater than 1, the value of `i` will be `n + 3` where `n > 1`.

Output: **i, i (where i is n + 3 and n is greater than 1)**
