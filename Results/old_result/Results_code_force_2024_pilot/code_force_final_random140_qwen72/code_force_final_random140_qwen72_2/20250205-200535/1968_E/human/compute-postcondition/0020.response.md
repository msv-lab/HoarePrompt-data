Initial State: `i` is `n + 3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The variable `i` is defined as `n + 3`.
2. The variable `n` is given to be greater than or equal to 2.
3. Therefore, `i` will be `n + 3`, where `n` is at least 2.
4. The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Since `n` is at least 2, the smallest possible value for `i` is `2 + 3 = 5`.

Output: **i, i (where i is n + 3 and n is greater than or equal to 2)**

For example, if `n` is 2, then `i` will be 5, and the output will be:
Output: **5, 5**
