Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 50`. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3). It then prints specific pairs of integers based on the value of `n`: it always prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. If `n` is 3, it prints `(2, 3)`. If `n` is 4 or greater, it prints `(2, 4)` followed by `(j, j)` for each `j` from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
