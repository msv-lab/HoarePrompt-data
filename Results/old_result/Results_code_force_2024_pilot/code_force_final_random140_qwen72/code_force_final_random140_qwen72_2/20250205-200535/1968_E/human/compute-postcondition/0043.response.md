Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `j` is 5.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

This statement converts the integer `j` to a string, concatenates it with a space, and then concatenates it again with another string representation of `j`.

Given that `j` is 5, the output will be:
- `str(j)` is `'5'`.
- `'5' + ' ' + '5'` results in `'5 5'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **5 5**
