Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is explicitly defined as 2, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **2**
