The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` now contains `v` and `u` (duplicated), `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**
