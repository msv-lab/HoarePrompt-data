The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of `node` and `nei` remain unchanged, and the condition that `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, `node` is equal to `start`, `nei` is equal to `end`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
Output State: **`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, `node` is equal to `start`, `nei` is equal to `end`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
