Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `prev` will contain all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, and `que` will contain all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that were processed. If `node` is equal to `end`, the loop will terminate early. Otherwise, the loop will continue until there are no more elements in `que`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were encountered during the loop execution, where each key is a node and its value is the node that led to it (its predecessor).
- The `que` list will contain all the nodes that are still waiting to be processed, i.e., the unvisited neighbors of the nodes that have already been processed.
- If the `node` variable ever becomes equal to `end`, the loop will stop immediately.
- If the loop completes without finding the `end` node, `que` will be empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed.
