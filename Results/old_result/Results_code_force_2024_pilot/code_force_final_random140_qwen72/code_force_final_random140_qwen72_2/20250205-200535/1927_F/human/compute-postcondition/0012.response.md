Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` now contains `v` and `u` (duplicated), `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new tuple `(w, u, v)` to the `edges` list.
- The `edges` list now contains two tuples: the original `(w, u, v)` and the newly added `(w, u, v)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `graph`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `w`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
