Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `prev` will contain all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, and `que` will contain all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that were processed, except for the node that was just removed from the front of `que`. The variable `node` now holds the value of the node that was at the front of `que`. If `node` is equal to `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
