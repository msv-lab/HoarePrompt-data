Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

The function reads a single line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and returns an iterator over these integers.

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` constructs a graph from a given set of edges and finds the minimum weight cycle in the graph. It takes no explicit parameters but internally uses `func_3` to read the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and the edges themselves. The function then creates a graph representation using a defaultdict and a list of edges. It sorts the edges in descending order by weight and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to find the minimum weight cycle. If a cycle is found, it determines the start and end nodes of the cycle and reconstructs the path. Finally, it prints the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the length of the path, followed by the nodes in the path in reverse order. If no cycle is found, it prints the minimum edge weight as infinity and an empty path.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls `func_1` to determine the number of test cases, then iterates this many times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function completes, `func_6` will have been called a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_1`.
