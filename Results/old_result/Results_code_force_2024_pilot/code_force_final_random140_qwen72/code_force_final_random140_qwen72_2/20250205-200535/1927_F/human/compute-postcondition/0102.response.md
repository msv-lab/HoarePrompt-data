Postcondition: ***`nei` is the next value from `graph[node]`, and `graph[node]` remains unchanged. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.***
