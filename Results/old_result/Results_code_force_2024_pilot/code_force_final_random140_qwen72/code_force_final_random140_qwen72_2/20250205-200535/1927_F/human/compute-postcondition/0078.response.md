Output State: **All neighbors of `node` have been processed. For each neighbor `nei` of `node` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. The `que` contains all unvisited neighbors of `node` that were not previously in `prev`. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited and their respective predecessors.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, all the neighbors of the current `node` have been checked. If a neighbor `nei` was not already in the `prev` dictionary, it has been added to both `prev` and `que`. If the `node` is the same as `start` and the neighbor `nei` is the same as `end`, the loop skips processing that neighbor. The `que` now contains all unvisited neighbors of `node` that were not previously in `prev`, and the `prev` dictionary tracks the path taken through the graph.
