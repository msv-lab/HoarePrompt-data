Output State: **All variables retain their values from the initial state, and the loop or conditional block is exited.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block immediately. No changes are made to the variables `que`, `node`, `n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`, and `prev`. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state, except that the program flow is now outside the loop or conditional block where the `break` statement was encountered.
