The code snippet updates the `prev` dictionary by setting the value of `prev[nei]` to `node`. This means that the predecessor of `nei` is now set to `node`.

Output State: **`nei` is the next value from `graph[node]`, and `graph[node]` remains unchanged. `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
