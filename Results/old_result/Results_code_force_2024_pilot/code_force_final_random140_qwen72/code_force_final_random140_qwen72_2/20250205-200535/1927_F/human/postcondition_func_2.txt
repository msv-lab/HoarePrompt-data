The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator that yields integer values from the input provided through standard input (stdin), where each value is separated by whitespace. The function reads a single line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and returns an iterator over these integers.
