To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `graph[node]` is a non-empty iterable.
- `nei` takes on the values from `graph[node]` during each iteration.
- If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration is skipped.
- If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `nei` is appended to `que`.
- If `nei` is already in `prev`, no changes are made.

### Loop Head:
```python
for nei in graph[node]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `nei`.
   - `graph[node]` is the iterable from which `nei` takes its values.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must still have elements left to iterate over.
   - The value of `nei` should be the next element in `graph[node]`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `nei` is the variable being iterated over, it will take the next value from `graph[node]`.
   - The state of `graph[node]` remains unchanged as it is an iterable and does not get modified by the loop itself.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `nei` will take the next value from `graph[node]`. The state of `graph[node]` remains the same, and `nei` will be updated to the next element in the iterable.

### Final State:
State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty iterable, `nei` is the next value from `graph[node]`**
