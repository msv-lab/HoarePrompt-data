Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` is a non-empty iterable, `nei` takes on the values from `graph[node]` during each iteration. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration is skipped. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `nei` is appended to `que`. If `nei` is already in `prev`, no changes are made.***
