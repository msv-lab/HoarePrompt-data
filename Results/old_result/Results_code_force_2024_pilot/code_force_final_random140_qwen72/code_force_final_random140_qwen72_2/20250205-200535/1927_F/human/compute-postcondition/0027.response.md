Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `m-1`, `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`, `_min_edge` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `start` is set to -1, `end` is set to -1, `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`, and `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`.**
