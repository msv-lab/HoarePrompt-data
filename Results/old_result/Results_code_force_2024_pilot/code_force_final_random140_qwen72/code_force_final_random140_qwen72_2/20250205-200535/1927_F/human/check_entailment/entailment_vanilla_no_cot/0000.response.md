Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge, and outputs the required results. The use of a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure helps in efficiently finding cycles, and the breadth-first search (BFS) is used to reconstruct the cycle once a potential edge forming a cycle is found. The logic and structure of the code align with the requirements of the problem statement.
