For the given `while` loop to execute at least once, the condition `que` must evaluate to `True`. In Python, a non-empty collection (like a list, deque, etc.) evaluates to `True` in a boolean context. Therefore, the deque `que` must contain at least one element for the loop to start.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `que` is a deque initialized with `[start]`.

Since `que` is already initialized with a single element `[start]`, it is non-empty and will evaluate to `True` in the loop condition. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`que` is a deque initialized with `[start]`, `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. The value of `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`. A new instance of the `DSU` class is created with the size `n + 1` and assigned to the variable `dsu`. `_min_edge` is set to the smallest weight `w` of any edge `(w, u, v)` where `u` and `v` had the same parent before the union operation, or it remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`) if no such edge exists. `start` is set to the `u` value of the edge with the smallest `w` where `u` and `v` had the same parent, or it remains set to -1 if no such edge exists. `end` is set to the `v` value of the edge with the smallest `w` where `u` and `v` had the same parent, or it remains set to -1 if no such edge exists. All nodes `u` and `v` that were processed in the loop are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure. `prev` is a dictionary with the key `start` and the value `-1`.**
