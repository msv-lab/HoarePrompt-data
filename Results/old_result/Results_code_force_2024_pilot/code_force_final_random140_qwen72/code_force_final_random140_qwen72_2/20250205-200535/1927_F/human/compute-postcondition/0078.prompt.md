Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`que` is a deque initialized with the remaining elements after the first element (which was `start`) is removed, `node` is set to the value of `start`, `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. The value of `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`. A new instance of the `DSU` class is created with the size `n + 1` and assigned to the variable `dsu`. `_min_edge` is set to the smallest weight `w` of any edge `(w, u, v)` where `u` and `v` had the same parent before the union operation, or it remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`) if no such edge exists. `start` is set to the `u` value of the edge with the smallest `w` where `u` and `v` had the same parent, or it remains set to -1 if no such edge exists. `end` is set to the `v` value of the edge with the smallest `w` where `u` and `v` had the same parent, or it remains set to -1 if no such edge exists. All nodes `u` and `v` that were processed in the loop are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure. `prev` is a dictionary with the key `start` and the value `-1`. If `node` equals `end`, the loop or conditional block is exited, and all variables retain their values from the initial state. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next part of the code.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`node` is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in the `prev` set, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`node` is a key in `graph` with at least two neighbors, and `nei` is the second neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` is updated to include `nei`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`node` is a key in `graph` with at least three neighbors, and `nei` is the third neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
