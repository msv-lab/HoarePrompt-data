Output State: **`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the value of the next neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration is skipped, and control moves to the next iteration of the loop. `prev[nei]` is now set to `node`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `node` to `prev[nei]`. This means that `prev[nei]` now holds the value of `node`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
