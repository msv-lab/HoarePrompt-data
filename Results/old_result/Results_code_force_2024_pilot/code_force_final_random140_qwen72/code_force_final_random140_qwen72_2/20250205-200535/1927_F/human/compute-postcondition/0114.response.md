Output State: **`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the values of these neighbors during the loop iterations. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. `prev[nei]` is now set to `node`. `nei` is not in the `prev` set. `que` now includes `nei`.**
