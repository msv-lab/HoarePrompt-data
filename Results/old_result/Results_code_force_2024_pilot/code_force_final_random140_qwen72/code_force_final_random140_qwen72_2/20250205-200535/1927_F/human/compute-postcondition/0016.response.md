Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` now contains `v` and `u` (duplicated) and `v` is appended again, `graph[v]` now contains `u` (appended), `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**.
