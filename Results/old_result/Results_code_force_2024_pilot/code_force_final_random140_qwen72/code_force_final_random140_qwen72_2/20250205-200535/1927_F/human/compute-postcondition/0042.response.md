To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `parent_v` is the parent of `v` and `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`.
- `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `i` is `m-1`.
- `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`.
- `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the second tuple in `edges`.
- If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `start` remains set to -1, and `end` remains set to -1.
- In both cases, `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure.

### Loop Head:
```python
for (w, u, v) in edges:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the `edges` list.
- The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in `edges`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variables in the loop head are `w`, `u`, and `v`.
- These variables are set to the next tuple in `edges` at the start of each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the second tuple in `edges`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `w`, `u`, and `v` must be set to the values of the next tuple in `edges`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `w`, `u`, and `v` needs to be adjusted to the values of the next tuple in `edges`.

### Final State:
State: **`parent_v` is the parent of `v` and `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`; `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`; `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop; `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations; `i` is `m-1`; `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the third tuple in `edges`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `start` remains set to -1, and `end` remains set to -1. In both cases, `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure.**
