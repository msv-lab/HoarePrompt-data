To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `nei` and `graph[node]`.

1. **`graph[node]`**: This should be a collection (e.g., a list, set, or dictionary) that contains the neighbors of the current `node`. For the loop to execute, `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor (`nei`).

2. **`nei`**: This is the variable that will take on the values of the elements in `graph[node]` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be explicitly initialized before the loop, as it will be assigned values from `graph[node]`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `graph[node]` is not empty. The other variables mentioned in the state description (`prev`, `que`, `node`, and `end`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor.

State: **`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, `nei` will take on the values of these neighbors during the loop iterations**
