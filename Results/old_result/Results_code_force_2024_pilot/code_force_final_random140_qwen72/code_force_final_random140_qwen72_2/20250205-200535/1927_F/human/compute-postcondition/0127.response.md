Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `nei` will take on the value of the next (second) neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration.***
