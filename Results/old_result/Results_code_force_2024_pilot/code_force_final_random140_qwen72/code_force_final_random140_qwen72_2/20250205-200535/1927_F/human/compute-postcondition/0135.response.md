The loop condition is `curr != -1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `curr` must not be `-1`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `curr` is now equal to the predecessor of `end` as stored in the `prev` dictionary, and `end` must not be `-1`.

Since `curr` is already set to the predecessor of `end`, and `end` is not `-1`, `curr` should also not be `-1` for the loop to proceed. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is a list containing the `end` node. `curr` is now equal to the predecessor of `end` as stored in the `prev` dictionary, and `end` must not be `-1`.**
