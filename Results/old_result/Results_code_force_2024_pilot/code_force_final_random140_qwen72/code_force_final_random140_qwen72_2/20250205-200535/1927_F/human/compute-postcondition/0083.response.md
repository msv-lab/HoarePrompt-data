To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `nei` and `graph[node]`.

1. **`graph[node]`**: This must be a non-empty iterable for the loop to execute at least once. If `graph[node]` is empty, the loop will not run.
2. **`nei`**: This variable will take on the values from `graph[node]` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- All neighbors of `node` have been processed.
- For each neighbor `nei` of `node` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`.
- If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- The `que` contains all unvisited neighbors of `node` that were not previously in `prev`.
- The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited and their respective predecessors.
- `que` must contain at least one element.
- `node` is now the first element that was in `que` before the `popleft()` operation, and `que` no longer contains this element.
- If `node` is equal to `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `graph[node]` is non-empty. The other conditions mentioned in the initial state are not directly related to the loop head but are part of the broader context of the program.

State: **`graph[node]` must be a non-empty iterable, `nei` will take on the values from `graph[node]` during each iteration.**
