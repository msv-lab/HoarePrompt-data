Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` now contains `v` and `graph[v]` contains `u` and `u` (duplicated), `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**.

Explanation:
- The code `graph[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list `graph[v]`. Since `graph[v]` already contained `u`, `u` is now duplicated in `graph[v]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `w`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
