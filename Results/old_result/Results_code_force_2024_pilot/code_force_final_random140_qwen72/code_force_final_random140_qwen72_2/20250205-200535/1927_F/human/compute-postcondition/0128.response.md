Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `prev` will contain all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, and `que` will contain all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that were processed, except for the node that was just removed from the front of `que`. The variable `node` will hold the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If `node` is equal to `end`, the loop will terminate early.**

In natural language, this means:
- The dictionary `prev` will map each visited node to its predecessor in the path.
- The list `que` will store all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that have been processed, excluding the node that was just removed from the front of `que`.
- The variable `node` will hold the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`.
- If the last processed node (`node`) is equal to the `end` node, the loop will terminate early, indicating that the `end` node has been reached.
