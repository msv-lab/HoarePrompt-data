Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` handle input correctly. They read from standard input, process the input as required, and return the appropriate data types (integers, lists, etc.).

2. **Graph Construction**: In `func_6`, the graph is constructed correctly using a `defaultdict` and a list of edges. The edges are read and stored appropriately.

3. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is necessary for the algorithm to find the minimum weight cycle.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: The DSU structure is used correctly to manage connected components. The `find` and `union` operations are implemented properly.

5. **Cycle Detection**: The function correctly identifies cycles by checking if the endpoints of an edge belong to the same connected component. If they do, it records the edge weight and the endpoints.

6. **Path Reconstruction**: The function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to reconstruct the cycle path from the start to the end node. The path is stored in reverse order and then printed correctly.

7. **Output**: The function prints the minimum edge weight and the length of the cycle, followed by the nodes in the cycle in the correct order.

8. **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_7` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_6` for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
