The function `func_6` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5). The parameter `edges` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing three integers (w, u, v), where `w` represents the weight of the edge, and `u` and `v` represent the vertices connected by the edge, with the constraints 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the parameters and their constraints, it is reasonable to infer that the function likely processes a graph defined by `n` vertices and `m` edges, and performs some operation related to these edges and their weights.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`, where `n` and `m` are integers within specific bounds, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing weighted edges between vertices. The function processes this graph data but the specific output is not provided.**
