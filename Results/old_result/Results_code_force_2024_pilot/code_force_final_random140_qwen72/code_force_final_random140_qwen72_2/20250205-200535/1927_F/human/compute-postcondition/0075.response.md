The code snippet `prev[nei] = node` updates the `prev` dictionary by setting the value of the key `nei` to `node`. This means that `nei` now points back to `node` in the path being constructed.

Given the initial state:
- `node` is a key in `graph` with at least three neighbors.
- `nei` is the third neighbor in `graph[node]`.
- If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.

After executing the code:
- The value of `prev[nei]` is set to `node`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`node` is a key in `graph` with at least three neighbors, `nei` is the third neighbor in `graph[node]`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and if `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.**
