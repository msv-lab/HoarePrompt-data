Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` now contains `v` and `u` (duplicated) and `v` is appended again, `graph[v]` now contains `u` (appended), `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the tuple `(w, u, v)` to the list `edges`.
- The initial state already mentions that `edges` contains the tuple `(w, u, v)`, so after appending, `edges` will contain two instances of the tuple `(w, u, v)`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, but their specific values are not known.
- The structure of `graph` remains unchanged except for the addition of the new tuple to `edges`.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
