You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5), and edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where w is an integer representing the weight of the edge, and u, v are integers representing the vertices connected by the edge, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. The value of `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`. For each iteration, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    start = -1
    end = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            _min_edge = w
            start = u
            end = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. The value of `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`. A new instance of the `DSU` class is created with the size `n + 1` and assigned to the variable `dsu`. `_min_edge` is set to the smallest weight `w` of any edge `(w, u, v)` where `u` and `v` had the same parent before the union operation, or it remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`) if no such edge exists. `start` is set to the `u` value of the edge with the smallest `w` where `u` and `v` had the same parent, or it remains set to -1 if no such edge exists. `end` is set to the `v` value of the edge with the smallest `w` where `u` and `v` had the same parent, or it remains set to -1 if no such edge exists. All nodes `u` and `v` that were processed in the loop are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure.
    que = deque([start])
    prev = {start: -1}
    while que:
        node = que.popleft()
        
        if node == end:
            break
        
        for nei in graph[node]:
            if node == start and nei == end:
                continue
            if nei not in prev:
                prev[nei] = node
                que.append(nei)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty.
    path = []
    curr = end
    while curr != -1:
        path.append(curr)
        
        curr = prev[curr]
        
    #State: The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is a list containing the full path from the `end` node back to the `start` node, in reverse order. `curr` is now equal to `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed and the entire path has been reconstructed.
    print(_min_edge, len(path))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(path) (where _min_edge is the value of the minimum edge weight encountered, and len(path) is the number of nodes in the path from the end node back to the start node)
    print(*path[::-1])
    #This is printed: (nothing printed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`, where `n` and `m` are integers within specific bounds, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing weighted edges between vertices. The function processes this graph data but the specific output is not provided.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
