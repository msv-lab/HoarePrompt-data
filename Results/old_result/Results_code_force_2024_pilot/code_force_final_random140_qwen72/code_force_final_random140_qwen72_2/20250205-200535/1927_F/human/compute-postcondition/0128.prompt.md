Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *After all iterations of the loop, `prev` will contain all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, and `que` will contain all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that were processed, except for the node that was just removed from the front of `que`. The variable `node` now holds the value of the node that was at the front of `que`. If `node` is equal to `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the values of these neighbors during the loop iterations. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `nei` is added to `que`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the value of the next neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration is skipped. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is appended to `que`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`graph[node]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `nei` will take on the value of the next (second) neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
