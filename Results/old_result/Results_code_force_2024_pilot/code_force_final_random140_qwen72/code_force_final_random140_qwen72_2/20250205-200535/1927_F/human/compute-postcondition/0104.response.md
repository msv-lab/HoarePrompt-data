The only object in the loop head is `que`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `que`. If `que` is not empty (i.e., contains at least one element), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `que` will contain all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that were processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `que` must still contain at least one element.

State: **After all iterations of the loop, `prev` will contain all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, and `que` will contain all unvisited neighbors of the nodes that were processed. `que` must contain at least one element.**
