Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the values of these neighbors during the loop iterations. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `nei` is added to `que`.***
