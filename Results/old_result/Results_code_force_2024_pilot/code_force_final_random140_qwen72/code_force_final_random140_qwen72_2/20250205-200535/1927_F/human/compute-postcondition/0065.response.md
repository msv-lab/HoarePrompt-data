Postcondition: ***`node` is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in the `prev` set, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
