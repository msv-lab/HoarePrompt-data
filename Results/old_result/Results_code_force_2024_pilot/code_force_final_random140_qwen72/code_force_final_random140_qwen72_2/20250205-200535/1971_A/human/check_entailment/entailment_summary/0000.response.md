Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers for multiple test cases. However, there is a critical mistake in the program: it prints the maximum value before the minimum value, which is the opposite of what the problem statement requires. The problem statement clearly states that the output should be the minimum of `x` and `y`, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

Given this, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
