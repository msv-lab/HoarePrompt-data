Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are new input integers.
- The conditions for `a` and `b` are:
  - If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition `a > b` holds true.
  - If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition `a == b` holds true.
  - If `a` is less than `b`, the condition `a < b` holds true.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a, ' ', b)
```

This statement will print the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can only describe their relationship based on the conditions provided.

Output: **a, ' ', b (where a and b are the input integers, and a can be greater than, equal to, or less than b)**
