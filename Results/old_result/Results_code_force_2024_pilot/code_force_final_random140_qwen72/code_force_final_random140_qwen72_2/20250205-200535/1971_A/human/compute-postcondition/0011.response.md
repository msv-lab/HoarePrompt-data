Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` must have been at least as large as the number of times the loop ran. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't change. For each iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the user, and these values are used to print the maximum and minimum of the two numbers.
