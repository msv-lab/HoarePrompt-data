Based on the initial state:

- `t` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- The conditions for `a` and `b` are:
  - If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition `a > b` holds true.
  - If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the condition `a <= b` holds true.
  - If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition `a == b` holds true.
  - Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`.

The print statement is:
```
print(b, ' ', a)
```

This statement will print the value of `b`, followed by a space, and then the value of `a`.

Since the values of `a` and `b` are not explicitly defined, we can only describe them based on the conditions provided. The values of `a` and `b` can be any integers, but their relationship is described by the conditions.

Output: **b, ' ', a (where b and a are the input integers, and their relationship is described by the conditions provided)**
