Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 100`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (both between 0 and 9). It then prints the maximum and minimum of these two integers. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the maximum and minimum of the two input integers have been printed.
