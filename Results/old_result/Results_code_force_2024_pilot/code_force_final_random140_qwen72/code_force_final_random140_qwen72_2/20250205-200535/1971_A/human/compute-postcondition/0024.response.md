Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `a` and `b` are new input integers
- If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition `a > b` holds true
- If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition `a == b` holds true
- If `a` is less than `b`, the condition `a < b` holds true

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b, ' ', a)
```

This statement will print the value of `b`, followed by a space, and then the value of `a`.

Since the values of `a` and `b` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, they can be any integers. The conditions provided (`a > b`, `a == b`, `a < b`) only describe the relationship between `a` and `b`, but do not specify their exact values.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **b, ' ', a (where b and a are the values of the input integers b and a, respectively)**
