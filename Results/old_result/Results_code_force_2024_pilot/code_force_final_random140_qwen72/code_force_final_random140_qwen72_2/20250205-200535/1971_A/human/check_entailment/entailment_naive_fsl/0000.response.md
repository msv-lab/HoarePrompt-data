Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program prints the maximum of `a` and `b` first, followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, according to the problem description, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input: `1 9`
- Expected Output: `1 9`
- Actual Output: `9 1`

This example shows that the program does not produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.
