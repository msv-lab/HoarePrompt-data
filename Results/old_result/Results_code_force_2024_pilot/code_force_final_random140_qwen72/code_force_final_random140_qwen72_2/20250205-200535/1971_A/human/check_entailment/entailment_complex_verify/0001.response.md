Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` starts by reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, processing each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input using `input().split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
4. The program then prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

However, according to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. The current implementation prints the maximum first and the minimum second, which is incorrect.

The annotated code confirms that the function correctly processes the input and performs the necessary operations, but the order of the output is reversed. This is a clear discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the mistake in the order of the printed values.

Final: **False**
