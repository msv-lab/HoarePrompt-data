The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning these integers to `a` and `b`.

- `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment.
- `a` and `b` are now assigned the values of the two integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.**
