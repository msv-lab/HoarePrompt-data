Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, processing each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input using `input().split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
4. However, the program prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The problem requires the minimum to be printed first, followed by the maximum.

The original assessment correctly identified this issue and provided a corrected version of the program. The original program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to the incorrect order of printing the results.

Final: **False**
