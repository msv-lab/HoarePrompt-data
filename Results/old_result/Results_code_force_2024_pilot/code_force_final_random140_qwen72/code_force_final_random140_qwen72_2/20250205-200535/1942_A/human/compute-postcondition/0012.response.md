The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts using space as a delimiter, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The input must be a positive integer within the range specified by `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is 1.**
