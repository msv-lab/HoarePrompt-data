Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program fails to handle the case where \( k > 1 \) and \( k < n \). According to the problem description, the program should output an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. However, the program only handles the cases where \( n = k \) or \( k = 1 \), and outputs `-1` for all other cases. This is incorrect because there are valid arrays that can satisfy the condition for \( k > 1 \) and \( k < n \).

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2
```
The program will output `-1`, but a valid output could be:
```
1 2 1
```
This array has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
