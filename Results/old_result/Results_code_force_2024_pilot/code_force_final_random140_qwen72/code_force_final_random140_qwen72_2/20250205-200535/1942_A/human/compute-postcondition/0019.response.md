The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^3, and `_` is 2. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, while the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is 2.**
