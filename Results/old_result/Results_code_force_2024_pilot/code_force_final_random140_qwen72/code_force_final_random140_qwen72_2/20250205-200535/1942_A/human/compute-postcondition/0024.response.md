Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is 2. If `n` equals `k`, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `k` is 1, the program also behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.***
