Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `_` is 0.
- The input must be a positive integer where \(1 \leq \text{int(input())} \leq t\).
- Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `k` is not equal to 1.

Given the Python code snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

The `print` statement simply prints the integer `-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-1**
