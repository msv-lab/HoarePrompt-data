Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `_` is 1. If `n` equals `k`, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part, which in this case is identical to the if part. Therefore, regardless of the value of `k`, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` retain their initial values and constraints.***
