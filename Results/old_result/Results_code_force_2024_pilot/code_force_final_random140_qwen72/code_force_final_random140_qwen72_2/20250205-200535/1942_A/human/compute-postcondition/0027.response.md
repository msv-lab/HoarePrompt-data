Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each test case and prints a specific output based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `n` equals `k`, it prints a sequence of `1`s repeated `n` times. If `k` is 1, it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. If neither condition is met, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed outputs. **
