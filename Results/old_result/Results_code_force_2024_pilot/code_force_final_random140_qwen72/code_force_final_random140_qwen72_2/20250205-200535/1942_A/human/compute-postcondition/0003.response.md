Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `_` is 0.
- The input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ t).
- Additionally, `n` is equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n` and `k`:**
   - According to the initial state, `n` is equal to `k`.
   - Both `n` and `k` are integers within the range \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3\).

2. **String Construction:**
   - The expression `'1 ' * n` creates a string consisting of the character `'1 '` repeated `n` times.
   - For example, if `n = 3`, the string would be `'1 1 1 '`.

3. **Removing the Last Character:**
   - The expression `[:-1]` removes the last character from the string.
   - Continuing the example, if the string is `'1 1 1 '`, removing the last character results in `'1 1 1'`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'1 ' * n` with the last space removed.
   - Since `n` is equal to `k`, the output will be a sequence of `n` ones separated by spaces, with no trailing space.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output a string of `n` ones separated by spaces, without a trailing space.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (where there are n ones, and n is the value of n)**
