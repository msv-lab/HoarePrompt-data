You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is `t-1`. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the conditions within the loop were evaluated based on the values of `n` and `k` provided for that specific test case. If `n` was equal to `k`, the output was a sequence of `1`s repeated `n` times. If `k` was 1, the output was a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. If neither condition was met, the output was `-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` for each test case remain as they were initially provided, and the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `t-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each test case and prints a specific output based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `n` equals `k`, it prints a sequence of `1`s repeated `n` times. If `k` is 1, it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. If neither condition is met, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed outputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**:
   - If \( n = k \), the array can be constructed with all elements being the same (e.g., all 1s). This ensures that every cyclic shift is sorted because all elements are equal.
   - The output `('1 ' * n)[:-1]` generates a string of `n` ones separated by spaces, which is correct.

3. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), the array can be constructed such that only one cyclic shift is sorted. One way to achieve this is to create an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order except for the last element, which is smaller than the first element.
   - The output `print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))` generates an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).

4. **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**:
   - If \( 1 < k < n \), it is impossible to construct an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. This is because having more than one sorted cyclic shift implies a specific pattern that cannot be achieved without violating the constraints of the problem.
   - The output `print(-1)` correctly indicates that no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified cases and outputs the appropriate results. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
