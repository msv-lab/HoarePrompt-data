Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- `_` is 1.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-1**
