Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is `t-1`. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the conditions within the loop were evaluated based on the values of `n` and `k` provided for that specific test case. If `n` was equal to `k`, the output was a sequence of `1`s repeated `n` times. If `k` was 1, the output was a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. If neither condition was met, the output was `-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` for each test case remain as they were initially provided, and the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `t-1`.**
