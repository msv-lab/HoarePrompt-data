The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and it is being used in the context of a `range` function call with the result of `int(input())`. This means that the loop will iterate a number of times equal to the integer value provided by the user input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and the loop is iterating based on the input value. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` should increment by 1, but since `_` is just a placeholder and its value is not checked (it's a common Python idiom to use `_` when the loop variable is not needed), the actual state that needs to be considered is the remaining iterations count, which is implicitly managed by the `range`.

However, since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and `_` is the only object in the loop head, we can infer that the state of `_` does not need to be explicitly stated beyond recognizing that it will take on the next value in the sequence generated by `range`.

Given that the loop is set up to run a fixed number of times determined by the input, and assuming the input remains unchanged between iterations (which is a reasonable assumption since the input is typically provided before the loop starts and is not modified within the loop), the state of the loop at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `_` is 2. The loop will continue to execute until `_` reaches the value specified by the input.** 

Note: The actual value of `_` (whether it is 2, 3, etc.) is not important for the loop's execution, but for the sake of adhering to the task, we acknowledge that it increments with each iteration.
