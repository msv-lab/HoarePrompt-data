Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers from input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` to integers. The other variables (`b`, `t`, `T`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The new values of `n` and `m` are now integers, and the rest of the initial state remains valid.
