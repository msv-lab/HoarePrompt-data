The function `func` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The output description is missing, but typically, functions with such constraints might perform some operation involving these parameters and return a result.

Since the specific output is not provided, I'll assume a generic functionality based on common operations with such parameters (e.g., mathematical operations, calculations, etc.).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. It performs an unspecified operation using these parameters and returns a result based on that operation.**
