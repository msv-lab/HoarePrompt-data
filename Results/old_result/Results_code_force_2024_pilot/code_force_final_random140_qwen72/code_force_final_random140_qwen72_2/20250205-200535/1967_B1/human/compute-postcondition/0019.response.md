The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `n // b + 1` to its current value. Given that `ans` is initially 0, `b` is 1, and `n` is an integer, the expression simplifies to `n // 1 + 1`, which is simply `n + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string inputs such that `min(n, m)` is at least 1, `b` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + 1`**
