You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then calculates a value `ans` by summing up `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. Finally, it prints the calculated `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 for each test case, which is correct.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. This is incorrect because the problem requires checking all values of `b` from 1 to `m`, not just up to `min(n, m)`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The program adds `n // b + 1` to `ans` for each `b`. This is incorrect because it does not check the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, but the value of `ans` is not computed correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
4. If the condition is satisfied, increment the count.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of `n` and `m`. A more efficient approach involves using properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and number theory to reduce the complexity.

Here is a more efficient approach:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This approach checks the condition for each pair `(a, b)` and increments the count if the condition is satisfied. However, this is still not the most efficient solution, but it is closer to the correct logic. Further optimization can be done using number theory properties.
