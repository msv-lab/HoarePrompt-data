Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `b = 1` to `b = min(n, m)`. After the loop completes, `b` will be `min(n, m) + 1`.
- The variable `ans` accumulates the value of `n // b + 1` for each iteration of `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
- The final value of `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
- The variables `t` and `T` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
