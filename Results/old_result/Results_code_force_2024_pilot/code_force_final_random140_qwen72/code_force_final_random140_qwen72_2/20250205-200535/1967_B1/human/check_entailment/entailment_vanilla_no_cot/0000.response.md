Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is flawed. The program incorrectly adds `n // b + 1` to the answer for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. This does not account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to iterate over possible values of `a` and `b` and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. The current implementation does not perform this check and thus produces incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This version correctly checks the condition for each pair `(a, b)` and counts the valid pairs. However, it may not be efficient enough for large inputs due to the nested loops. For better performance, you might need to optimize the solution further.
