Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string inputs, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` to integers. The rest of the variables (`b`, `t`, `T`, and `ans`) remain unchanged, but now `b` is calculated based on the new integer values of `n` and `m`.
