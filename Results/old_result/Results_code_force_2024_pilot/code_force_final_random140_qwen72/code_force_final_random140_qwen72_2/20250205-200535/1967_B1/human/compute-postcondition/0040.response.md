Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then calculates a value `ans` by summing up `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. Finally, it prints the calculated `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
