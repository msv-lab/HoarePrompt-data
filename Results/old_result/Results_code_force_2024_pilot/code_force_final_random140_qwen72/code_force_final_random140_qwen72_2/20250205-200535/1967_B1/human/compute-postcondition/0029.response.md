The code snippet sets `ans` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `ans`, which was the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, and `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers from input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `ans` is 0**
