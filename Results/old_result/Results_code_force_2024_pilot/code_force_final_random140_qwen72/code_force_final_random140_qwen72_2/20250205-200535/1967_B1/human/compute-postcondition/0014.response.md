The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `T` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is 0 and `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `T`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`**
