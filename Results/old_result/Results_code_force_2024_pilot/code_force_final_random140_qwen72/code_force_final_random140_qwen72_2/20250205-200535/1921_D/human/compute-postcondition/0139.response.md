Postcondition: **Given `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. After the if-else block executes, if `dif1 > dif2`, then: if `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2 - 1]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2 - 1`. If `dif3 ≤ dif4`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 ≤ dif2`, then: if `dif3 > dif4`, and if `dif3 > dif2`, `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b1 - 1]`, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b2` is decremented by 1. If `dif3 ≤ dif4`, and if `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2 - 1]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` is increased by 1.**
