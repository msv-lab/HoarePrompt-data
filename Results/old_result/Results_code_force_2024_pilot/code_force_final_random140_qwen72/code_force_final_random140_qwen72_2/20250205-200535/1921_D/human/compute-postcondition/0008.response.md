Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a2` is set to `n - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`) retain their initial values and conditions.
