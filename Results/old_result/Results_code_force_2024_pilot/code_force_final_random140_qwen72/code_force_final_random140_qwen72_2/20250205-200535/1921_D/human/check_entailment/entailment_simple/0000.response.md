### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum total difference \( D \) between Petya's array \( a \) and Vasya's array \( c \), where \( c \) is formed by selecting \( n \) elements from \( b \) and arranging them in any order.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: Both arrays \( a \) and \( b \) are sorted. Sorting is crucial because it allows us to consider the largest and smallest possible differences efficiently.
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The program uses a two-pointer technique to select elements from \( b \) that maximize the absolute difference with elements in \( a \). The pointers `a1` and `a2` traverse \( a \) from both ends, while `b1` and `b2` traverse \( b \) from both ends.
4. **Difference Calculation**: The program calculates four possible differences for each pair of elements from \( a \) and \( b \) and selects the maximum difference to add to the total sum \( ans \).
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when all elements in \( b \) are the same (as in the second test case).

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The program correctly sorts both arrays, which is essential for the two-pointer approach.
  - The two-pointer technique ensures that the maximum possible difference is considered at each step.
  - The program correctly updates the pointers and accumulates the maximum differences.
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program handles cases where \( b \) has repeated elements or where \( b \) is already sorted.
  - The program also handles the case where \( n = m \) and \( n < m \).

#### Potential Issues:
- **Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is \( O(t \cdot (n \log n + m \log m)) \), which is efficient given the constraints.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and handles all the requirements and edge cases specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
