The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` will be greater than `a2`
- `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences
- `b1` and `b2` will reflect the positions in the list `b` used in the calculations
- `t` is now `t - 1`
- `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` are updated with the new values provided by the user input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a1` is greater than `a2`, `ans` contains the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences, `b1` and `b2` reflect the positions in the list `b` used in the calculations, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
