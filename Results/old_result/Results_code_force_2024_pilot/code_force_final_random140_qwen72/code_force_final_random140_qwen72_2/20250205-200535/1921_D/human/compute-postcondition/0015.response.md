The code calculates the absolute difference between the first elements of the lists `a` and `b`, and assigns this value to the variable `dif1`.

- `a1` is 0, so `a[a1]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
- `b1` is 0, so `b[b1]` refers to the first element of the list `b`.
- `dif1` is assigned the value `abs(a[0] - b[0])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`.**
