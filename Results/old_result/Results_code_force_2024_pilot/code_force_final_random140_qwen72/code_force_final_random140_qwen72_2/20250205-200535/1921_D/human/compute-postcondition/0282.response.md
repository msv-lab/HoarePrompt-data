The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`a1` is equal to `a2 + 1`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `b1` is equal to `b2 + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or less, `b2` is `m - 1` or less, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `t` must be greater than 0**
