Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5), followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). The function calculates the maximum absolute difference between elements of `a` and `b` in a way that maximizes the sum of these differences. After processing all test cases, it prints the accumulated sum of these maximum differences for each test case. The original values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` for each test case remain unchanged. **
