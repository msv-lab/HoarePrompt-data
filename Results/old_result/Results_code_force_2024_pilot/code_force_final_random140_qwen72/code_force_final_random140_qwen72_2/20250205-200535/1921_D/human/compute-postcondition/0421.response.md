Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `a1` will be greater than `a2`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during each iteration of the loop for each test case. The indices `b1` and `b2` will reflect the positions in the list `b` that were used in the calculations, but they may not necessarily cover all elements of `b` depending on the specific values and the sequence of operations performed. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` for each test case will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
