Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, and `dif3` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`; `dif2` is now equal to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `dif2` to be the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
