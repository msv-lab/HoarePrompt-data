Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. If `dif1 > dif2`, then if `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`, and `b2` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `a1` is incremented by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then if `dif3 > dif1`, `b1` is incremented by 1, `a2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`. Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`. If `dif1 <= dif2`, then if `dif3 > dif4`, `b1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, and `a2` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is incremented by `dif4`, `a2` is decremented by 1, and `b2` is decremented by 1. If neither of these conditions hold, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a1+1] - b[b2-1])`, and `a1` is incremented by 1 while `b2` is decremented by 1.**
