Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is 0, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is 0, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a1` is 0 or 1, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `b1` is 0 or 1, `b2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`. If `dif1` > `dif2`, then `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif1` <= `dif2`, then `ans` is the minimum of `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a1` is 0 or 1, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus either `dif3` or `dif4` depending on the condition `dif3 > dif4`. `b1` is 0 or 1, `b2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2` (or `m - 2` or `m - 3` if `dif3 > dif4`), `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (or `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `dif3 > dif4`), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a1]` and the element `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a1]` and the element `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a2]` and the element `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a2]` and the element `b[b2]`. If `dif1` > `dif2`, then `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus `dif3` if `dif3 > dif4` or plus `dif4` otherwise. If `dif1` <= `dif2`, then `ans` is the minimum of `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus `dif3` if `dif3 > dif4` or plus `dif4` otherwise.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a1` is 0 or 1, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus either `dif3` or `dif4` depending on the condition `dif3 > dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, `ans` is further incremented by `dif1` if `dif1 > dif3` and `dif1 > dif4`, or by `dif3` if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif1`, or by `dif4` if `dif4 > dif1` and `dif4 > dif3`. If `dif1 <= dif2`, `ans` is further incremented by `dif2` if `dif2 > dif3` and `dif2 > dif4`, or by `dif3` if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif2`, or by `dif4` if `dif4 > dif2` and `dif4 > dif3`. In all cases, `b1` is 0 or 1, `b2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2` (or `m - 2` or `m - 3` if `dif3 > dif4`), `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (or `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `dif3 > dif4`), and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
