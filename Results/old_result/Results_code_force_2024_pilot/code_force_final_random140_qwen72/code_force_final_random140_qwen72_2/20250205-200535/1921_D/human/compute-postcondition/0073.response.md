Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `b1` and `b2` are as set in the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`, `a2` is `a2 - 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1. This affects the values of `dif3` and `dif4` because they depend on `a2`. The new `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])` and the new `dif4` is `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`. The condition `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1` is updated accordingly. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
