Output State: **After the loop has completed all its iterations, `a1` will be greater than `a2`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. The indices `b1` and `b2` will reflect the positions in the list `b` that were used in the calculations, but they may not necessarily cover all elements of `b` depending on the specific values and the sequence of operations performed. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**

This means that the loop has processed all elements in the list `a` by comparing them with appropriate elements in the list `b` and accumulating the maximum absolute differences into `ans`. The indices `a1` and `a2` will no longer satisfy the condition `a1 <= a2`, which is why the loop terminates. The final value of `ans` represents the total sum of the maximum absolute differences found during the entire process. The lists `a` and `b` and the input parameters `t`, `n`, and `m` remain as they were initially defined.
