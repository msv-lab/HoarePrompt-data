Output State: **`a1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1`, `b2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` is `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`.**

Explanation:
- `b2` is decremented by 1.
- The values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged except for the changes already mentioned in the initial state.
