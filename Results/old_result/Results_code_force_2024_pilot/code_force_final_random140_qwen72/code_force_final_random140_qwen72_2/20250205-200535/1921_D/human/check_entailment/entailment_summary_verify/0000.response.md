### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible total difference \( D \) between two arrays \( a \) and \( c \), where \( c \) is constructed from a subset of \( b \) and arranged to maximize \( D \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \), and the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It sorts both arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It then iterates through the sorted arrays, calculating the differences between elements of \( a \) and the smallest and largest elements of \( b \) that have not been used yet.
   - The function selects the maximum difference at each step and updates the indices accordingly.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting both arrays is a crucial step because it allows the function to efficiently find the maximum possible differences.
   - **Difference Calculation**: The function calculates four possible differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) at each step:
     - `dif1`: Difference between the smallest element of \( a \) and the smallest element of \( b \).
     - `dif2`: Difference between the smallest element of \( a \) and the largest element of \( b \).
     - `dif3`: Difference between the largest element of \( a \) and the smallest element of \( b \).
     - `dif4`: Difference between the largest element of \( a \) and the largest element of \( b \).
   - **Selection of Maximum Difference**: The function selects the maximum of these four differences and updates the indices of \( a \) and \( b \) accordingly. This ensures that the maximum possible difference is always chosen at each step.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Equal Elements**: If all elements in \( b \) are the same, the function will correctly handle this by selecting the same element for all differences.
   - **Different Lengths**: The function handles the case where \( m \) is greater than \( n \) by only using \( n \) elements from \( b \).

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \( O(n \log n + m \log m) \) due to the sorting steps, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \) between the arrays \( a \) and \( c \). The function handles all edge cases and ensures that the maximum possible difference is always selected at each step. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
