Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, and assigns this value to `dif2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
