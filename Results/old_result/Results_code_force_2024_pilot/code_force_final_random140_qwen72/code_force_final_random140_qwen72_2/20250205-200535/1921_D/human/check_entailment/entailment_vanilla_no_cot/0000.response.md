Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, sorts the arrays `a` and `b`, and then iteratively selects elements from `b` to maximize the total difference `D`. The logic for choosing the best element from `b` to pair with each element in `a` is complex but seems to cover all necessary cases to ensure the maximum difference is achieved. The program also handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, based on the provided information, the program is correct.
