The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif2`. All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` and `a2` ensure `a1 <= a2`; `dif4` is equal to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `ans` is increased by `dif2`; `b1`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, and `dif3` remain unchanged.**
