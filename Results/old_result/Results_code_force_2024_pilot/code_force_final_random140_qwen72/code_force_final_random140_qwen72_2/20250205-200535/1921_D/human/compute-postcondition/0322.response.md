Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are as follows: `a` and `b` are sorted lists of integers from the new input, `n` and `m` are updated with new input values (both must be greater than or equal to 1), `t` is `t - 2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, and `dif1` is greater than `dif2`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `dif3`, `b1` is 1, and `b2` is `m - 1`. Otherwise, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `dif4`, `b1` is 0, and `b2` is `m - 2`. If `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, then `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `b1` is 1, and `b2` is `m - 1`.***
