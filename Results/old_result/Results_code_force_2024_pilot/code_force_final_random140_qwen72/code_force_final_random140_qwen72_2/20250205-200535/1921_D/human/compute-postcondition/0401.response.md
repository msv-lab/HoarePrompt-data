Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`. If `dif4 > dif1`, then `a1` and `a2` are updated to `a2 - 1`, `b1` and `b2` are updated to `b2 - 1`, and `ans` is incremented by `dif4`. Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by `dif1`.***
