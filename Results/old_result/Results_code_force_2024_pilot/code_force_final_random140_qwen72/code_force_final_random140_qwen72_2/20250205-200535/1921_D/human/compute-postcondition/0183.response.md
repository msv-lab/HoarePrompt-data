Postcondition: **`a1` is 0 or 1, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is either `dif3`, `dif4`, or `dif1`, `b1` is 0, 1, or remains unchanged, `b2` is `m - 1`, `m - 2`, or remains unchanged, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and `dif1` is greater than `dif2`. If `dif3` > `dif4`, then `ans` is `dif3` if `dif3` > `dif1`, otherwise `ans` is `dif1`. If `dif3` <= `dif4`, then `ans` is `dif4` if `dif4` > `dif1`, otherwise `ans` is `dif1`.**
