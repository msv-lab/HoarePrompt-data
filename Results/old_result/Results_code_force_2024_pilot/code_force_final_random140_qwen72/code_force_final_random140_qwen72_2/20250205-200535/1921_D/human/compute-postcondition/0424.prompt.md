You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

        #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `a1` will be greater than `a2`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during each iteration of the loop for each test case. The indices `b1` and `b2` will reflect the positions in the list `b` that were used in the calculations, but they may not necessarily cover all elements of `b` depending on the specific values and the sequence of operations performed. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` for each test case will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `a1` will be greater than `a2`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during each iteration of the loop for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
