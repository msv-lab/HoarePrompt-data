Output State: **`a1` is greater than `a2`, `ans` contains the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences, `b1` and `b2` reflect the positions in the list `b` used in the calculations, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is now a list of integers from the new input.** 

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. This changes the value of `b` to a new list of integers. All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `ans`, `b1`, `b2`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`) remain unchanged.
