The code snippet `a2 -= 1` decrements the value of `a2` by 1. Given the initial state, `a2` is initially `n - 1`. After decrementing, `a2` becomes `n - 2`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `dif3`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` is updated with a new input value (and must be greater than or equal to 1), `m` is updated with a new input value (and must be greater than or equal to 1), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, `dif3` is greater than `dif1`.**
