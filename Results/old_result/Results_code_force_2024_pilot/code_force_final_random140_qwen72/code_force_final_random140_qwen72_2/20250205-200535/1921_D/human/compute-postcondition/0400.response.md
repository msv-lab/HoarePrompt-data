Output State: **`a1` is `a1 + 1`, `a2` ensures `a1 <= a2`, `b1` is `b1 + 1`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4` remain as described, and `ans` is `ans + dif1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b1` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
