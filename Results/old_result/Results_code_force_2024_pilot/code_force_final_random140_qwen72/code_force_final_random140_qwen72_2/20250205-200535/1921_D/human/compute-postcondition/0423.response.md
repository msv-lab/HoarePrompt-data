The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `m`: Two integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, representing the lengths of two lists.
  - `a_i`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `b_i`: A list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information. Assuming the function returns some form of result for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
