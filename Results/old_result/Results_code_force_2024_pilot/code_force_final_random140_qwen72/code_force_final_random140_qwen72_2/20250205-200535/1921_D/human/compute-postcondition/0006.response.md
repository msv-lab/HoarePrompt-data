The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, representing the number of remaining test cases.
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, read from user input.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers read from user input.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` is now a list of integers read from the user input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers read from user input.**
