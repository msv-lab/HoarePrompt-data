Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`. If `dif3 > dif4`, then: if `dif3 > dif2`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`; otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then: if `dif4 > dif2`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are each decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`, and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`; otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2` ensures `a1 <= a2`, `b1` and `b2` are each decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`.***
