### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted. Sorting is a crucial step because it allows us to consider the largest and smallest elements in both arrays to maximize the absolute differences.

3. **Two-Pointer Approach**: The program uses a two-pointer approach to iterate through the sorted arrays `a` and `b`. The pointers `a1` and `a2` are used to traverse array `a` from both ends, while `b1` and `b2` are used to traverse array `b` from both ends.

4. **Maximizing Differences**: For each element in array `a`, the program calculates four possible differences:
   - `dif1`: Difference between the current element in `a` (from the start) and the smallest element in `b`.
   - `dif2`: Difference between the current element in `a` (from the start) and the largest element in `b`.
   - `dif3`: Difference between the current element in `a` (from the end) and the smallest element in `b`.
   - `dif4`: Difference between the current element in `a` (from the end) and the largest element in `b`.

5. **Choosing the Maximum Difference**: The program then selects the maximum of these four differences and adds it to the total difference `ans`. It updates the pointers accordingly to ensure that the next comparison is made with the next elements in the arrays.

6. **Output**: After processing all elements in array `a`, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: The program initializes `t` to the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
- **Sorting**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted, ensuring that the elements are in non-decreasing order.
- **Two-Pointer Logic**: The program uses a while loop to process elements from both ends of the sorted arrays `a` and `b`. It calculates the four possible differences and selects the maximum one to add to `ans`.
- **Pointer Updates**: The pointers `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are updated based on the selected difference to ensure that the next comparison is made with the next elements in the arrays.
- **Final State**: After processing all elements in array `a`, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The program follows a logical and efficient approach to solve the problem. It correctly handles the input, sorts the arrays, and uses a two-pointer technique to maximize the total difference. The logic for choosing the maximum difference and updating the pointers is sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: **True**
