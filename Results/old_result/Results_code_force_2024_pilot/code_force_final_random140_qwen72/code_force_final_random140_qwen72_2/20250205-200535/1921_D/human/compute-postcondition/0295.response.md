The code snippet `dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements at the indices `a1` and `b1` of the lists `a` and `b`, respectively, and assigns this value to the variable `dif1`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is 0
- `a2` is `n - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- `b1` is 0
- `b2` is `m - 1`
- `t` is `t - 2`
- `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input
- `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input
- `n` is updated with a new input value
- `m` is updated with a new input value
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `t` must be greater than 0

After executing the code snippet, the value of `dif1` is calculated as the absolute difference between the first elements of the lists `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` is updated with a new input value, `m` is updated with a new input value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`.**
