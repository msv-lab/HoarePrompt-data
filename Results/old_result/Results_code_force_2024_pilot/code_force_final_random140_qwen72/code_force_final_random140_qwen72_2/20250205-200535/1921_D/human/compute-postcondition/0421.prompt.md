Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module, i.e., it is being run directly and not imported as a module.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a1 = 0
    a2 = n - 1
    b1 = 0
    b2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    b.sort()
    a.sort()
    while a1 <= a2:
        dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
        dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
        dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
        dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
        if dif1 > dif2:
            if dif3 > dif4:
                if dif3 > dif1:
                    ans += dif3
                    a2 -= 1
                    b1 += 1
                else:
                    ans += dif1
                    a1 += 1
                    b1 += 1
            elif dif4 > dif1:
                ans += dif4
                a2 -= 1
                b2 -= 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif2:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif2
                a1 += 1
                b2 -= 1
        elif dif4 > dif2:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `a1` will be greater than `a2`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. The indices `b1` and `b2` will reflect the positions in the list `b` that were used in the calculations, but they may not necessarily cover all elements of `b` depending on the specific values and the sequence of operations performed. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a1` is equal to `a2 + 1`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `b1` is equal to `b2 + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or less, `b2` is `m - 1` or less, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final state will be as follows: `a1` will be greater than `a2`, indicating the loop condition `a1 <= a2` is no longer satisfied. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of the maximum differences selected during each iteration of the loop. The indices `b1` and `b2` will reflect the changes made during the loop's execution, typically moving towards the center of the `b` list. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
