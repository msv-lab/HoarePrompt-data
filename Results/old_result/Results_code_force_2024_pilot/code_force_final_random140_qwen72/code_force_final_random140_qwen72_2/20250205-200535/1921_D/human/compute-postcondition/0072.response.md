The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif3`. Since `dif3` is defined as `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, the new value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` and `b2` are as set in the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`.**
