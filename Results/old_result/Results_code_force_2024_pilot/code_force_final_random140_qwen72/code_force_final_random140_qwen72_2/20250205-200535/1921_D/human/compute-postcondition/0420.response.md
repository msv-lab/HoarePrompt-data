To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a1` will be greater than `a2` after the loop has executed all its iterations, meaning the loop condition `a1 <= a2` is no longer satisfied.
   - `ans` contains the sum of the maximum differences selected during each iteration of the loop.
   - `b1` and `b2` have been updated during the loop's execution, typically moving towards the center of the `b` list.
   - The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial values.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences selected during each iteration of the loop.
   - Since the exact values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, we know that `ans` is the result of the loop's operations, which involves selecting and summing the maximum differences.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum differences selected during the loop's execution.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum differences selected during the loop's execution)**
