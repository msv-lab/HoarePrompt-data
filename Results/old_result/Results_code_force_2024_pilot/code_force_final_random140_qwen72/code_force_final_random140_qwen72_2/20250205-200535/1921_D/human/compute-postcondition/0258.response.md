Output State: **`a1` is 0 or 1, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus either `dif3` or `dif4` depending on the condition `dif3 > dif4`, plus `dif4`. `b1` is 0 or 1, `b2` is `m - 2` or `m - 3` (or `m - 3` or `m - 4` if `dif3 > dif4`), `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` (or `n - 3` or `n - 4` if `dif3 > dif4`), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a1]` and the element `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a1]` and the element `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a2]` and the element `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a2]` and the element `b[b2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `b2` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The specific values of `b2` depend on its initial value, which could be `m - 1` or `m - 2` (or `m - 2` or `m - 3` if `dif3 > dif4`). After decrementing, `b2` is now `m - 2` or `m - 3` (or `m - 3` or `m - 4` if `dif3 > dif4`).
