Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their initial properties as described in the precondition. If `dif4` > `dif2`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`. Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is `dif2`. In both cases, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, `t` is `t - 2`, and the relationships between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.***
