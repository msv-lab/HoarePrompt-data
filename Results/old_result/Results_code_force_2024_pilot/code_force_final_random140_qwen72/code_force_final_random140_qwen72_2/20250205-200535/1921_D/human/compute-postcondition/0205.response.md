Postcondition: **`a1` is 0 or 1, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is the minimum of `dif2` and `dif3` or `dif4`, `b1` is 0 or 1, `b2` is `m - 2` or `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`. If `dif3` > `dif4`, then `ans` is `dif3`, `b1` is 1, and `b2` is `m - 1`, and `a2` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `dif4` and `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`.**
