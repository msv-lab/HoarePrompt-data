To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `a1 <= a2`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `a1 <= a2`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `a1` and `a2` are such that `a1 <= a2`.

### Adjustments:
- The only way the loop condition `a1 <= a2` can fail is if `a1` becomes greater than `a2`.
- Since the loop body modifies `a1` and `a2` in various ways (e.g., increasing `a1` or decreasing `a2`), we need to ensure that after these modifications, `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2`.

### Conclusion:
- If `a1` and `a2` were modified in such a way that `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2`, no further adjustment is needed.
- If the modifications result in `a1` being greater than `a2`, the loop will not execute again, and we cannot adjust `a1` or `a2` to change this because they are the only variables in the loop head.

Given that the problem statement does not provide specific values for `a1` and `a2` after the previous iteration, we assume that the loop body has already ensured that `a1 <= a2` remains true.

### Final State:
State: **`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`.**
