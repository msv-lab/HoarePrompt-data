Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`. If `dif3 > dif4`, then: if `dif3 > dif2`, `a1` and `a2` are decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then: if `dif4 > dif2`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are each decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the value of `dif4`. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are each decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`. In all cases, `dif4` is now equal to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.***
