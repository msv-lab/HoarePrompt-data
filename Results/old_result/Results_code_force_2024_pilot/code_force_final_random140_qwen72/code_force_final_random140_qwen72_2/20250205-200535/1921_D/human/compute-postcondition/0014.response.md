To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

- The loop condition is `a1 <= a2`.
- Before the loop, `a1` is 0 and `a2` is `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `a1 <= a2` must be true. Given that `a1` is 0, the condition simplifies to `0 <= a2`. Since `a2` is `n - 1`, the condition further simplifies to `0 <= n - 1`.

Given the constraints:
- `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5`

We know that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `n - 1` is at least 0, which means `a2` (which is `n - 1`) is always non-negative. This ensures that `0 <= a2` is always true.

Since the condition `a1 <= a2` is already satisfied with the given values, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0**
