Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.** 

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, which is stored in `dif4`. All other variables retain their initial values.
