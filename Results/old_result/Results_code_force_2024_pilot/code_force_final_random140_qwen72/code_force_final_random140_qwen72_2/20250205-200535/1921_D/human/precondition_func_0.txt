t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
