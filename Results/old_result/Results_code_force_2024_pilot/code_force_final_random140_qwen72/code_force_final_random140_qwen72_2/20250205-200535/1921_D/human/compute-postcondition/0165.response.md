The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is `dif3`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif4`.**
