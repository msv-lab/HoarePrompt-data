Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` and `b2` are as set in the if-else block, and `ans` is as set in the if-else block.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dif1` is updated to `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
