The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, after decrementing, the new value of `t` is `t - 1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, representing the number of remaining test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module.**
