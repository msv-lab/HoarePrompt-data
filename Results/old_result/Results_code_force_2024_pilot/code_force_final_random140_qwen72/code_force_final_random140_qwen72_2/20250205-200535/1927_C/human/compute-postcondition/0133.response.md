Postcondition: ***After the loop executes all iterations, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` has been incremented by `leftOnes` and remains less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` has been incremented by `leftOnes` and remains greater than or equal to `aOnes`. After the loop, if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both).***
