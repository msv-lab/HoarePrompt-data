Output State: **`a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, `leftOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
