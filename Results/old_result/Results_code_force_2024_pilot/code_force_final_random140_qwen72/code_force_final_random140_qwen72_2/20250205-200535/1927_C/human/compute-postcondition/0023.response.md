Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0 if `i` (which was 1) is in both `a` and `b`. If `i` (which was 1) is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` (which was 1) is in `b` but not in `a`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` (which was 1) is not in `a` and not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
