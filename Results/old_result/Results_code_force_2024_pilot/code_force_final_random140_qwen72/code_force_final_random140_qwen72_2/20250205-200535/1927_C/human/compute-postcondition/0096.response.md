Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. If `i` (which is now 2) is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both). If `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is not in `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
