Based on the provided initial state:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user.
- `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user.
- `newk` is defined as `k // 2`.
- `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, which is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`.
- `aOnes` is updated to be equal to `newk`.
- `bOnes` is also updated to be equal to `newk`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'yes'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **yes**
