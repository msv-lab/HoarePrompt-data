Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        leftOnes += 1
    elif i in a:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0 if `i` (which was 1) is in both `a` and `b`. If `i` (which was 1) is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` (which was 1) is in `b` but not in `a`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` (which was 1) is not in `a` and not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `leftOnes` is 1. If `i` (which was 2) is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and `leftOnes` is 2. If `i` (which was 2) is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` (which was 2) is in `b` but not in `a`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` (which was 2) is not in `a` and not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 5, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i` (which is 4) is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is 2. If `i` (which is 4) is in `a` but not in `b`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` (which is 4) is in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` (which is 4) is not in either `a` or `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `leftOnes` remains 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
