Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. The value of `aOnes` will be the initial `aOnes` plus the number of times `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` during the loop, and the value of `bOnes` will be the initial `bOnes` plus the number of times `bOnes` was less than or equal to `aOnes` during the loop.**
