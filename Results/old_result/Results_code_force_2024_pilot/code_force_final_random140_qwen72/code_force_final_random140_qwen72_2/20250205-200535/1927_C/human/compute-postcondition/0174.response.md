Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` (now 2) is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` (now 2) is in `a` but not in `b`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` (now 2) is in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `a` and not in `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
