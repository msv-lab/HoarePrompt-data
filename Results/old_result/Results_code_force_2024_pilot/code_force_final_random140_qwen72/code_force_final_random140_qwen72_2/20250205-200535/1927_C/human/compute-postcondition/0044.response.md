To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < leftOnes:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `leftOnes`.

2. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i < leftOnes`.
   - Given that `i` is 0, the loop will execute if `leftOnes` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
- The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `leftOnes` is greater than 0. All other states remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, and `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`.**
