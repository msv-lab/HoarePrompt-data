Postcondition: ***`a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `i` (now 2) is in `b`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1, and the values of `leftOnes` and `aOnes` depend on whether `i` is in `a` and/or `b`. If `i` (now 2) is not in `b`, the values of `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` depend on whether `i` is in `a` and/or `b`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
