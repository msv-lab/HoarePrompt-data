The code snippet `b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. This frozenset is then assigned to the variable `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user
- `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user

After executing the code snippet, the variable `b` is updated to contain a new frozenset of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user.**
