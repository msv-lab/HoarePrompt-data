Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i` (which is 4) is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is 2. If `i` (which is 4) is in `a` but not in `b`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` (which is 4) is in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` (which is 4) is not in either `a` or `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `leftOnes` remains 1.***
