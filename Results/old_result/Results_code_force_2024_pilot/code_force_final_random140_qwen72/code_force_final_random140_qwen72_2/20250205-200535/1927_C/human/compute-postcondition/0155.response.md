Postcondition: ***`a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in `a` but is in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` and not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
