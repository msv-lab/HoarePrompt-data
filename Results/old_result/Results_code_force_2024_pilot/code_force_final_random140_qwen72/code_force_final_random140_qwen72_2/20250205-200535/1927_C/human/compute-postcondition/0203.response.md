Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It checks if it's possible to distribute the first `k` integers (where `k` is even) between the sets `a` and `b` such that each set contains exactly `k/2` of these integers. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
