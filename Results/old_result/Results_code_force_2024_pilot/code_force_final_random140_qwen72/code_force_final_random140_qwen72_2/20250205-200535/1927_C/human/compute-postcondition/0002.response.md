The code `a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user.**
