Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of `max` values (when `x` was even) and `min` values (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence, and `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max` is set to 100000000.
- The values of `i`, `x`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `max` is reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop, but since the code only sets `max` to 100000000 and does not modify it further, this part of the initial state remains valid.
- The initial state also specifies that `min` is increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop, which remains unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is a string containing the sequence of `max` values (when `x` was even) and `min` values (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence, which remains unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, which remains unchanged.
