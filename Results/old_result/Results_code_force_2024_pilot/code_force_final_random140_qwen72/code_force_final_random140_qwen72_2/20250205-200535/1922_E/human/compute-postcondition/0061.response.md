The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was initially an input integer and must not be 1, after decrementing, `x` is now an input integer minus 1. The values of `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 depending on whether the original `x` was even or odd, `min` is -99999999 or -99999998 depending on whether the original `x` was even or odd, `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even or "-99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd, `t` is 1.**
