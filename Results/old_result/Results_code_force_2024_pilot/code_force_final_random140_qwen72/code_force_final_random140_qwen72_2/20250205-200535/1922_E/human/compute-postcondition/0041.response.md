Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of `max` values (when `x` was even) and `min` values (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence, and `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `min` is updated to -100000000.
- All other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `ans`, and `t`) retain their initial values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
