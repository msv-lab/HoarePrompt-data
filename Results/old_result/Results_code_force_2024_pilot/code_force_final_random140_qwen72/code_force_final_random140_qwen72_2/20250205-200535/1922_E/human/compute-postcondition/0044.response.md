To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while x != 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Given the state right before the loop:

- `i` is 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `max` is 100000000
- `min` is -100000000
- `ans` is an empty string
- `t` is 0

The only variable in the loop head is `x`. For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must not be equal to 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Current State of `x`**: `x` is an input integer.
3. **Adjustment Needed**: To ensure the loop executes at least once, `x` must be any integer except 1.

Since `x` is an input integer, it can be any value. However, to guarantee that the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that `x` is not 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is 0**
