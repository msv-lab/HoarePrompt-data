The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` depends on whether `x` was initially odd or even. If `x` was initially odd, `min` was `-99999999`, and if `x` was initially even, `min` was `-100000000`. After incrementing by 1, `min` will be `-99999998` if `x` was initially odd, or `-99999999` if `x` was initially even. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is not 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` was initially odd, or -99999999 if `x` was initially even, `ans` is `-100000000 99999999 100000000` if `x` was initially even, or `-99999999 -100000000 100000000` if `x` was initially odd, `t` is 2.**
