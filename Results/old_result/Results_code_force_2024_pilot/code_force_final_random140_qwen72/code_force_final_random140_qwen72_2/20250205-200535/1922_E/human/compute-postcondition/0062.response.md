Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was initially even, or `x - 1` if `x` was initially odd. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even. `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` was initially even, or "-100000000 100000000" if `x` was initially odd. `t` is 1.***
