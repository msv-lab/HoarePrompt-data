The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of integers that, when arranged, have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The sequence is constructed using a combination of the maximum value starting from 100,000,000 and the minimum value starting from -100,000,000, adjusting these values based on the parity of `X`. The function prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case. If no such sequence can be generated, the function does not explicitly return `-1`, but the behavior for such cases is not defined in the provided code.
