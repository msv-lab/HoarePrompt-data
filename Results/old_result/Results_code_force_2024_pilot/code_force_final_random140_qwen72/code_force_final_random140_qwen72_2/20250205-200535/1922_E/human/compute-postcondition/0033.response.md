Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `t` is 2. If `x` was originally even, `x` is now either `x // 4` (if the if part executes) or `(x // 2) - 1` (if the else part executes), and `x` must not be 1. If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now either `(x - 1) // 2` (if the if part executes) or `x - 2` (if the else part executes), and `x` must not be 1. The values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` depend on which part of the if-else block executes: if `x` was originally even and the if part executes, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000"; if the else part executes, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 99999999 100000000". If `x` was originally odd and the if part executes, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "100000000 -99999999 -100000000"; if the else part executes, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999997, and `ans` is "-99999998 -99999999 -100000000".***
