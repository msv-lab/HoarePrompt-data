The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `t` is 2, so after the increment, `t` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was initially even, or `x - 1` if `x` was initially odd. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even. `min` is -99999998 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even. `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000" if `x` was initially even, or "-99999999 -100000000 100000000" if `x` was initially odd. `t` is 3.**
