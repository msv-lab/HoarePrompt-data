Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `x` becomes 1. At the end of the loop, `i` remains 0, `x` is 1, `max` is reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop, `min` is increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of `max` values (when `x` was even) and `min` values (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence, and `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.** 

To break it down further:
- `i` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `x` is 1, indicating the loop has terminated.
- `max` is reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop, starting from 100000000.
- `min` is increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop, starting from -100000000.
- `ans` is a string that concatenates the values of `max` (when `x` was even) and `min` (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence.
- `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, which is the sum of the number of times `x` was even and the number of times `x` was odd.
