Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the returned array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = ''
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will continue to execute until `x` becomes 1. At the end of the loop, `i` remains 0, `x` is 1, `max` is reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop, `min` is increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of `max` values (when `x` was even) and `min` values (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence, and `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has completed its execution, `i` remains 1, `x` is 1, `max` is reduced by the number of even steps taken, `min` is increased by the number of odd steps taken, `ans` contains a sequence of numbers starting from the initial `max` or `min` value (depending on whether `x` was even or odd) and decreasing/increasing respectively with each step, and `t` is the total number of iterations taken to reach `x = 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even steps), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd steps), `ans` is a string of numbers starting from the initial `max` or `min` value and decreasing/increasing respectively with each step, separated by spaces, `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
