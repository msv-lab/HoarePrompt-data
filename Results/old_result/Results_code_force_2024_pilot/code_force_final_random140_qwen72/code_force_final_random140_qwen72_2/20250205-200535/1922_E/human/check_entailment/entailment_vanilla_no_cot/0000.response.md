Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues:

1. The logic for constructing the array does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach of alternating between adding the maximum and minimum values to the array based on whether `x` is even or odd does not directly correlate with the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed.

2. The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. According to the problem statement, if it is impossible to find the required array, the program should print `-1`.

3. The output format is incorrect. The program prints the length of the array followed by the elements, but it does not print the elements on a new line as required by the problem statement.

4. The variable names `max` and `min` are shadowing the built-in Python functions `max()` and `min()`, which can lead to unexpected behavior if these functions are used elsewhere in the code.

A correct solution would need to ensure that the constructed array meets the requirements of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences and follows the specified output format. Additionally, it should correctly identify when it is impossible to construct such an array.
