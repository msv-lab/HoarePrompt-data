Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an even input integer and must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000 ", `t` is 0.** 

The value of `ans` has been updated to include the string representation of `max` (which is "100000000") followed by a space and the original value of `ans` (which was an empty string). All other variables remain unchanged.
