Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` contains a sequence of numbers starting from the initial `max` or `min` value (depending on whether `x` was even or odd) and decreasing/increasing respectively with each step, and `t` is the total number of iterations taken to reach `x = 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `min` is updated to -100000000.
- All other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
