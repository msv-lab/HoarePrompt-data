Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `X` is a prime number greater than 2 correctly. For example, if `X = 37`, which is a prime number, the program will attempt to reduce `X` by subtracting 1 and adding a minimum value, but this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The program needs to ensure that the constructed array meets the exact requirement for the number of increasing subsequences for all valid inputs, including prime numbers.
