The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `min` followed by a space and the current value of `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `x` is not 1
- `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even
- `min` is -99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even
- `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` was initially even, or "-100000000 100000000" if `x` was initially odd
- `t` is 2

Let's consider the two cases for `x`:

1. **If `x` was initially even:**
   - `min` is -100000000
   - `ans` is "99999999 100000000"
   - After executing the code, `ans` becomes `-100000000 99999999 100000000`

2. **If `x` was initially odd:**
   - `min` is -99999999
   - `ans` is "-100000000 100000000"
   - After executing the code, `ans` becomes `-99999999 -100000000 100000000`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is not 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even, `ans` is `-100000000 99999999 100000000` if `x` was initially even, or `-99999999 -100000000 100000000` if `x` was initially odd, `t` is 2.**
