The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Depending on whether `x` was originally even or odd, the new value of `x` will be different.

- If `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2` and must not be 1. After the operation `x -= 1`, the new value of `x` will be `(x // 2) - 1`.
- If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 1` and must not be 1. After the operation `x -= 1`, the new value of `x` will be `(x - 1) - 1` which simplifies to `x - 2`.

The other variables (`i`, `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, if `x` was originally even, `x` is now `(x // 2) - 1` and must not be 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 99999999 100000000"; if `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 2` and must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999997, and `ans` is "-99999998 -99999999 -100000000".**
