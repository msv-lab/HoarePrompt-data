The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` depends on whether `x` was originally even or odd. If `x` was originally even, `min` is -100000000, and if `x` was originally odd, `min` is -99999998. After incrementing `min` by 1, the new value of `min` will be -99999999 if `x` was originally even, and -99999997 if `x` was originally odd. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, if `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2` and must not be 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 99999999 100000000"; if `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 1` and must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999997, and `ans` is "-99999998 -99999999 -100000000"**
