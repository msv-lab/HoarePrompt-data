Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing an array of integers with at most 200 elements such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array equals a given integer \( X \). If it's not possible to construct such an array, the program should output \(-1\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` and `min` to \( 10^8 \) and \(-10^8 \) respectively, which are within the allowed range for array elements.
   - It uses a loop to reduce \( X \) to 1 by either dividing \( X \) by 2 (if \( X \) is even) or subtracting 1 from \( X \) (if \( X \) is odd).
   - Depending on whether \( X \) is even or odd, it appends either a large positive number (`max`) or a small negative number (`min`) to the result string `ans`.
   - It decrements `max` or increments `min` accordingly to ensure unique values.
   - It keeps track of the number of elements added to the array using `t`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints the length of the array `t`.
   - It prints the constructed array `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic for constructing the array ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - The use of `max` and `min` ensures that the elements are within the allowed range.
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is reduced to 1, ensuring the final array has the correct number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where \( X \) is 1. However, the current implementation will still work correctly for \( X = 1 \) because the loop will not execute, and the program will print `0` for the length and an empty string for the array. This is technically correct, as an empty array has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 explicitly, but it does not need to because the loop will not execute, and the output will be correct.
   - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the way the algorithm works, the length will never exceed 200.

Given the above analysis, the program is correct and handles all edge cases appropriately. The original assessment was incorrect in suggesting that the program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1.

Final: **True**
