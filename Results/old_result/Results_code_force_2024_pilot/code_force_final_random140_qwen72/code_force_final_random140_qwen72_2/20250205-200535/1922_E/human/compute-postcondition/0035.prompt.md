Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is 0
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is "100000000" if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000', `t` is 1, and `x` is `x // 2` if `x` is even, otherwise `x` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 0, `t` is 2. If `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 1`, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 0, `t` is 3. If `x` was originally even, `x` is now either `x // 4` (if the if part executes) or `(x // 2) - 1` (if the else part executes), and `x` must not be 1. If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now either `(x - 1) // 2` (if the if part executes) or `x - 2` (if the else part executes), and `x` must not be 1. The values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` depend on which part of the if-else block executes: if `x` was originally even and the if part executes, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000"; if the else part executes, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 99999999 100000000". If `x` was originally odd and the if part executes, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "100000000 -99999999 -100000000"; if the else part executes, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999997, and `ans` is "-99999998 -99999999 -100000000".


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
