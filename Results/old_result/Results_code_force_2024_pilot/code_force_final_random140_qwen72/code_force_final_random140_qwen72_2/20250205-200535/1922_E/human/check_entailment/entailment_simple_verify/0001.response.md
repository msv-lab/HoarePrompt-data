Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing an array of integers with at most 200 elements such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array equals a given integer \( X \). If it's not possible to construct such an array, the program should output \(-1\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` and `min` to \( 10^8 \) and \(-10^8 \) respectively, which are within the allowed range for array elements.
   - It uses a loop to reduce \( X \) to 1 by either dividing \( X \) by 2 (if \( X \) is even) or subtracting 1 from \( X \) (if \( X \) is odd).
   - Depending on whether \( X \) is even or odd, it appends either a large positive number (`max`) or a small negative number (`min`) to the result string `ans`.
   - It decrements `max` or increments `min` accordingly to ensure unique values.
   - It keeps track of the number of elements added to the array using `t`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints the length of the array `t`.
   - It prints the constructed array `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic for constructing the array ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - The use of `max` and `min` ensures that the elements are within the allowed range.
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is reduced to 1, ensuring the final array has the correct number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The original assessment mentioned that the program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 correctly. However, upon closer inspection, the program does handle this case implicitly. When \( X \) is 1, the loop will not execute, and the program will print `t` (which is 0) and an empty `ans`. This is incorrect because the program should output a single element array when \( X \) is 1.

6. **Fix for Edge Case**:
   - To handle the edge case where \( X \) is 1, we need to add a check before entering the loop. If \( X \) is 1, we should directly print 1 and a single element array (e.g., [0]).

Given the above analysis, the program is mostly correct but lacks handling for the edge case where \( X \) is 1. Therefore, the correctness should be marked as **False**.

Final: **False**
