Reasoning:  
The program aims to generate an array of integers with a specific number of increasing subsequences, as defined by the input `X`. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Handling of `X = 1`**: The program does not handle the case where `X = 1` correctly. According to the problem statement, the program should output `-1` if it is impossible to find the required array. However, the program does not check for this condition and will enter an infinite loop if `X` is set to 1.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, but it does not handle the case where no valid array can be generated. Specifically, if the algorithm cannot construct a valid array, it should print `-1`, but the current implementation does not do this.

3. **Sequence Construction**: The logic for constructing the sequence is flawed. The program uses a combination of maximum and minimum values to adjust `X` based on its parity. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For example, the sequence construction might not work correctly for certain values of `X`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For instance, it does not check if the generated sequence exceeds the length limit of 200, which is a requirement in the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program is not correct according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
