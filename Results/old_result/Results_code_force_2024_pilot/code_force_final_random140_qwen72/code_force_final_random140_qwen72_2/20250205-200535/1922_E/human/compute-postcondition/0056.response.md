The code concatenates the string representation of `max` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Let's evaluate the impact:

- If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999 and `ans` is "100000000". After executing the code, `ans` becomes "99999999 100000000".
- If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000 and `ans` is "-100000000". After executing the code, `ans` becomes "100000000 -100000000".

The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "99999999 100000000", and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is now even, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is "100000000 -100000000", and `t` is 1.**
