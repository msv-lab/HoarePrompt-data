The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `x` depends on whether the original input integer was even or odd. After decrementing `x` by 1, the new value of `x` will be:

- If the original `x` was even (and thus `x` was originally the original input integer divided by 2), the new `x` will be the original input integer divided by 2 minus 1.
- If the original `x` was odd (and thus `x` was originally the original input integer minus 1), the new `x` will be the original input integer minus 2.

The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is the original input integer divided by 2 minus 1 if the original `x` was even, or the original input integer minus 2 if the original `x` was odd. `max` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd. `min` is -99999999 if the original `x` was even, or -99999998 if the original `x` was odd. `ans` is `"-100000000 100000000 100000000"` if the original `x` was even, or `"-99999999 99999999 -100000000"` if the original `x` was odd, or `"-100000000 -100000000 100000000"` if the original `x` was even and became odd, or `"-99999999 -99999999 -100000000"` if the original `x` was odd and remained odd. `t` is 2.**
