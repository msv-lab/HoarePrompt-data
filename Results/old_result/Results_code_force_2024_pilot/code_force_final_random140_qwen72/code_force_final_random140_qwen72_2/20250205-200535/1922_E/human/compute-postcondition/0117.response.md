The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a single integer `X` where `2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18`. The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that contains exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If it is not possible to construct such an array, the function should return `-1`. The elements of the returned array, if any, should be within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and returns an array of integers of length at most 200 that contains exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if any, are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].**
