To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications for the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` remains 1: This indicates that the loop has completed its execution, and the final value of `i` is 1.
- `x` is 1: This means that the loop has reached a point where `x` is 1.
- `max` is reduced by the number of even steps taken: This implies that `max` has been decreased by a certain amount based on the number of times `x` was even during the loop.
- `min` is increased by the number of odd steps taken: This implies that `min` has been increased by a certain amount based on the number of times `x` was odd during the loop.
- `ans` contains a sequence of numbers starting from the initial `max` or `min` value (depending on whether `x` was even or odd) and decreasing/increasing respectively with each step: This means that `ans` is a list of numbers that reflects the changes in `max` or `min` based on the parity of `x` during the loop.
- `t` is the total number of iterations taken to reach `x = 1`: This indicates the total number of steps taken in the loop to reach the final state.

### Analysis:
- Since `x` is 1, it suggests that the loop has completed and `x` has been reduced to 1.
- The sequence in `ans` depends on whether `x` started as even or odd. If `x` started as even, `ans` would start from `max` and decrease. If `x` started as odd, `ans` would start from `min` and increase.
- The exact values in `ans` depend on the initial values of `max` and `min`, and the number of even and odd steps taken.

### Example Scenario:
- Suppose `max` initially was 10 and `min` initially was 0.
- If `x` started as 4 (even), then `ans` might look like: `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- If `x` started as 5 (odd), then `ans` might look like: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the nature of the loop, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the sequence of numbers stored in `ans`.

Output: **[sequence of numbers in ans] (where the sequence starts from the initial max or min value and decreases/increases respectively with each step, depending on whether x was even or odd)**

For a more concrete example, if `x` started as 4 and `max` was 10, the output might be:
Output: **10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1**

If `x` started as 5 and `min` was 0, the output might be:
Output: **0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1**

However, without specific initial values for `max` and `min`, the most precise description is:
Output: **[sequence of numbers in ans] (where the sequence starts from the initial max or min value and decreases/increases respectively with each step, depending on whether x was even or odd)**
