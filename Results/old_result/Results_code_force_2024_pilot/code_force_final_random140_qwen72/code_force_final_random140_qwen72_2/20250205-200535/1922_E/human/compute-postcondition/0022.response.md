The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `min` was `-100000000` if `x` is even, and `-99999999` if `x` is odd, after the increment, `min` will be `-99999999` if `x` is even, and `-99999998` if `x` is odd.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999998, `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000", `t` is 1, and `x` is `x // 2` if `x` is even, otherwise `x` remains unchanged.**
