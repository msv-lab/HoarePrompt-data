Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop, `min` is increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of `max` values (when `x` was even) and `min` values (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence, and `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the integer value provided by the user.
- The values of `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment of `x`.
- The new value of `x` is now an integer input by the user.
