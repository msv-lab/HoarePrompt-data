The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`. Since `x` was initially not 1, and its parity (odd or even) affects the initial values of `max`, `min`, and `ans`, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `x` was initially odd, `x // 2` will result in an integer division that rounds down, making `x` an integer that is half of the original value, rounded down.
2. If `x` was initially even, `x // 2` will also result in an integer division, making `x` exactly half of the original value.

Since the exact initial value of `x` is not specified, we can only say that `x` is now half of its original value, considering the integer division.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is `x // 2` (where `x` was initially not 1), `max` is 99999998 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999997 if `x` was initially even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even, `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000" if `x` was initially even, or "99999999 -100000000 100000000" if `x` was initially odd, `t` is 2.**
