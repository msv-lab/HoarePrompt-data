To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind the variables:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is 100000000 - (number of even steps).
- `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd steps).
- `ans` is a string of numbers starting from the initial `max` or `min` value and decreasing/increasing respectively with each step, separated by spaces.
- `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `x`**: Since `x` is already 1, no iterations are needed to reduce it to 1. Therefore, `t` (the total number of iterations) is 0.
2. **Number of Steps**:
   - Since `x` is 1, there are no even or odd steps.
   - Therefore, the number of even steps is 0, and the number of odd steps is 0.
3. **Variables `max` and `min`**:
   - `max` = 100000000 - 0 = 100000000
   - `min` = -100000000 + 0 = -100000000
4. **Variable `ans`**:
   - Since there are no steps (even or odd), the string `ans` will start from either `max` or `min` and will not change because there are no steps to decrease or increase it.
   - Given that `x` is already 1, the initial value of `ans` will be either `max` or `min`.

### Conclusion:
Since `x` is already 1, the string `ans` will contain only one value, which is either `max` or `min`. Given the initial conditions, `max` is 100000000 and `min` is -100000000. Since the problem does not specify which one to use, we can assume the initial value is `max` (as it is the more positive and typical starting point).

### Final Output:
Output: **100000000**
