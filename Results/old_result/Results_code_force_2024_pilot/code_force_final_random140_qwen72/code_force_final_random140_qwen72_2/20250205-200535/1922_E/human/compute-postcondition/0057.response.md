The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Depending on whether `x` is even or odd, the initial value of `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000. After decrementing, `max` will be 99999998 if `x` is even, or 99999999 if `x` is odd. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "99999999 100000000", and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is now even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is "100000000 -100000000", and `t` is 1.**
