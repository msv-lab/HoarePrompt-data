Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing an array of integers with at most 200 elements such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array equals a given integer \( X \). If it's not possible to construct such an array, the program should output \(-1\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` and `min` to \( 10^8 \) and \(-10^8 \) respectively, which are within the allowed range for array elements.
   - It uses a loop to reduce \( X \) to 1 by either dividing \( X \) by 2 (if \( X \) is even) or subtracting 1 from \( X \) (if \( X \) is odd).
   - Depending on whether \( X \) is even or odd, it appends either a large positive number (`max`) or a small negative number (`min`) to the result string `ans`.
   - It decrements `max` or increments `min` accordingly to ensure unique values.
   - It keeps track of the number of elements added to the array using `t`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints the length of the array `t`.
   - It prints the constructed array `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic for constructing the array ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - The use of `max` and `min` ensures that the elements are within the allowed range.
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is reduced to 1, ensuring the final array has the correct number of increasing subsequences.

However, there is a potential issue:
- The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 correctly. When \( X \) is 1, the program should output a single element array, but it currently does not handle this edge case explicitly.

Given the above analysis, the program is mostly correct but lacks handling for the edge case where \( X \) is 1. Therefore, the correctness should be marked as **False**.

Correctness: **False**
