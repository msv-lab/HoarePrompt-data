The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `i` is 0, as it is the starting point of the `range`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
