The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2. If `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 1`, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".**
