Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '-100000000', `t` is 0, and `x` is even.**

Explanation: The code `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. Since `x` was initially an odd number greater than 0 and not equal to 1, subtracting 1 from it makes `x` an even number. All other variables remain unchanged.
