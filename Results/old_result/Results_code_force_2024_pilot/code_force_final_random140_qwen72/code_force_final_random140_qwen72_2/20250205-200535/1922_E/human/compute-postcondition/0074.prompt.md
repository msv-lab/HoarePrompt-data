Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000", and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is now even, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '-100000000', and `t` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 1, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was initially even, or `x - 1` if `x` was initially odd. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even. `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` was initially even, or "-100000000 100000000" if `x` was initially odd. `t` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 1, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was initially even, or `x - 1` if `x` was initially odd. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even. `min` is -99999998 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even. `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000" if `x` was initially even, or "-99999999 -100000000 100000000" if `x` was initially odd. `t` is 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
