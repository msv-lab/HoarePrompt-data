The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was initially even, or `x - 1` if `x` was initially odd. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be 1.

Since the exact value of `x` after the transformation is not specified, we need to ensure that `x` is not 1. Therefore, the state of `x` should be such that it is not equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is not 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even. `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` was initially even, or "-100000000 100000000" if `x` was initially odd. `t` is 2.**
