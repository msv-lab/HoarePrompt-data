Output State: **After the loop has completed its execution, `i` remains 1, `x` is 1, `max` is reduced by the number of even steps taken, `min` is increased by the number of odd steps taken, `ans` contains a sequence of numbers starting from the initial `max` or `min` value (depending on whether `x` was even or odd) and decreasing/increasing respectively with each step, and `t` is the total number of iterations taken to reach `x = 1`.**

To break it down further:
- `i` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `x` will be 1, as the loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
- `max` will be reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop's execution.
- `min` will be increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop's execution.
- `ans` will contain a sequence of numbers, where each number corresponds to the value of `max` or `min` at the start of each iteration, depending on whether `x` was even or odd.
- `t` will be the total number of iterations the loop went through to reduce `x` to 1.
