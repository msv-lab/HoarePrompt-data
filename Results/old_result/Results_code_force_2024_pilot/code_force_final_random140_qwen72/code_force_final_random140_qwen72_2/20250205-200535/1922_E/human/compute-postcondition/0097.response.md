Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is `x // 2` (where `x` is the original input integer divided by 2), `max` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 (or -99999999 if the original `x` was odd in the previous iteration), `ans` is "100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even, or "99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd, `t` is 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value (integer division). All other variables remain unchanged.
