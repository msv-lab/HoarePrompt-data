The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Depending on whether `x` was originally even or odd, `max` will be updated accordingly:

- If `x` was originally even, `max` was 99999998, so after decrementing, `max` is now 99999997.
- If `x` was originally odd, `max` was 100000000, so after decrementing, `max` is now 99999999.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, if `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2` and must not be 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000". If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 1` and must not be 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "100000000 -99999999 -100000000".**
