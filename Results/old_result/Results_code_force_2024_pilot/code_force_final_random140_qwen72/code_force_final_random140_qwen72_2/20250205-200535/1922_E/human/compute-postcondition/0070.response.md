The code `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. Since `x` was initially not 1, its new value will be `x - 1`. The parity (odd or even nature) of `x` will change after this operation. The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged.

- If `x` was initially odd, it will become even.
- If `x` was initially even, it will become odd.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `x` is `x - 1` (and its parity has changed), `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` was initially odd, or -99999999 if `x` was initially even, `ans` is `-100000000 99999999 100000000` if `x` was initially even, or `-99999999 -100000000 100000000` if `x` was initially odd, `t` is 2.**
