The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged.

- If the original `x` was even (and thus `x` was originally the original input integer divided by 2), `x` is now the original input integer divided by 2 minus 1.
- If the original `x` was odd (and thus `x` was originally the original input integer minus 1), `x` is now the original input integer minus 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 2, `x` is the original input integer divided by 2 minus 1 if it was even, or the original input integer minus 2 if it was odd. `max` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd. `min` is -99999999 if the original `x` was even, or -99999998 if the original `x` was odd. `ans` is `"-100000000 100000000 100000000"` if the original `x` was even, or `"-99999999 99999999 -100000000"` if the original `x` was odd, or `"-100000000 -100000000 100000000"` if the original `x` was even and became odd, or `"-99999999 -99999999 -100000000"` if the original `x` was odd and remained odd. `t` is 2.**
