### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - For example, if \( n = 12 \), the numbers on the board are initially 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. After replacing each number with the sum of its digits, the numbers become 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3. The sum of these numbers is 51.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program initializes a variable `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive) using a `for` loop.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `soma`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer \( n \) and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and summing these integers.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from 0 to 12, which means it processes the numbers 0 through 12.
   - However, the problem specifies that the numbers should be from 1 to \( n \). Therefore, the loop should start from 1, not 0.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number.

5. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the function `func_1` is \( O(\log n) \) because it iterates over the digits of the number.
   - The main loop runs 13 times, which is constant and well within the time limit of 0.5 seconds.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the range of the loop. It should start from 1 instead of 0 to match the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it includes 0 in the range, which is not part of the problem's requirement. The loop should start from 1 to \( n \).

Final: **False**
