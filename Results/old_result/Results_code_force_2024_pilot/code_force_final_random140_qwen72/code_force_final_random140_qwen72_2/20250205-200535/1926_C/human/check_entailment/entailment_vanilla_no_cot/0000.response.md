Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The provided program does not match the requirements of the problem statement.
- The problem requires handling multiple test cases (up to \(10^4\) test cases), but the given program only processes a single sequence of numbers from 0 to 12.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number, but the program does not handle multiple test cases or read input as specified.
- The program also prints the result of a single calculation, which is not what the problem asks for.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the value of \( n \).
3. Calculate the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
4. Print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    return sum(sum(int(d) for d in str(i)) for i in range(1, n + 1))

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    results.append(sum_of_digit_sums(n))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This version reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the results as required.
