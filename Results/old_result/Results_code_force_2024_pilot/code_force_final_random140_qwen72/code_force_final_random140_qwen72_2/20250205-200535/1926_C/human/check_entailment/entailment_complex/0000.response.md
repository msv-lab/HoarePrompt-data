Reasoning:  
The provided code snippet is incomplete and does not fully represent the solution to the problem. The problem requires handling multiple test cases and calculating the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to n for each test case. The given code only calculates the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to 12, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

Additionally, the code does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a single number, but it is not used in a way that solves the overall problem.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the value of `n`.
3. Compute the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `n`.
4. Output the result for each test case.

Given the current implementation, the program does not meet these requirements.

Correctness: **False**
