Reasoning:  
The provided program does not fully solve the problem as described. The problem requires handling multiple test cases and calculating the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case. However, the given program only calculates the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to 12 (inclusive) using a fixed loop and prints the result. It also defines a function `func_1` which correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number, but it is not used in the context of solving the problem for multiple test cases as required.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read the value of `n`.
3. Compute the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `n`.
4. Print the result for each test case.

Given that the provided program does not handle multiple test cases and does not follow the required input and output format, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
