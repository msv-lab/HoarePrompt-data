### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), we need to compute the sum of its digits and then sum these results.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program uses a loop to iterate from 1 to 12 (inclusive) and calls `func_1(i)` for each \( i \).
   - `func_1(n)` correctly computes the sum of the digits of the integer \( n \).

3. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - The function converts the integer \( n \) to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts it back to an integer, and sums these integers.
   - This is a correct implementation for summing the digits of a number.

4. **Loop and Summation**:
   - The loop `for i in range(13)` iterates from 0 to 12, but the problem specifies that the range should be from 1 to \( n \).
   - The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum of the results of `func_1(i)`.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `soma`, which is the sum of the digits of the numbers from 1 to 12.
   - However, the problem requires handling multiple test cases and different values of \( n \).

6. **Missing Elements**:
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the input format.
   - The loop should iterate from 1 to \( n \) instead of 0 to 12.
   - There is no input reading for \( t \) (number of test cases) and \( n \) (the largest number).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases and does not correctly iterate from 1 to \( n \). It also does not read the input as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
