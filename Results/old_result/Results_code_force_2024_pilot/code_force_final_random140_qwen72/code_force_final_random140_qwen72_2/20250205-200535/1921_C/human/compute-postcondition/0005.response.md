To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from 1 to `n`.
- `n`: This determines the upper bound of the loop.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not directly related to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `_` is 0 (this is not directly related to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input.
- `possible` is True (this is not directly related to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `possible` is True, `i` is 1**
