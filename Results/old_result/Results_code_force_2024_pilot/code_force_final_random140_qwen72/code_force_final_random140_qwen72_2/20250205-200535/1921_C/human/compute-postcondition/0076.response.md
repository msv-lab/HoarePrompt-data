Output State: **`possible` is True, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost, `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break.**

Explanation:
- The value of `energy_keep_on` is updated to `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
