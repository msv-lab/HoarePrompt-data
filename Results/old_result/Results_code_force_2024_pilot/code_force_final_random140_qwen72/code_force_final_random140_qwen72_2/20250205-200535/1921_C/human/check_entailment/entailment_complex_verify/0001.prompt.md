You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Additionally, each test case includes a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0 (since the loop has run `t` times), `_` is `t-1` (indicating the final iteration index), `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are the values provided by the user input for the last test case, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the message times for the last test case, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking for the last test case, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr` for the last test case, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on for the last test case, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b` for the last test case, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost for the last test case, and `possible` is True if the loop completes without breaking for the last test case, otherwise `possible` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages `n`, the initial phone's charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially `b`. For each test case, it also takes a list of moments `m` at which messages need to be sent. The function determines whether the phone can successfully send all messages within the given constraints. If the phone can send all messages, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the results of all test cases being printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case starts by reading the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `possible` to `True` and adds a `0` to the beginning of the `arr` list to handle the initial state of the phone at time `0`.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The program iterates through each message time from `1` to `n`:
   - It calculates the time difference between the current message time and the previous one.
   - It computes the energy cost of keeping the phone on (`energy_keep_on`) and the energy cost of turning the phone off and on again (`energy_turn_off_on`).
   - It chooses the minimum of these two costs as the energy cost for the current interval.
   - If the remaining charge `f` is less than or equal to the chosen energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it subtracts the chosen energy cost from the remaining charge `f`.

4. **Output**: After processing all messages for a test case, the program prints "YES" if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- **Correct Logic**: The logic correctly handles the decision of whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again based on the energy costs.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the initial state of the phone and the final state after all messages are sent.
- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently processes each test case in O(n) time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
