#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Additionally, each test case includes a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0 (since the loop has run `t` times), `_` is `t-1` (indicating the final iteration index), `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are the values provided by the user input for the last test case, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the message times for the last test case, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking for the last test case, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr` for the last test case, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on for the last test case, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b` for the last test case, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost for the last test case, and `possible` is True if the loop completes without breaking for the last test case, otherwise `possible` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages `n`, the initial phone's charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially `b`. For each test case, it also takes a list of moments `m` at which messages need to be sent. The function determines whether the phone can successfully send all messages within the given constraints. If the phone can send all messages, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the results of all test cases being printed.
