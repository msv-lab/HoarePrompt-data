Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, `f` is reduced by the value of `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
