Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the charge consumption. Specifically, the condition `if f <= energy_cost:` is incorrect. It should be `if f < energy_cost:` because if the remaining charge is exactly equal to the energy cost, the phone should still be able to send the message, but the current implementation would incorrectly mark this as a failure.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
1 3 1 2
3
```
In this case:
- Initial charge `f` is 3.
- Charge loss per unit time `a` is 1.
- Charge loss for turning off and on `b` is 2.
- Message needs to be sent at moment 3.

The phone starts with 3 units of charge. By the time the message needs to be sent at moment 3, the phone will have lost 3 units of charge (since `3 - 0 = 3`), leaving it with 0 units of charge. However, the program incorrectly checks `if f <= energy_cost`, which evaluates to `if 0 <= 2`, and marks this as a failure. The correct check should be `if f < energy_cost`, which would evaluate to `if 0 < 2`, allowing the message to be sent successfully.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
