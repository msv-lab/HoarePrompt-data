Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`.**

Explanation: The variable `energy_keep_on` is assigned the value of `a` multiplied by `time_diff`, which is the difference between the second and first elements of the array `arr`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `time_diff` remain unchanged.
