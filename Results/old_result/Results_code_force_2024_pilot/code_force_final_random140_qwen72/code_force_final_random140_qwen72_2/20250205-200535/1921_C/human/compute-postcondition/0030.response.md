Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`, `f` is `f - energy_cost`, `possible` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
