Output State: **`possible` is True, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break.**

Explanation:
- The `energy_cost` is calculated as the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`.
- `energy_keep_on` is calculated as `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`.
- `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.
- The value of `energy_cost` is now `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
