To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke.
   - `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`.
   - `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on.
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.
   - `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost.
   - `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break.
   - `possible` is True if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `possible` is False.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The key variable here is `possible`.
   - `possible` is determined by whether the loop completes without breaking.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `possible` is set to True.
   - If the loop breaks because `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to False.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If the loop completes without breaking, the output will be 'YES'.
   - If the loop breaks, the output will be 'NO'.

Given this analysis, the output of the `print` statement depends on the value of `possible`:

Output: **'YES' if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise 'NO'**
