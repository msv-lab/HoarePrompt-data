Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of the list `arr` and assigns this difference to the variable `time_diff`. Since `arr` starts with 0 and is followed by integers provided by the user input, `time_diff` is specifically the value of the second element of `arr` (since `arr[0]` is 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
