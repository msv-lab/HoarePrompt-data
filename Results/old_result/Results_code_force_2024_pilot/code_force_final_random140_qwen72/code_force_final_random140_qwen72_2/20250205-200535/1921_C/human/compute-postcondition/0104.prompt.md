Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Additionally, each test case includes a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    possible = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
        energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
        energy_turn_off_on = b
        energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
        if f <= energy_cost:
            possible = False
            break
        f -= energy_cost
    print('YES' if possible else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost, and `possible` is False if the loop broke due to `f` being less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost, `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break, `possible` is True if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `possible` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `possible` is True or False depending on whether the loop completed without breaking or not, `arr` remains the same as it was initially, `n` remains the same as it was initially, `f` is reduced by the sum of the `energy_cost` values from each iteration where the loop did not break, `a` remains the same as it was initially, `b` remains the same as it was initially, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
