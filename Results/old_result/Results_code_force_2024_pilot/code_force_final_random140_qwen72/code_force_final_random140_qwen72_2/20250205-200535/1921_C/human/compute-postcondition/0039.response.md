To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The objects in the loop head are:
- `i`: The loop variable.
- `n`: The upper bound of the range.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must start at 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since the range is from 1 to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0 for the loop to run at least once).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (this condition is already satisfied).
- `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will be set to 1 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 1, no further adjustment is needed for `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
