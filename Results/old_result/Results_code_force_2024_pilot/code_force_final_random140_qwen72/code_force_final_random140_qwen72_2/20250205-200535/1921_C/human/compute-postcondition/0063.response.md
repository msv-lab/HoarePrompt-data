Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`. If `f` was less than or equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`, `f` is now 0 and `possible` is set to `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `f` is reduced by the value of the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`.**
