Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0 (since the loop has run `t` times), `_` is `t-1` (indicating the final iteration index), `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are the values provided by the user input for the last test case, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the message times for the last test case, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking for the last test case, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr` for the last test case, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on for the last test case, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b` for the last test case, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost for the last test case, and `possible` is True if the loop completes without breaking for the last test case, otherwise `possible` is False.**
