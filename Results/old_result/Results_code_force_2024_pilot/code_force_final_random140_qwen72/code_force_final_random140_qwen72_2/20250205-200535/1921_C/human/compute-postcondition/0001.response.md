To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the variable `t`.

- The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop to iterate through the range of `t`.
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` will start from 0 (the default starting value for `range`).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
