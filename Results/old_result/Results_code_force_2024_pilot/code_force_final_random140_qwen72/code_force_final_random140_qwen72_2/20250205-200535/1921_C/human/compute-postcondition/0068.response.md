Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost, `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break, `possible` is True if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `possible` is False.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will either be `n + 1` if the loop completed without breaking, or it will be the iteration number at which the loop broke because `f` became less than or equal to the `energy_cost`. The `time_diff` will be the last difference calculated between consecutive elements in the `arr` list, `energy_keep_on` will be the last cost of keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` will still be `b`, `energy_cost` will be the last minimum cost calculated, `f` will be reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break, and `possible` will be `True` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise it will be `False`.
