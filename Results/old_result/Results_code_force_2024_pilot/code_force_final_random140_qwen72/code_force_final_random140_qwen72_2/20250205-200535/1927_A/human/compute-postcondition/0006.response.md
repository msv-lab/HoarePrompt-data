Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `min_paint` is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
