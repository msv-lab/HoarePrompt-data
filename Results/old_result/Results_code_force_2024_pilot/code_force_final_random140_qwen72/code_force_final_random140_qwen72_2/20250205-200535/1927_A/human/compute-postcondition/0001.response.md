To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip.
- `s` is a string of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in s is 'B'.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n` and `s`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
