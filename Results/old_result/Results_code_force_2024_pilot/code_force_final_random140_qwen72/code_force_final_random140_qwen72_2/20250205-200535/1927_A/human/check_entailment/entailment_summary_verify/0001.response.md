Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to ensure all cells in the strip become white. This involves identifying the smallest segment that includes all black cells.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the strip.

3. **Finding the Segment**:
   - The program uses `s.find('B')` to find the index of the first black cell.
   - It uses `s.rfind('B')` to find the index of the last black cell.
   - The length of the segment that needs to be painted is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the segment for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is only one black cell, the segment length will be 1.
   - If the strip is entirely black, the segment length will be the length of the strip.
   - If the strip has no black cells, the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this case is not possible.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the minimum segment that needs to be painted.
   - The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
   - The use of `s.find('B')` and `s.rfind('B')` ensures that the first and last black cells are accurately identified, and the calculation `last_black - first_black + 1` correctly computes the length of the segment.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **True**
