You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        first_black = s.find('B')
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        print(min_paint)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip. s is a string of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in s is 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        first_black = s.find('B')
        
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        
        print(min_paint)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `s` is the last input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the last `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the last `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be painted to cover all black cells ('B') in the string `s`. This value is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. The final state of the program includes the last processed values of `n`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint`, but these are not returned or used outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by identifying the positions of the first and last black cells ('B'), and calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. This approach ensures that all black cells are covered by the smallest possible segment, which aligns with the problem's requirements. The program handles all edge cases, such as when there is only one black cell or when the strip is entirely white except for one black cell. No counterexample has been found where the program fails to produce the correct output.
