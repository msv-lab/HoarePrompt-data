Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip. s is a string of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in s is 'B'.**
