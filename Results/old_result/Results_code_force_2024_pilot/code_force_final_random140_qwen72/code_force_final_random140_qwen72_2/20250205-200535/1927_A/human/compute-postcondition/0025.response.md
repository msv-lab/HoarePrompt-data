Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B'.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is a list of characters from the new input.
- If the new input `x` contains any 'B', `start` and `end` remain unchanged.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(0)
```

This code simply prints the integer `0`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **0**
