You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        first_black = s.find('B')
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        print(min_paint)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip. s is a string of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in s is 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        first_black = s.find('B')
        
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        
        print(min_paint)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `s` is the last input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the last `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the last `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells in the strip become white. This means we need to identify the smallest segment that includes all black cells.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the strip.

3. **Finding the Segment**:
   - The program uses `s.find('B')` to find the index of the first black cell.
   - It uses `s.rfind('B')` to find the index of the last black cell.
   - The length of the segment that needs to be painted is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the segment for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is only one black cell, the segment length will be 1.
   - If the strip is entirely black, the segment length will be the length of the strip.
   - If the strip has no black cells, the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this case is not possible.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the minimum segment that needs to be painted.
   - The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
