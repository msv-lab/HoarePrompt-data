Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` (but still greater than 0), `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the new `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the new `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer.
- The values of `t`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint` remain unchanged from their initial state.
