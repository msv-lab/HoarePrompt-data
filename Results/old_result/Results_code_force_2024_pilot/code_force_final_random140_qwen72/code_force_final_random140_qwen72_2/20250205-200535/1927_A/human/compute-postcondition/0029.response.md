Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string `s`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of a strip, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in the strip is black. The function calculates and prints the distance between the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string `s` for each test case. If no 'B' is found in the string (which is guaranteed not to happen), it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
