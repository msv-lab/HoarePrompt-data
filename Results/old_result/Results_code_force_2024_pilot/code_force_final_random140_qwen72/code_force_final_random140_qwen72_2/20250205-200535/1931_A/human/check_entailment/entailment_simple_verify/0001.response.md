### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose letter indices sum up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and initializes three empty strings `a`, `b`, and `c` to store the letters of the word.
   - It then uses a series of conditions to determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the value of `n`.

3. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `n // 26 == 0`**
     - This means `n` is less than 26.
     - The program sets `a` and `b` to 'a' (index 1) and `c` to the character with index `n - 2`.
     - Example: For `n = 24`, `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, `c = 'v'` (since `24 - 2 = 22` and `chr(96 + 22) = 'v'`).
   - **Case 2: `n // 26 == 1`**
     - This means `n` is between 27 and 52.
     - The program sets `a` to 'a' (index 1), `b` to the character with index `n - 27`, and `c` to 'z' (index 26).
     - Example: For `n = 53`, `a = 'a'`, `b = 'r'` (since `53 - 27 = 26` and `chr(96 + 26) = 'z'`), `c = 'z'`.
   - **Case 3: `n // 26 == 2`**
     - This means `n` is between 53 and 78.
     - The program sets `a` to the character with index `n - 52`, `b` to 'z' (index 26), and `c` to 'z' (index 26).
     - Example: For `n = 78`, `a = 'r'` (since `78 - 52 = 26` and `chr(96 + 26) = 'z'`), `b = 'z'`, `c = 'z'`.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - The program prints the concatenated string `a + '' + b + '' + c`.
   - This ensures that the output is a 3-letter word.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 3`, the output is `aaa` (since `3 - 2 = 1` and `chr(96 + 1) = 'a'`).
     - For `n = 78`, the output is `rzz` (since `78 - 52 = 26` and `chr(96 + 26) = 'z'`).

6. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly handles the conversion of `num` to a character using `chr(num + 96)`.
   - The conditions and logic used in the program ensure that the lexicographically smallest word is generated for each valid `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for the given sum `n`. The logic and conditions used are appropriate and cover all possible cases within the given constraints.

Final: **True**
