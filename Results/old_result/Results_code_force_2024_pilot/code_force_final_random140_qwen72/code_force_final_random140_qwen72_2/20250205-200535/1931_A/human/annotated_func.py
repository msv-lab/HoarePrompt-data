#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 3 ≤ num ≤ 78.
def func_1(num):
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `num + 96`. Since `num` is an integer between 3 and 26, the returned value will be a lowercase letter from 'c' to 'z'.
    #State: num is an integer such that 3 ≤ num ≤ 78, and num is greater than 26.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` (3 ≤ num ≤ 78) and returns a lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `num + 96` if `num` is between 1 and 26. If `num` is greater than 26, the function does not return any value, resulting in `None`.
