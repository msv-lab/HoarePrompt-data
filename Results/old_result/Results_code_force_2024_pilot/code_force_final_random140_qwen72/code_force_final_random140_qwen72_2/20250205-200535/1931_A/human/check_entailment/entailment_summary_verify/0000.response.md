### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums to a given integer `n`. The logic is divided into three main cases based on the value of `n // 26`:

1. **Case 1: `n // 26 == 0`**
   - This means `n` is between 3 and 26.
   - The program sets `a` and `b` to 'a' and `c` to the character corresponding to `n - 2`.
   - Example: For `n = 24`, `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, `c = 'v'` (since `chr(96 + 22) = 'v'`).

2. **Case 2: `n // 26 == 1`**
   - This means `n` is between 27 and 52.
   - The program sets `a` to 'a', `b` to the character corresponding to `n - 27`, and `c` to 'z'.
   - Example: For `n = 50`, `a = 'a'`, `b = 'x'` (since `chr(96 + 23) = 'x'`), `c = 'z'`.

3. **Case 3: `n // 26 == 2`**
   - This means `n` is between 53 and 78.
   - The program sets `a` to the character corresponding to `n - 52`, and both `b` and `c` to 'z'.
   - Example: For `n = 78`, `a = 'z'`, `b = 'z'`, `c = 'z'`.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` converts an integer `num` (1 ≤ num ≤ 26) to its corresponding lowercase letter. If `num` is outside this range, it returns `None`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it mentions the test case `n = 48` where the expected output is `auz` but the actual output is `azz`.

#### Evaluation:
Let's verify the program with the test case `n = 48`:

- **Case 2: `n // 26 == 1`**
  - `a = 'a'`
  - `b = chr(96 + (48 - 27)) = chr(96 + 21) = 'u'`
  - `c = 'z'`
  - Therefore, the output is `auz`.

The program correctly handles the test case `n = 48` and produces the lexicographically smallest word `auz`.

However, let's consider another test case to ensure the program is robust:

- **Test Case: `n = 55`**
  - **Expected Output**: `czz`
  - **Actual Output**:
    - `n // 26 == 2`
    - `a = chr(96 + (55 - 52)) = chr(96 + 3) = 'c'`
    - `b = 'z'`
    - `c = 'z'`
    - Therefore, the output is `czz`.

The program also correctly handles the test case `n = 55`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the test cases provided in the original assessment and additional test cases. The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
