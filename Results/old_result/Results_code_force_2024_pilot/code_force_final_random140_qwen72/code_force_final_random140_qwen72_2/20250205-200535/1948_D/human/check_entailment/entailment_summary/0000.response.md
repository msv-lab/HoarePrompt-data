Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Scope of `n` and `s`:** The variables `n` and `s` are defined in the outer scope but used inside `func_1`. This is a common mistake and can lead to errors if the function is called without these variables being properly set in the outer scope.

2. **Return Value Handling:** The function `func_1` should return the result instead of printing it directly. The main loop should handle the output.

3. **Edge Case Handling:** The function does not handle the case where no tandem repeat is found correctly. It should return 0 if no valid tandem repeat is found.

4. **Correctness of Tandem Repeat Logic:** The logic for finding the tandem repeat is not entirely correct. The current implementation checks for a sequence of matching or question mark characters but does not ensure that the entire substring is a tandem repeat.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_max_tandem_repeat(s):
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        for k in range(n - 2 * j + 1):
            if all(s[k + l] == s[k + j + l] or s[k + l] == '?' or s[k + j + l] == '?' for l in range(j)):
                return 2 * j
    return 0

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    print(find_max_tandem_repeat(s))
```

### Explanation:
- **Function `find_max_tandem_repeat`:** This function takes a string `s` and returns the length of the longest tandem repeat.
- **Loop Over Possible Lengths:** The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat from `n // 2` down to 1.
- **Check for Tandem Repeat:** For each possible length `j`, the inner loop checks all possible starting positions `k` for a substring of length `2*j`. It uses a generator expression to check if the first half matches the second half, considering question marks as wildcards.
- **Return the Result:** If a valid tandem repeat is found, it returns the length of the repeat. If no valid tandem repeat is found, it returns 0.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
