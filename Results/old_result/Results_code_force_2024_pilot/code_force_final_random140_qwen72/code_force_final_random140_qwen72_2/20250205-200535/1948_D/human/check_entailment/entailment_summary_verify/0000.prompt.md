You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4

    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    func_1()

def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    return 0



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` that consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It searches for repeating patterns within the string, specifically looking for sequences where characters match or are question marks. If a valid repeating pattern of length `j` (where `j` is at least 1 and up to half the length of the string) is found, the function prints the length of this pattern multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such pattern is found after checking all possible lengths, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input string `s` and does not have side effects beyond printing and returning values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Scope Issue**: The variable `n` used in `func_1()` is not defined within the scope of this function. It is defined in the outer loop but not passed to `func_1()`. This will cause a `NameError` when `func_1()` tries to access `n`.

2. **Incorrect Return Value**: If no tandem repeat is found, the function should return 0, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. The function returns `None` instead of 0, which is not the expected output.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the string is entirely composed of question marks (`'?'`). For example, for the input `"?????"`, the program should return 4, but it may not correctly identify this.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    result = func_1(s, n)
    print(result)

def func_1(s, n):
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                return count * 2
    return 0
```

This corrected version ensures that `n` is passed to `func_1()` and handles the case where no tandem repeat is found by explicitly returning 0.
