#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually take a string `s` as an argument, and the problem description suggests that the function should handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the function will be called multiple times with different strings `s`.
def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `n` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - 1`, and `count` is 0. The loop has not printed any value or returned, indicating that no valid pair sequence of length `j` was found for any `j` from `n // 2` down to 1.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` that consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It searches for repeating patterns within the string, specifically looking for sequences where characters match or are question marks. If a valid repeating pattern of length `j` (where `j` is at least 1 and up to half the length of the string) is found, the function prints the length of this pattern multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such pattern is found after checking all possible lengths, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input string `s` and does not have side effects beyond printing and returning values.
