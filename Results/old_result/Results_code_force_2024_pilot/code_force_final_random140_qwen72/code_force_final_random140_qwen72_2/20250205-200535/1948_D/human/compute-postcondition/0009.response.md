Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `j` is `n // 2`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - If `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - It is also given that `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - The current value of `count` is equal to `j`.

2. **Determine the value of `count`:**
   - According to the conditions, `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - This means the condition `s[k] is '?', s[k + j] is '?', or s[k] is equal to s[k + j]` is false.
   - Therefore, `count` should be 0.
   - However, it is explicitly stated that the current value of `count` is equal to `j`.

3. **Determine the value of `j`:**
   - `j` is `n // 2`.
   - Since `n` is at least 2, `j` will be at least 1 (if `n` is 2, `j` is 1; if `n` is 3, `j` is 1; if `n` is 4, `j` is 2, and so on).

4. **Calculate the value of `count * 2`:**
   - Given that `count` is equal to `j`, and `j` is at least 1, the value of `count` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, `count * 2` will be at least 2.

Since `count` is equal to `j`, and `j` is `n // 2`, the value of `count * 2` will be `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the value of n, which is at least 2)**
