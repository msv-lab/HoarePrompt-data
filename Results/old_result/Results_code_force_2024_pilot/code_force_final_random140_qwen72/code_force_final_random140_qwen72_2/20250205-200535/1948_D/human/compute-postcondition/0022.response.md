Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2, `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, `count` is not equal to `j`. Additionally, `2 < n - j` must be true. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
