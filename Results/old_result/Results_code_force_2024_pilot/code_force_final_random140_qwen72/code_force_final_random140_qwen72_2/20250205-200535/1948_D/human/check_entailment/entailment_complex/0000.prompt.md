Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually take a string `s` as an argument, and the problem description suggests that the function should handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the function will be called multiple times with different strings `s`.
def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `n` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - 1`, and `count` is 0. The loop has not printed any value or returned, indicating that no valid pair sequence of length `j` was found for any `j` from `n // 2` down to 1.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` that consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It searches for repeating patterns within the string, specifically looking for sequences where characters match or are question marks. If a valid repeating pattern of length `j` (where `j` is at least 1 and up to half the length of the string) is found, the function prints the length of this pattern multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such pattern is found after checking all possible lengths, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input string `s` and does not have side effects beyond printing and returning values.
