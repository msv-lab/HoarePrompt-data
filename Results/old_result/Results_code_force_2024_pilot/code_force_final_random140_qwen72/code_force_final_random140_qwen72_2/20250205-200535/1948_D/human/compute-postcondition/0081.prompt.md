Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` should actually take a string `s` as an argument, and the problem description suggests that the function should handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the function will be called multiple times with different strings `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j - 1`. The final value of `count` depends on the conditions within the loop. If `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` is reset to 0. If `count` ever reaches `j`, the program prints `count * 2` and returns. If the loop completes without `count` reaching `j`, `count` will be less than `j` and no value will be printed or returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`. The loop has completed its iterations. If `count` was ever equal to `j` during the loop, the program printed `j * 2` and returned. Otherwise, `count` is the final count of consecutive valid pairs found, but it did not reach `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2) + (n - j) - 1`, `count` is 0. The loop has completed all its iterations without `count` ever reaching `j`, so no value is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
