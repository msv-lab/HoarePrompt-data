Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2) + 2`, `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, `count` is not equal to `j`. If `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0. If `count == j`, the program does not return any value.***
