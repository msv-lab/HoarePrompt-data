Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1. If `s[1]` is '?', `s[1 + j]` is '?', or `s[1]` is equal to `s[1 + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, if `s[1]` is not '?', `s[1 + j]` is not '?', and `s[1]` is not equal to `s[1 + j]`, then `count` is 0. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program does not return any value.***
