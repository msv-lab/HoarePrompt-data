### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem statement.

2. **String Conversion**: The program converts the input string `s` into a list of characters. This is a common practice in Python to allow easy modification of individual characters.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined but called without passing the necessary parameters (`s` and `n`). This is a mistake because `func_1()` needs to know the string `s` and its length `n` to perform the required operations. The annotated code confirms that `func_1` should take `s` as an argument.

4. **Tandem Repeat Check**: The function `func_1()` attempts to find the longest tandem repeat by iterating over possible lengths of the tandem repeat from the largest possible (half the length of the string) down to 1. This approach is correct in theory.

5. **Counting Matches**: For each possible tandem repeat length `j`, the program checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either both question marks, one is a question mark and the other is a character, or both are the same character. If any of these conditions are met, it increments the count. This logic is correct for identifying potential tandem repeats.

6. **Printing the Result**: If the count reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the program prints this length and returns. If no tandem repeat is found, the function should return 0, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

7. **Return Value**: The function `func_1()` should return 0 if no tandem repeat is found, but the current implementation does not explicitly handle this case. Instead, it relies on the function returning `None` implicitly, which is not the correct behavior.

8. **Scope Issue**: The variable `n` is defined in the outer loop but used inside `func_1()`. This is a scope issue and will result in a `NameError` because `n` is not defined within `func_1()`.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the program is indeed incorrect due to the scope issue, the missing parameter passing, and the lack of a proper return value for the case where no tandem repeat is found.

**Final: False**
