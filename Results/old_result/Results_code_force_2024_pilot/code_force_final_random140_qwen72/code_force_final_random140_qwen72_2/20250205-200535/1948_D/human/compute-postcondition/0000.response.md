The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop starts from `n // 2` and decrements `j` until it reaches 0. For the loop to execute at least once, `n // 2` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2, and `j` starts at `n // 2`.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`**
