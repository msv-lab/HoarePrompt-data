Postcondition: **`n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is equal to `j`.**
