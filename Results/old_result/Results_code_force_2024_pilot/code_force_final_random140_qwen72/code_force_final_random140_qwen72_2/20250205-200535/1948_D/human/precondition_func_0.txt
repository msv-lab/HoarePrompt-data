The function `func_1` should actually take a string `s` as an argument, and the problem description suggests that the function should handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the function will be called multiple times with different strings `s`.
