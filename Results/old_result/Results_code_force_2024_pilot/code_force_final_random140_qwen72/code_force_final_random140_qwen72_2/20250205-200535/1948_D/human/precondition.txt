The function `solve()` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), indicating the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000), where s consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000.
