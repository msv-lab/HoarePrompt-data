To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for k in range(0, n - j):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `k`, `n`, and `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(0, n - j)` is non-empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, the upper bound `n - j` must be greater than 0.

3. **Given Initial State:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `j` is `n // 2`.
   - `count` is 0.

4. **Calculate `j`:**
   - Since `j` is `n // 2`, for `n` being at least 2:
     - If `n = 2`, then `j = 2 // 2 = 1`.
     - If `n = 3`, then `j = 3 // 2 = 1`.
     - If `n = 4`, then `j = 4 // 2 = 2`.
     - And so on...

5. **Ensure the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n - j` must be greater than 0.
   - Given `j = n // 2`, we need to ensure that `n - (n // 2) > 0`.

6. **Simplify the Condition:**
   - `n - (n // 2) > 0` simplifies to `n / 2 > 0`.
   - Since `n` must be at least 2, `n / 2` will always be greater than 0.

7. **Adjust the State:**
   - The initial state already ensures that `n` is at least 2, which means `n - j` will always be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `j` is `n // 2`.
- `count` is 0.
- `k` is 0 (initial value of the loop variable).

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0, `k` is 0**
