### Reasoning:

1. **Scope Issue**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the variable `n` is not defined within the scope of `func_1()`. This will indeed cause a `NameError` when `func_1()` tries to access `n`. To fix this, `n` should be passed as an argument to `func_1()`.

2. **Incorrect Return Value**: The original assessment also correctly points out that if no tandem repeat is found, the function should return 0, but the current implementation returns `None` instead of 0. This is because the function does not explicitly return 0 at the end of the function. Adding an explicit return statement at the end of `func_1()` will resolve this issue.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The original assessment mentions that the program does not handle the case where the string is entirely composed of question marks (`'?'`). However, the function `func_1()` is designed to handle such cases correctly. If the string is entirely composed of question marks, the function will still find the longest possible tandem repeat by treating all question marks as matching any character. Therefore, the edge case handling is actually correct in the original implementation.

### Corrected Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    result = func_1(s, n)
    print(result)

def func_1(s, n):
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                return count * 2
    return 0
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the scope issue and the incorrect return value.
- The edge case handling for strings entirely composed of question marks is actually correct in the original implementation.

Given the corrections and the reasoning above, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the scope issue and the incorrect return value, but the edge case handling is correct.)
