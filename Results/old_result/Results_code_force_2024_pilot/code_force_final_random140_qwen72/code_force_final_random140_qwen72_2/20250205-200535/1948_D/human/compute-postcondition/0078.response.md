Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

Explanation: The given code snippet ends with a `return` statement without specifying any value to return. In Python, if a function reaches a `return` statement without any value following it, it effectively returns `None`. However, since the task specifies to describe the output state in natural language and there's no explicit value being returned, the correct interpretation is that the program does not return any value.
