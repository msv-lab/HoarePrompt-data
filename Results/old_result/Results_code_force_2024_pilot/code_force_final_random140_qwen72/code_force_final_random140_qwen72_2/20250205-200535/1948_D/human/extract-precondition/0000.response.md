Precondition: **The function `func_1` should actually take a string `s` as an argument, and the problem description suggests that the function should handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the function will be called multiple times with different strings `s`.** 

However, based on the provided function definition `def func_1():`, which does not include any parameters, the precondition cannot be accurately stated without modifying the function definition to match the problem description. If we assume the function definition should be `def func_1(s):`, then the precondition would be:

**s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length of 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000.**

Given the function definition as provided (`def func_1():`), the precondition is not applicable as the function does not accept any arguments.
