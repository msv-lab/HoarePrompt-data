Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` contains the second and third elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and the element at index `i` (which is 2) of `lit`, and `b` remains either a list containing the second element of `lit` or remains empty.***
