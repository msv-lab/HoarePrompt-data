The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute based on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**
