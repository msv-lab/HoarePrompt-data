The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `b`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `b`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison and must have at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- `b` must still have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue, meaning `len(b)` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element. If `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `len(a)` is the final length of `a`, `len(b)` must be greater than 3**
