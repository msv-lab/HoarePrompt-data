To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 1
- `n` is the same as the initial input integer
- `lit` is the same list of integers read from input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`
- `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `b` starting from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
- The variable `i` is the loop index and is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` should be `len(a) - 1 + 1` which simplifies to `len(a)`.

### Final State:
- `i` is now `len(a)`
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `len(b)`. Therefore, `len(b)` must be greater than `len(a)`.

### State:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a)`, and `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1, and `len(b)` must be greater than `len(a)`.**
