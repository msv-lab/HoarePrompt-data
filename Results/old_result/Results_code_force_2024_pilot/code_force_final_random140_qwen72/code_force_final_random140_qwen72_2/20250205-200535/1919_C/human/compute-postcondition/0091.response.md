Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**

Explanation:
- `a` is now a list containing only the first element of `lit`.
- `b` is initialized as an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `s`) retain their initial values or conditions.
