Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3. If the last element of `a` (which is the element at index 2 of `lit`) is less than the element at index 3 of `lit`, then `a` contains the first and the element at index 2 of `lit`, and `b` contains the second and the element at index 3 of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains the first, the element at index 2, and the element at index 3 of `lit`, and `b` contains the second element of `lit`.***
