Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b` and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.**
