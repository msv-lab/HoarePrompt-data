Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `a` must have at least `n + 1` elements, `s` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1.
- Initially, `s` is 0 (as per the precondition).
- After executing `s += 1`, `s` becomes 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
