The value of `s` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus 1, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `len(a)` is the final length of `a`, `len(b)` must be greater than 3.**
