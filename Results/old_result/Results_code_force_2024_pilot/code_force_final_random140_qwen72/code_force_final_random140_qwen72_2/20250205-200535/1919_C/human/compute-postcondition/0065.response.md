To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 1
- `n` is the same as the initial input integer
- `lit` is the same list of integers read from input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`
- `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `s` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(a)` must be greater than 1. This means `a` must have at least 2 elements.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` in the loop head is initialized to 1 and will increment up to `len(a) - 1`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least 2 elements.

### Final State:
- `a` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1 (as it is the starting point of the loop).

### State:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is 0.**
