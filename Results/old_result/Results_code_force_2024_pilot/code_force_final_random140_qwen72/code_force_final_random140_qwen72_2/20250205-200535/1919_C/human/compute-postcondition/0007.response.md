The code `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the second element of `lit` is added to `b`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`.**
