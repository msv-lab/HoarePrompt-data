Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and the element at index 2 of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the element at index 3 of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3.** 

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index 3 of `lit` to the list `b`. Since `b` initially contained the second element of `lit`, after executing the code, `b` now contains both the second and third elements of `lit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
