Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` and the third element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the third element of `lit` (since `i` is 2) to the list `b`.
- Initially, `b` was either a list containing the second element of `lit` or an empty list. After appending the third element of `lit`, `b` now contains both the second and third elements of `lit`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
