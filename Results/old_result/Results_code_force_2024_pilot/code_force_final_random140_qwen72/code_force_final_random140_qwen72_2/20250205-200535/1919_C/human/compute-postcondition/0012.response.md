The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`
- `b` is either a list containing the second element of `lit` or remains empty
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 2

If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` contains the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains both the first and the second elements of `lit`, and `b` remains empty.

After executing `b.append(lit[i])`:
- The value of `lit[i]` (which is the third element of `lit` since `i` is 2) is appended to `b`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2.**
