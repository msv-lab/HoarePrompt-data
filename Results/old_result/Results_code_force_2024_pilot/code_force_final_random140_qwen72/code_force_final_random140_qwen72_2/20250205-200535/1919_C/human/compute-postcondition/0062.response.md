Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly the fourth element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is not less than `lit[3]`, `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[2]`, or the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[2]` and `a[-1] >= lit[2]`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, and `b` may contain an additional element `lit[3]` if `a[-1] < lit[3]`. `i` is 3, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.***
