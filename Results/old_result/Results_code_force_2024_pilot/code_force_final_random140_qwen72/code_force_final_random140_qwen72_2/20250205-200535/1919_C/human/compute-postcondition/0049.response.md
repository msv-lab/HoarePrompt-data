To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start at 1, as specified by the `range(1, n)`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) (unchanged)
- `_` is 1 (unchanged)
- `n` must be greater than 1 (adjusted)
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input (unchanged)
- `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit` (unchanged)
- `b` is an empty list (unchanged)
- `cp` is 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (adjusted)
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element (unchanged)

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element**
