Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of `lit` to the list `b`.
- Initially, `b` was an empty list, so after appending, `b` contains the element at index `i` of `lit`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
