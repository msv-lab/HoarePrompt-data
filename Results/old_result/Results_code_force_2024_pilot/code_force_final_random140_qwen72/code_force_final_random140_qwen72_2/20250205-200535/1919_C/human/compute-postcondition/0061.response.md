The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` remains 1.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input.
- `a` initially contains the first element of `lit`.
- `b` is determined based on the condition `a[-1] < lit[2]`:
  - If `a[-1] < lit[2]`, `b` contains the second and third elements of `lit`.
  - Otherwise, `a` contains the first and third elements of `lit`, and `b` contains the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[2]`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`.
- `i` is 3.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

After executing `a.append(lit[i])`:
- The list `a` now contains the first element of `lit` followed by the element at index `i` (which is 3) of `lit`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`.
- `b` is determined based on the condition `a[-1] < lit[2]` as described above.
- `i` is 3.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is determined based on the condition `a[-1] < lit[2]` as described above, `i` is 3, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**
