The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given that `n` is already a positive integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 1 as specified in the loop definition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1**
