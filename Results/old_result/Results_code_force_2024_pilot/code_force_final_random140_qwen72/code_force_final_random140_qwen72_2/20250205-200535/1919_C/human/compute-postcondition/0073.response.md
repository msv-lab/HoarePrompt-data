Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `s` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `s` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 0.
- The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1.
- If `s` was initially 0, it becomes 1.
- If `s` was initially 2, it becomes 3.
- Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, we assume the worst-case scenario where `s` is 0 (as no information suggests otherwise).
- Therefore, `s` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
