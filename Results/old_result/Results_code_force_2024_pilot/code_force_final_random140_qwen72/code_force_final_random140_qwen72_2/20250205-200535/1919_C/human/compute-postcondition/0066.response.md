Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]`.**
