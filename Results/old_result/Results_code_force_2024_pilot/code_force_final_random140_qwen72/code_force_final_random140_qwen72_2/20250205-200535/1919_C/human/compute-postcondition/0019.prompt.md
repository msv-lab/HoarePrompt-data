Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is either a list containing the second element of `lit` or remains empty, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` contains the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains both the first and the second elements of `lit`, and `b` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` contains the second and third elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and the element at index `i` (which is 2) of `lit`, and `b` remains either a list containing the second element of `lit` or remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3. If the last element of `a` (which is the element at index 2 of `lit`) is less than the element at index 3 of `lit`, then `a` contains the first and the element at index 2 of `lit`, and `b` contains the second and the element at index 3 of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains the first, the element at index 2, and the element at index 3 of `lit`, and `b` contains the second element of `lit`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
