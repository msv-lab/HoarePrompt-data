Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and the element at index `i` (which is 2) of `lit`, `b` is either a list containing the second element of `lit` or remains empty, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2.** 

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of the list `lit` to the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition about the last element of `a` being less than the element at index `i` in `lit` does not affect the current operation, so `b` retains its previous state (either containing the second element of `lit` or remaining empty).
