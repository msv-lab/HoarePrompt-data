Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element, and the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`.**
