Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and the fourth element of `lit`, `b` is a list (possibly containing elements from `lit`), `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `cp` is 0, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the fourth element of the list `lit` (since `i` is 3) to the list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
