Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`. If `a[-1] < lit[i]`, then `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit`, `i` is 2, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`, `b` is either a list containing the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` (which is now the third element of `lit`) is less than the `i`-th element of `lit`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the `i`-th element of `lit`, `i` is 2, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**
