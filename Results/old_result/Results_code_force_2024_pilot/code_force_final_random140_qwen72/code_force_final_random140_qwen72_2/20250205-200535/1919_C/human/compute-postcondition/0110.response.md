Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison, `s` is 0, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]`.**
