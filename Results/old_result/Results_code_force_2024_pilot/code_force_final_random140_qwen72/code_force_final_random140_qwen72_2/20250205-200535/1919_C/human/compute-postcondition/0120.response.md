To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i` is the loop variable.
   - `b` is the list whose length determines the range of the loop.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(1, len(b))` generates a sequence of numbers. This means `len(b)` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `len(b)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state of `i` is not relevant to the loop head, but it will be set to 1 when the loop starts.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`
- `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `len(a)` is the final length of `a`

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `b` must have at least 2 elements (`len(b) > 1`).
- The loop variable `i` will be set to 1 when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison and must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `len(a)` is the final length of `a`**
