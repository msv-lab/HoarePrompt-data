Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and `lit[i]`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the `i`-th element of `lit` to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contained only the first element of `lit`. After appending `lit[i]`, `a` now contains both the first element of `lit` and `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` is still valid.
