Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly the fourth element of `lit` depending on the condition, `b` is a list (possibly containing elements from `lit`), `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `cp` is 0, and `i` is 3. If `a[-1] < lit[i]`, then `a` contains the first and fourth elements of `lit`, and `b` contains the first and fourth elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains the first and fourth elements of `lit`, and `b` remains unchanged.***
