To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

- The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`.
- The variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`.
- `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison and must have at least 2 elements.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `len(a)` is the final length of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop variable `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop condition `i < len(b)` must still hold true.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `b` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- `b` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `len(a)` is the final length of `a`.**
