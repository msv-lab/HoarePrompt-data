Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, indicating the length of the list `lit`.
- The list `lit` remains unchanged as it was initially read from input.
- The list `a` starts with the first element of `lit` and includes all subsequent elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a` at each step.
- The list `b` contains all elements from `lit` that were found to be greater than the last element of `a` at each step.
- The variable `cp` remains 0.
- The loop index `i` reaches `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `lit` that was processed.
