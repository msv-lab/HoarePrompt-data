To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`.
- `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison.
- `s` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` remains 0.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `len(a)` is greater than 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a` starting from 1 up to `len(a) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < len(a)` must still hold true.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The length of `a` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison, `s` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` remains 0, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, and `len(a)` is greater than 3.**
