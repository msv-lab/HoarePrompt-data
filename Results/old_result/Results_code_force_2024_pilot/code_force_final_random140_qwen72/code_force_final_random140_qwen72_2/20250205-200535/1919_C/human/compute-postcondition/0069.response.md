To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

Given:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 1
- `n` is the same as the initial input integer
- `lit` is the same list of integers read from input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements
- `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 1
- If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0

Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a` starting from 1 up to `len(a) - 1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- The length of `a` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

State:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
