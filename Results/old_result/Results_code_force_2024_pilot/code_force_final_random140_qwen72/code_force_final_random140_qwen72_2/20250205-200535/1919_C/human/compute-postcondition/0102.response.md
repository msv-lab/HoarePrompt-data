Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`. If `a[-1] < lit[i]`, then `b` now contains the element at index `i` of `lit`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. Otherwise, `a` includes the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` remains an empty list, `cp` is 0, and `i` is 2.**
