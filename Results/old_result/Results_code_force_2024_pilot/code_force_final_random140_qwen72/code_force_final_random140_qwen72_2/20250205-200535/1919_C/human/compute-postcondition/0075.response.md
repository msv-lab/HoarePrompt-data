Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. The variable `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `a` starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element (index `len(a) - 1`).
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the current element `a[i]` is greater than the previous element `a[i - 1]`.
- If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, the counter `s` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `s` will contain the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.
- The index `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
