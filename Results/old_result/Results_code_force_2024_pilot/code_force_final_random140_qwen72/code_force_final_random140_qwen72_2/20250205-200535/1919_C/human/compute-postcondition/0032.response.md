To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

1. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to but not including the length of `b`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(b)` must be greater than 1.
2. The variable `i` is not explicitly set in the state before the loop, but it is defined in the loop head as part of the range.

Given this, the state adjustments needed are:

- `b` must be a list with at least 2 elements for the loop to execute at least once.
- `i` is implicitly set by the loop and starts at 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `b` has at least 2 elements. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `i`, `s`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly involved in the loop head condition.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b` and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element**
