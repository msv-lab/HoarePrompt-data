The code initializes the list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` (which is 0), and `j` is `n`.**
