You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases processed. For each test case, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of integers input by the user. The variable `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the loop prints 0 for that test case. Otherwise, the loop checks each integer from 1 to `n` inclusive. If any integer `j` in the range 1 to `n` has a count less than 2, and either its count is 0 or `c` (which is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`) becomes 0, the loop breaks early and prints the value of `j`. If no such integer is found, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything. The loop iterates through all `t` test cases, and the final state of `t` is 0, indicating all test cases have been processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX value is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Initial MEX Value**:
   - The program checks if `cntl[0] == 0` and immediately prints `0` if true. This is incorrect because the MEX value could still be greater than 0 even if `0` is not present in the array. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the MEX value is `0`, but the program would incorrectly print `0` without considering the rest of the elements.

2. **Flawed Logic for Determining MEX**:
   - The program uses a variable `c` initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])` and decrements it as it iterates through the array. This logic is not correct for determining the MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c`.

3. **Incorrect Break Condition**:
   - The program breaks out of the loop when it finds a `j` such that `cntl[j] == 0` or when `c` becomes `0`. This does not guarantee that the MEX value is correctly determined. For example, consider the array `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`. The correct MEX value is `3`, but the program might incorrectly print `2` or `1` depending on the values of `c`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 1 1 2 2
```
The correct output should be `3` because the MEX value of the array `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2]` is `3`. However, the program will incorrectly print `2` or `1` due to the flawed logic.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the MEX value, the program should:
1. Count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. Iterate through the non-negative integers starting from `0` and find the smallest integer that is not present in the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] == 0:
                mex = j
                break
        print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly determines the MEX value for the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
