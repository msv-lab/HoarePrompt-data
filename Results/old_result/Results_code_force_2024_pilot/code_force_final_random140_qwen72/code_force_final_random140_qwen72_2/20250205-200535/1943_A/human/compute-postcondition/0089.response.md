Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is incremented by the length of list `a`. This does not affect the value of `j` directly.
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. This is a constraint but does not directly affect the value of `j`.
   - `n` must be at least 1. This is a constraint but does not directly affect the value of `j`.
   - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. This is used to construct the `cntl` list.
   - `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
   - `j` is set to `n`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. This means there is at least one occurrence of 0 in the list `a`.
   - `c` is the minimum of 0 and `cntl[0] - 1`. Since `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` will be 0 if `cntl[0]` is 1, or it will be `cntl[0] - 1` if `cntl[0]` is greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `j`:**
   - According to the initial state, `j` is set to `n`.
   - `n` must be at least 1, so `j` will be at least 1.

Therefore, the value of `j` is `n`, and since `n` is at least 1, the output will be the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the value of n, which is at least 1)**
