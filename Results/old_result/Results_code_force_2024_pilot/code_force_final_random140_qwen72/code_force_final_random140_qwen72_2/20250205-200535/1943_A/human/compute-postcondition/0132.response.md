Postcondition: ***`a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program checks if `cntl[j]` is 0. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is set to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`. If `c` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 0, the program continues as normal.***
