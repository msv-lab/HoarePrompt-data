Postcondition: **_ is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` (i.e., `cntl[0]`) is 0, indicating that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`.**
