The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element of `a`.

State: **`a` is a new list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1**
