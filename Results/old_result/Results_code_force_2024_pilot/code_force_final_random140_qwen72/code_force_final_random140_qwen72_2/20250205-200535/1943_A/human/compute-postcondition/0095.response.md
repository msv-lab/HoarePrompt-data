Postcondition: **_ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, and `j` is `n`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 0 and `cntl[0] - (number of times `c` was decremented)`, and `j` is 0.**
