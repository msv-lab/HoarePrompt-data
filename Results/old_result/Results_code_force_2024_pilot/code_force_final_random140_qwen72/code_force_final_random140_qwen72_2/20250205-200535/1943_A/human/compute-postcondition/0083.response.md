Postcondition: **_ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`, and if `c` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
