Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is set to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2 but not equal to 0.
   - `c` is currently 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly stated to be 1 in the initial state.
   - The value of `j` does not change between the initial state and the execution of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
