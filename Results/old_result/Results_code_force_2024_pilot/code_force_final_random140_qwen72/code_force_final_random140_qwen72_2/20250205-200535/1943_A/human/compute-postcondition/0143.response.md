Postcondition: ***After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, and for each element `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The length of `cntl` remains `n + 1`, and the other variables (`t`, `j`, `c`) remain unchanged. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program continues with the updated `cntl` array. Otherwise, the loop will terminate when either a value `j` is found such that `cntl[j]` is 0, or `c` reaches 0. In both cases, the loop will print the current value of `j` and break. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `j` will be equal to `n + 1`, and `c` will be the result of subtracting the number of times `cntl[j]` was 1 from the initial value of `c`. The values of `a`, `cntl`, and `n` remain unchanged, except for the changes to `c` and `j` as described.***
