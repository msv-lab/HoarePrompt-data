To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n + 1)` is not empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, `n + 1` must be greater than 1, which means `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - The state of `n` must be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - The state of `j` is automatically managed by the loop, starting from 1 and incrementing up to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.
- The initial value of `j` is 1.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1**
