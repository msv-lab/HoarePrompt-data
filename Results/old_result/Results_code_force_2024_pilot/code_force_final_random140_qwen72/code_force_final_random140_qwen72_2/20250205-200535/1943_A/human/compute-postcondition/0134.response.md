Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `n` is greater than 2.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(j)
```

Explanation:
- The variable `j` is explicitly set to 3.
- The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
