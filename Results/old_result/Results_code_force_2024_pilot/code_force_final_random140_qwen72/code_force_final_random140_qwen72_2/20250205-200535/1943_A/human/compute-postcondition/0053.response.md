The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (unchanged from the initial state).
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 (unchanged from the initial state).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged from the initial state).
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element (unchanged from the initial state).
- `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element is 0 (unchanged except for the element at index `i`).
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` (which is 0) (unchanged from the initial state).
- `j` is `n` (unchanged from the initial state).

Since `i` is not specified in the initial state, we assume it is a valid index within the range of `cntl`. Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i`.

The value at index `i` in `cntl` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cntl[i]` is 0, so after the increment, `cntl[i]` becomes 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 1, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` (which is 0), and `j` is `n`.**
