The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `j` is 3), and `n` must still be such that `j < n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is 3**
