To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `i` and the list `a`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
2. **List `a`:** For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 0 and `cntl[0] - (number of times `c` was decremented).

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`a` is a new list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`**.
