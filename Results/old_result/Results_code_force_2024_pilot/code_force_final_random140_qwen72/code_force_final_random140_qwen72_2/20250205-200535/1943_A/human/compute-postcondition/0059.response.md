Postcondition: **_ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` (which is 0), `j` is `n`, and `cntl[0]` is 0.**
