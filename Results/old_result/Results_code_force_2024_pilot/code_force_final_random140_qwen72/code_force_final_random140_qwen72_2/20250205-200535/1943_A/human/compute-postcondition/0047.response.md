Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it indicates that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the loop has completed all iterations, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is `n`. The loop has checked each integer from 1 to `n` inclusive. If any integer `j` in the range 1 to `n` had a count less than 2, and either its count was 0 or `c` became 0, the loop broke early and printed the value of `j`. If no such integer was found, the loop completed all iterations without printing anything.***
