To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers. This happens if `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the Given Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `s` is the last input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1'.
   - `a` is 0.
   - `b` is an empty string.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `j` is not used outside the loop head, it will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 0.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` remains an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` will be initialized to 0 by the loop.
- `s` remains the last input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1'.
- `a` remains 0.
- `b` remains an empty string.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the last input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
