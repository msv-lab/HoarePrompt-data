The function reads multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid contains a shape (either a triangle or a square) that includes all the '1's. Specifically, if any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', it prints 'Triangle'. If any row contains more than one '1', it prints 'Square'. If no row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', it defaults to printing 'Square'. The function processes up to 100 test cases, with each grid being up to 10x10 in size.
