Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is 0. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = 0` sets the variable `a` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for `a` being 'Triangle' or remaining 0 is not affected by the code snippet, so it remains as described in the initial state.
- The condition for `b` being 'Square' or remaining an empty string is also not affected by the code snippet, so it remains as described in the initial state.
