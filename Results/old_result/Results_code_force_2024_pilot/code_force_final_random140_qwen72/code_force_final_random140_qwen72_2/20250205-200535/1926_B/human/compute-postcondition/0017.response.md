The code assigns the string `'Square'` to the variable `b`. This overrides the initial condition for `b`, which was dependent on the count of '1' in the string `s`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 0 if the count of '1' in `s` is 0 or greater than 1, otherwise `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is 'Square'.**
