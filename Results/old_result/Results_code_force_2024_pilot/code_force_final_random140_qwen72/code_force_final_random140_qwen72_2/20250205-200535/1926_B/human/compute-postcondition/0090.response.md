Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the last input string.
- `a` is set to 'Triangle' because at least one input string contained exactly one '1'.
- `b` remains an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square'.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`.

Given that `a` is explicitly set to 'Triangle' because at least one input string contained exactly one '1', the value of `a` is 'Triangle'.

Therefore, the output of the `print(a)` statement is:

Output: **Triangle**
