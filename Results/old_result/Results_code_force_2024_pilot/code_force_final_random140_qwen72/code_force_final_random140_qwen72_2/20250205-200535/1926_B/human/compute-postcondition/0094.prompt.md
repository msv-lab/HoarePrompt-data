Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'Triangle'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'Square'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. If any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string. If `a` is not 0, `b` remains an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square'. If `a` is 0, `a` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
