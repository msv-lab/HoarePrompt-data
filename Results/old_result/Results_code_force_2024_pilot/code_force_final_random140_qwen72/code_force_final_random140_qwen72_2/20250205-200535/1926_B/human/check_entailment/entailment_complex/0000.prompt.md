Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'Triangle'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'Square'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. For each test case, if any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string. If `a` is not 0, `b` remains an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square'. If `a` is 0, `a` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid contains a shape (either a triangle or a square) that includes all the '1's. Specifically, if any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', it prints 'Triangle'. If any row contains more than one '1', it prints 'Square'. If no row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', it defaults to printing 'Square'. The function processes up to 100 test cases, with each grid being up to 10x10 in size.
