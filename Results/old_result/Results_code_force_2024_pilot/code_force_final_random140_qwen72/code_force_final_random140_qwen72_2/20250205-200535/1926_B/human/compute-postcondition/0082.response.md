The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the new input string, `j` is 2. If `s.count('1') == 1`, then `a` is set to 'Triangle' and `b` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1') > 1`, then `b` is set to 'Square' and `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
