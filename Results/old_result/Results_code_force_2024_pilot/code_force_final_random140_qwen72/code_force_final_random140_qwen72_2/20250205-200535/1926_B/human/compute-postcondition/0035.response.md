Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is 0. `b` is an empty string.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `b = ''` resets the value of `b` to an empty string, overriding any previous value. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
