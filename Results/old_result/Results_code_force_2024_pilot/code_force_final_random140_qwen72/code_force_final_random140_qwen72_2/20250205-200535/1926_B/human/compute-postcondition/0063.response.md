The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.**
