The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the problem description, it implicitly accepts multiple inputs through some mechanism (e.g., standard input, file, etc.). These inputs include:

- An integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid.
- A grid of size `n x n` represented by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').

The function processes each test case and determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, with the constraint that the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of '0's and '1's. It returns whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, ensuring the shape does not consist of exactly one '1'.**
