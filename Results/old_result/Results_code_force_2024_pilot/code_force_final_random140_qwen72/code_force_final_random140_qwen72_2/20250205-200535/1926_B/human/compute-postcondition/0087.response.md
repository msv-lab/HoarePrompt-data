Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the new input string, `j` is 2. If `s.count('1') == 1`, `a` is set to 'Triangle' and `b` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1') > 1`, `b` is set to 'Square' and `a` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1') != 1` and `s.count('1') <= 1`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
