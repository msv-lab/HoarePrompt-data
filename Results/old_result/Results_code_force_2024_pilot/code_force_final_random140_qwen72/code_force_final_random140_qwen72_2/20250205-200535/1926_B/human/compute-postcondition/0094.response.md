Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. For each test case, if any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string. If `a` is not 0, `b` remains an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square'. If `a` is 0, `a` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations, `i` will be `t-1` because the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`.
- `n` will be the last input integer for the final test case.
- `j` will be `n-1` because the inner loop runs from 0 to `n-1`.
- `s` will be the last input string for the final test case.
- For each test case, the variables `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions within the loop:
  - If any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'.
  - If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'.
  - If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.
  - If `a` is not 0, `b` remains an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square'.
  - If `a` is 0, `a` remains 0.
