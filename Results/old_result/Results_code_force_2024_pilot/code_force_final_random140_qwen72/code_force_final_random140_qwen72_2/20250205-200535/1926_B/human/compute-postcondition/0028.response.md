Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the last input string.
- `a` is 'Triangle' because at least one input string contained exactly one '1'.
- `b` is either 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1', or an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is explicitly stated to be 'Triangle' because at least one input string contained exactly one '1'.
- Therefore, the value of `a` is 'Triangle'.

### Output:
Output: **Triangle**
