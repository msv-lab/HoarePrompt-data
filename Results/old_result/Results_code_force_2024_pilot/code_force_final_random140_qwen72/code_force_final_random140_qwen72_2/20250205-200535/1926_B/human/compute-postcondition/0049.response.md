Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the new input string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, if `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains no '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.***
