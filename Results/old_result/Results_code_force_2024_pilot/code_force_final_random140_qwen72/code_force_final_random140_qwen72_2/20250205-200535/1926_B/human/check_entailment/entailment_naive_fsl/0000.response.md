Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes in all cases. Specifically, the program only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to identify a triangle and more than one '1' to identify a square. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Triangles with more than one '1' per row**: A triangle can have rows with more than one '1', especially as the triangle grows larger. For example, a triangle with `k=3` will have rows like `1`, `111`, and `111`. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square.

2. **Squares with exactly one '1' per row**: A square can have rows with exactly one '1' if the square is very small. For example, a 2x2 square with `11` and `11` would be incorrectly identified as a triangle.

3. **Upside-down triangles**: The program does not account for upside-down triangles, which are also valid according to the problem description.

4. **Central alignment of '1's in triangles**: The program does not check if the '1's in a triangle are centrally aligned, which is a requirement for a valid triangle.

To correctly identify the shapes, the program needs to implement more sophisticated logic to check the structure of the '1's in the grid, ensuring they form either a valid triangle or a valid square.
