### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads each row of the grid as a string.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row, it counts the number of '1's in the row using `s.count('1')`.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'Triangle'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'Square'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., a triangle was detected), it prints 'Triangle'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Square'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Triangle Detection**:
  - The logic for detecting a triangle is flawed. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, especially in the middle rows. The current logic only checks if a row has exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to identify a triangle.
  - For example, a valid triangle can have rows like "001", "0111", "11111". The current logic would miss this and incorrectly identify it as a square.
- **Overwriting Variables**:
  - The variables `a` and `b` are overwritten in each iteration of the loop. This means that if a row with more than one '1' appears after a row with exactly one '1', the function will incorrectly identify the shape as a square.
- **No Check for Valid Shapes**:
  - The function does not check if the detected shape forms a valid triangle or square according to the problem description. For example, it does not verify that the '1's form a continuous pattern that matches the definition of a triangle or a square.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately detect the shape based on the problem's requirements. The logic for identifying triangles and squares is flawed, and it does not handle the problem constraints correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
