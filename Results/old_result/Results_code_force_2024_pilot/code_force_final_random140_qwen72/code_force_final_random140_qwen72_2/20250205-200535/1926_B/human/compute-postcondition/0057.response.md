Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle'. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If no input string contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0. If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the new input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`s`**: After the loop completes, `s` will be the last input string provided during the last iteration of the loop.
- **`a`**: If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` will be set to 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0.
- **`b`**: If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` will be set to 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.
