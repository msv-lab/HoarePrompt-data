You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''

            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:

            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'Square'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid contains a shape (either a triangle or a square) that includes all the '1's. Specifically, if any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', it prints 'Triangle'. If any row contains more than one '1', it prints 'Square'. If no row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', it defaults to printing 'Square'. The function processes up to 100 test cases, with each grid being up to 10x10 in size.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads each row of the grid as a string.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row, it counts the number of '1's in the row using `s.count('1')`.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'Triangle'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'Square'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., a triangle was detected), it prints 'Triangle'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Square'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Triangle Detection**: The logic for detecting a triangle is flawed. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, especially in the middle rows. The current logic only checks if a row has exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to identify a triangle.
- **Overwriting Variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are overwritten in each iteration of the loop. This means that if a row with more than one '1' appears after a row with exactly one '1', the function will incorrectly identify the shape as a square.
- **No Check for Valid Shapes**: The function does not check if the detected shape forms a valid triangle or square according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately detect the shape based on the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**False**
