Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the last input string.
- No input string contained exactly one '1', so `a` remains 0.
- If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'.
- If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.

Given these conditions, the `print(b)` statement will print the value of `b`.

Since it is stated that no input string contained exactly one '1', but it does not specify whether any input string contained more than one '1', we need to consider both possibilities:

1. If any input string contained more than one '1', then `b` is 'Square'.
2. If no input string contained more than one '1', then `b` remains an empty string.

However, the precondition explicitly states that if no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string. Since there is no information suggesting that any input string contained more than one '1', we can conclude that `b` remains an empty string.

Therefore, the output of the `print(b)` statement will be:

Output: **'' (an empty string)**
