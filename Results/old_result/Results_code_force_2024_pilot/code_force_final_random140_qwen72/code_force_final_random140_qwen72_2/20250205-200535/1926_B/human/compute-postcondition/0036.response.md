To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers. This happens if `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `j` will start at 0 (the default starting value for `range`).

4. **Review the Given State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `s` is the last input string.
   - If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is 0.
   - `b` is an empty string.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `j` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `s` is the last input string.
- If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is 0.
- `b` is an empty string.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is the last input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1' then `a` is 0 otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string**
