You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid contains a shape (either a triangle or a square) that includes all the '1's. Specifically, if any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', it prints 'Triangle'. If any row contains more than one '1', it prints 'Square'. If no row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', it defaults to printing 'Square'. The function processes up to 100 test cases, with each grid being up to 10x10 in size.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes in all cases. Specifically, the program only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to identify a triangle and more than one '1' to identify a square. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Triangles with more than one '1' per row**: A triangle can have rows with more than one '1', especially as the triangle grows larger. For example, a triangle with `k=3` will have rows like `1`, `111`, and `111`. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square.

2. **Squares with exactly one '1' per row**: A square can have rows with exactly one '1' if the square is very small. For example, a 2x2 square with `11` and `11` would be incorrectly identified as a triangle.

3. **Upside-down triangles**: The program does not account for upside-down triangles, which are also valid according to the problem description.

4. **Central alignment of '1's in triangles**: The program does not check if the '1's in a triangle are centrally aligned, which is a requirement for a valid triangle.

To correctly identify the shapes, the program needs to implement more sophisticated logic to check the structure of the '1's in the grid, ensuring they form either a valid triangle or a valid square.
