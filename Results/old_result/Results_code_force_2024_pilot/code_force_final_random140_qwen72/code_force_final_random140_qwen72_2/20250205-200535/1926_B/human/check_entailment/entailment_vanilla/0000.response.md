### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads each row of the grid as a string.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row, it counts the number of '1's in the row using `s.count('1')`.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'Triangle'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'Square'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., a triangle was detected), it prints 'Triangle'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Square'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Triangle Detection**: The logic for detecting a triangle is flawed. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, especially in the middle rows. The current logic only checks if a row has exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to identify a triangle.
- **Overwriting Variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are overwritten in each iteration of the loop. This means that if a row with more than one '1' appears after a row with exactly one '1', the function will incorrectly identify the shape as a square.
- **No Check for Valid Shapes**: The function does not check if the detected shape forms a valid triangle or square according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately detect the shape based on the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**False**
