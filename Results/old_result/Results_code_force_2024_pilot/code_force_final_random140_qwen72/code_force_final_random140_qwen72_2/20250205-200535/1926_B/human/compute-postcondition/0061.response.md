Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `s` is the last input string.
   - No input string contained exactly one '1', so `a` remains 0.
   - If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'.
   - If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.

2. **Determine the value of `b`:**
   - The condition states that if no input string contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0. This condition is met.
   - The condition also states that if any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.
   - Since the problem does not specify that any input string contained more than one '1', we assume that no input string contained more than one '1'.

Therefore, `b` remains an empty string.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(b)`.
   - Since `b` is an empty string, the print statement will output an empty string.

Output: **(an empty string)**
