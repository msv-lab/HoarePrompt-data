The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state describes various conditions and variables (`t`, `_rep`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `k`), but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement only prints the string `'Bob'`, the output will be:

Output: **Bob**
