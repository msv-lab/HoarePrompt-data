Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _rep in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n > k:
        print('Bob')
    elif n < k:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_rep` is 0, `a` and `b` remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `n` is greater than `k`, the condition `n > k` holds true. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition `n ≤ k` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_rep is 1, t is greater than 1, a and b remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, n and k are updated to the input integers. If the new n is greater than the new k, the condition n > k holds true. If the new n is less than or equal to the new k, the condition n ≤ k holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_rep is 2, t is greater than 2, a and b remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and n and k are updated to the input integers. If the new n is greater than the new k, the condition n > k holds true. If the new n is less than or equal to the new k, the condition n ≤ k holds true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
