Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The solution simply compares the number of coins `n` and `k` (which should be `a` and `b` as per the problem statement) and decides the winner based on which is larger. However, the game involves strategic decisions about swapping wallets and removing coins, and the outcome depends on the parity of the number of coins and the optimal play strategy, not just the initial comparison of the number of coins.

A correct solution would need to consider the following:
- If both players have the same number of coins, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because the game will end in a draw where both players have no coins left, but since Alice goes first, she will be the one unable to make a move.
- If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can force a win by always swapping when necessary to ensure they never run out of coins first.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This solution correctly determines the winner based on the rules of the game.
