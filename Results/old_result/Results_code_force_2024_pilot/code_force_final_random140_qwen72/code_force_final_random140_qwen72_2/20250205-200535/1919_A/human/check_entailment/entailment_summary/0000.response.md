Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not accurately reflect the rules of the game. According to the game rules, both players have the option to either swap wallets or keep their current wallets, followed by removing one coin from the current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The solution provided simply compares the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and decides the winner based on that comparison alone, which does not account for the strategic elements of the game, such as the ability to swap wallets and the requirement to remove a coin each turn.

For example, in the case where `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the provided solution would incorrectly predict that Bob wins because `a` is not greater than `b`. However, according to the game rules, Alice would be forced to remove a coin from her wallet on her first turn, leaving her with an empty wallet, and thus Bob would win. This specific scenario is correctly handled by the provided solution, but other scenarios are not.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins and the strategic advantage of the first move. If the total number of coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) can always force a win by ensuring that the number of coins in both wallets remains unequal until the end. If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's moves to ensure a win.

Given this, the correct approach would be to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd or even, and determine the winner based on that:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This approach correctly handles all scenarios as per the game rules.

Correctness: **False**
