The only variables in the loop head are `_rep` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `a` and `b` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_rep` is initialized to 0 (as it is a typical behavior of the `range()` function in Python).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_rep` is 0, `a` and `b` remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9**
