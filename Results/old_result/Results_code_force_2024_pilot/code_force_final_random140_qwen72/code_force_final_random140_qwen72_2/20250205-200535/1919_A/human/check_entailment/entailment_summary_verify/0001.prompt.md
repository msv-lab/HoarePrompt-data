You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _rep in range(t):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n > k:
            print('Bob')
        elif n < k:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^9. It then compares `n` and `k` and prints 'Bob' if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 'Alice' if `n` is less than `k`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**: The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their current wallet. They can also choose to swap wallets with their opponent at the start of their turn. The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - If Alice starts with more coins than Bob (`a > b`), she can always force Bob into a position where he has fewer coins. By swapping wallets when necessary, Alice can ensure that Bob is the one who ends up with an empty wallet first.
   - If Bob starts with more coins than Alice (`a < b`), Bob can similarly force Alice into a position where she has fewer coins. By swapping wallets when necessary, Bob can ensure that Alice is the one who ends up with an empty wallet first.
   - If both start with the same number of coins (`a == b`), the game will end in a draw if they both play optimally. However, since the game rules state that the player who cannot make a move loses, and both players will be forced to remove a coin alternately until one of them runs out, the player who makes the last move (i.e., the one who removes the last coin) will lose. Since Alice goes first, she will be the one to run out of moves first if both have the same number of coins.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.
   - It then checks:
     - If `n > k`, it prints "Bob" because Bob will win if Alice has more coins.
     - If `n < k`, it prints "Alice" because Alice will win if Bob has more coins.
     - If `n == k`, it prints "Bob" because Alice will lose if both have the same number of coins.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles all three cases as described above.
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given examples.

Given this analysis, the program is correct.
