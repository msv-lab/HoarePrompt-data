The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are input integers, and their values will be updated based on the input. The other variables (`_rep`, `t`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`_rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers. If the new `n` is greater than the new `k`, the condition `n > k` holds true. If the new `n` is less than or equal to the new `k`, the condition `n ≤ k` holds true.**
