Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only compares the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and decides the winner based on which wallet has more coins. This approach fails to account for the strategic decisions (swapping wallets and removing coins) that can change the outcome of the game.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

- Input: `t = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 4`
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Program Output: `Bob`

According to the problem description, Alice can win this game by swapping wallets with Bob on her first turn, reducing the number of coins in her wallet to 3. Bob will then be forced to reduce his wallet to 3 coins, and Alice can continue to force Bob into a losing position. However, the program incorrectly outputs `Bob` because it only compares the initial values of `a` and `b` without considering the game dynamics.
