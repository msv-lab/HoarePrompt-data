Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_rep` is 2.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
- `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers.
- If the new `n` is greater than the new `k`, the condition `n > k` holds true.
- If the new `n` is less than or equal to the new `k`, the condition `n ≤ k` holds true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables and conditions, but it does not affect the content of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **Alice**
