The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should handle up to 1000 test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, the values of `a` and `b` are within the range 1 to 10^9.

The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically, such a function would return or print a result for each test case, possibly indicating which person has more coins or some other derived value based on `a` and `b`.
