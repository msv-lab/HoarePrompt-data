Based on the initial state provided:

- `_rep` is 1.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
- `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers.
- If the new `n` is greater than the new `k`, the condition `n > k` holds true.
- If the new `n` is less than or equal to the new `k`, the condition `n ≤ k` holds true.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This code simply prints the string `'Bob'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement, as it does not depend on any of those variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Bob**
