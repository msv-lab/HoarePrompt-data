Output State: **_rep is t-1, t is greater than or equal to 1, a and b remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and n and k are updated to the input integers for each iteration. For each iteration, if the current n is greater than the current k, the condition n > k holds true. If the current n is less than or equal to the current k, the condition n ≤ k holds true.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the loop counter `_rep` will be one less than the total number of iterations `t`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variables `n` and `k` are updated with new input values for each iteration, and the conditions for printing 'Bob' or 'Alice' are checked based on these updated values.
