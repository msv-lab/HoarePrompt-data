### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their current wallet. They can also choose to swap wallets with their opponent at the start of their turn.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - If Alice starts with more coins than Bob (`a > b`), she can always force Bob into a position where he has fewer coins. By swapping wallets when necessary, Alice can ensure that Bob is the one who ends up with an empty wallet first.
   - If Bob starts with more coins than Alice (`a < b`), Bob can similarly force Alice into a position where she has fewer coins. By swapping wallets when necessary, Bob can ensure that Alice is the one who ends up with an empty wallet first.
   - If both start with the same number of coins (`a == b`), the game will end in a draw if they both play optimally. However, since the game rules state that the player who cannot make a move loses, and both players will be forced to remove a coin alternately until one of them runs out, the player who makes the last move (i.e., the one who removes the last coin) will lose. Since Alice goes first, she will be the one to run out of moves first if both have the same number of coins.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.
   - It then checks:
     - If `n > k`, it prints "Bob" because Bob will win if Alice has more coins.
     - If `n < k`, it prints "Alice" because Alice will win if Bob has more coins.
     - If `n == k`, it prints "Bob" because Alice will lose if both have the same number of coins.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles all three cases as described above.
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given examples.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic:
- When `n == k`, the program incorrectly prints "Bob". According to the game mechanics, if both players have the same number of coins, the player who goes first (Alice) will be the one to run out of moves first and thus lose. Therefore, the correct output should be "Alice" when `n == k`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **inaccurate** because it does not account for the correct outcome when `n == k`.

Final: **False**
