### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves a binary search over possible values of \( x \) and a depth-first search (DFS) to verify if a given \( x \) is feasible.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Constructs an adjacency list `g` from the edges.
     - Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that the `check` function returns `True`.
     - The binary search range is from 1 to \( n // k + 1 \).
     - Prints the result of the binary search.
   - **`dfs`**:
     - Performs a DFS to count the number of vertices in the current component and the number of sub-components of size at least \( y \).
     - Returns a tuple `(c, r)` where `c` is the total count of vertices in the component and `r` is the count of sub-components of size at least \( y \).
   - **`check`**:
     - Clears the `visited` set.
     - Calls `dfs` starting from vertex 1 with the given \( x \).
     - Returns `True` if the number of sub-components of size at least \( x \) is at least \( k \) and the main component size is at least \( x \).

3. **Verification**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` ensures that we efficiently find the maximum \( x \).
   - The `dfs` function correctly counts the vertices and sub-components, ensuring that the `check` function can accurately determine if a given \( x \) is feasible.
   - The `check` function correctly uses the results from `dfs` to decide if the conditions are met.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - The binary search range and the DFS logic ensure that the program works for various tree structures and values of \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem as described. The binary search and DFS are used appropriately to find the maximum \( x \) such that the conditions are met.

**Correctness: **True****
