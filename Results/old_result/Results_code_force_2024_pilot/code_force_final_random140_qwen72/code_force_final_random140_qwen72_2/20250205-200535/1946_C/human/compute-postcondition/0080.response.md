Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it and must contain at least two elements (the original tuple and the new one), `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, `tree.vertices[v].children` must be a non-empty list, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
