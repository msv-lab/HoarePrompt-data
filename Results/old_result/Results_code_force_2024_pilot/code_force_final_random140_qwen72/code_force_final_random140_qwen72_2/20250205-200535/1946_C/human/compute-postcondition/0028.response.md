Output State: **The program returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` is the sum of all `ans` values that were less than `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`. `r` is the sum of all `rn` values returned by the `dfs` function calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`.**
