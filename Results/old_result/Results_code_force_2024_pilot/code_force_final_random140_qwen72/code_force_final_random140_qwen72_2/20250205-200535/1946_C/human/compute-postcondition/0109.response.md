Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a `Tree` object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and a positive integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals. It processes the tree to identify components that meet the specified criteria and calculates the sizes of these components. The function returns two values: `good_components[s]`, which represents the number of components that meet the criteria rooted at vertex `s`, and `remaining_size[s]`, which represents the total size of the remaining components after processing the tree. **
