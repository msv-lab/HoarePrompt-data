The function `func_4` takes a tree structure `tree`, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer `k` (1 â‰¤ k < n) representing the number of edges to be removed. It returns the largest integer `x` such that the function `func_3(tree, n, k, x)` returns `True`. After the function concludes, the input tree and its parameters remain unchanged, and the returned value is the largest valid `x` as described.
