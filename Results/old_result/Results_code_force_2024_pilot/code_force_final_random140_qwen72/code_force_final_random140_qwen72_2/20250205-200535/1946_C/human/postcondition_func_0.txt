The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, representing the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then uses a binary search to find the maximum number of connected components that can be formed by removing `k` edges. It prints the number of connected components minus one, which is the largest value for which the `check` function returns `False`. The function does not return any value.
