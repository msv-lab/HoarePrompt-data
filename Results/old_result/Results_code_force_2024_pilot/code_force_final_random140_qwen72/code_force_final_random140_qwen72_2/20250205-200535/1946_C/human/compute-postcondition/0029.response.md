The function `dfs` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `g`, and `visited`. `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, where `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, and `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components. `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search.

The function returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` is the sum of all `ans` values that were less than `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`. `r` is the sum of all `rn` values returned by the `dfs` function calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`.

Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts parameters `x`, `y`, `g`, and `visited`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree, and `visited` is a set of visited vertices. It returns two values: `c`, which is the sum of all `ans` values less than `y` for unvisited nodes in `g[x]`, and `r`, which is the sum of all `rn` values from recursive `dfs` calls plus the count of `ans` values greater than or equal to `y` for unvisited nodes in `g[x]`.**
