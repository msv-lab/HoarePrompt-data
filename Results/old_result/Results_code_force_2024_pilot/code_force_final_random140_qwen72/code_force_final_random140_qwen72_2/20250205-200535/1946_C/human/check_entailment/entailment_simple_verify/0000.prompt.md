You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Variable Scope and Initialization**: The `g` and `visited` variables are used in multiple functions but are not properly initialized or scoped. Specifically, `g` is defined in `func_1` but used in `dfs` and `check` without being passed as a parameter. Similarly, `visited` is used in `dfs` and `check` but is not properly reset or passed between functions.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is not correctly implemented. The `check` function is called within the binary search loop, but the `l` and `r` variables are not updated correctly. The condition `if check(mid):` should update `l` to `mid + 1` if the condition is true, but the current implementation updates `l` to `mid`, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is supposed to traverse the tree and count the number of nodes in each component. However, the logic for counting the number of components (`r`) and the total number of nodes in each component (`c`) is not clear and may not handle all edge cases correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is very close to `n` or when the tree is a star graph (one central node connected to all other nodes).

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `k = 2`, `edges = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: The program may not correctly handle this case due to the issues mentioned above.

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
