Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and for each tuple (a, b) in `edges`, `g[a]` contains `b` and `g[b]` contains `a`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `mid` is `l + (r - l) // 2`. If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
