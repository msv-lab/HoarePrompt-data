Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, and `postorder` is true. If `postorder` is true, `tree.vertices[v].children` will have been fully processed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` will be increased by `good_components[u]`. Additionally, for each child `u` where `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` will be further incremented by 1. For each child `u` where `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` will be increased by `remaining_size[u]`. The final values of `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` will reflect these updates based on all the children of `v`. If `postorder` is false, no changes are made to `good_components` or `remaining_size`.***
