The function `check` takes a positive integer `x` as input, which represents the minimum size of connected components after removing `k` edges from a graph. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph and determine if there exists a connected component of size at least `x` after removing `k` edges. If such a component exists, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function executes, the `visited` set is cleared, and the function has no side effects on other variables.
