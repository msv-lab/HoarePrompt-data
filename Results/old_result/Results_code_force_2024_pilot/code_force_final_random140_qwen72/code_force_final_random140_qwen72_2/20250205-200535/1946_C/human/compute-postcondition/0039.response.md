Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value.**

Explanation:
- The code `v, postorder = stack.pop()` pops the top element from the `stack` and assigns the first element of the tuple to `v` and the second element to `postorder`.
- The `stack` is updated to reflect the removal of the top element.
- The values of `tree`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The values of `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged, except for the key `v` which is now the value popped from `stack`.
