Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element and now includes `(v, True)` at the end, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `v` has at least one child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` in addition to its previous contents.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `v` has at least two children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to its previous contents, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `v` has at least three children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended twice to its previous contents, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
