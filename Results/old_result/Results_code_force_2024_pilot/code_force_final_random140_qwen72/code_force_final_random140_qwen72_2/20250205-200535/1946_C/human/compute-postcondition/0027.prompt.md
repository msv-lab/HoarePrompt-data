Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x and y are non-negative integers, where x represents a vertex in the graph g, and y is a threshold value for the size of the connected components. g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and visited is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including x. c is 1, r is 0.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node not in visited:
        ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
        r += rn
        if ans >= y:
            r += 1
        else:
            c += ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element. If `x` is not in the `visited` set, `ans` is the value returned by the `dfs` function, and `rn` is the value returned by the `dfs` function. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `r` is updated to `rn + 1` and `c` remains 1. Otherwise, `r` remains `rn` and `c` is updated to `1 + ans`. If `x` is in the `visited` set, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]`. If `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned from the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`, `r` is increased by `rn`. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, `r` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]`. If `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned from the `dfs` function called with `node` and `y` as arguments, `r` is updated by adding `rn` to its current value. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, `r` is additionally incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is updated by adding `ans` to its current value. If `node` is in `visited`, no changes are made to `r` or `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
