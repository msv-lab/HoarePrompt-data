Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` contains at least three elements, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is now equal to its original value plus `good_components[u]` from the previous iteration plus the current `good_components[u]` plus 1. If `remaining_size[u]` was greater than or equal to `x` in the previous iteration, `good_components[v]` was further incremented by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` was updated to its original value plus `remaining_size[u]` from the previous iteration.**
