### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This is done correctly by iterating over the edges and appending each vertex to the adjacency list of the other vertex.

2. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. This is a reasonable initialization because the maximum possible value for `x` is `n // (k + 1)` since we need to ensure that after removing `k` edges, each component has at least `x` vertices.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The binary search is performed to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining component with at least `x` vertices. The midpoint `mid` is calculated correctly, and the `check` function is used to validate if `mid` is a valid candidate.
   - However, there is a minor issue in the binary search loop. The condition should be `while l < r` instead of `while l <= r` to avoid infinite loops when `l` and `r` converge.

4. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to traverse the tree and count the number of vertices in each subtree. It also counts the number of subtrees (`r`) that can be formed by removing edges.
   - The function correctly updates the `visited` set to avoid revisiting nodes.
   - The function returns a tuple `(c, r)` where `c` is the number of vertices in the current subtree and `r` is the number of subtrees that can be formed by removing edges.
   - There is a potential issue in the `dfs` function where the variable `c` is initialized to 1, which might not be correct if the node itself does not form a valid component of size `x`.

5. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to determine if it is possible to form at least `k` subtrees, each with at least `x` vertices.
   - It clears the `visited` set before starting the DFS to ensure a fresh traversal for each call.
   - The function returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - The `check` function is correctly implemented according to the provided function summary.

6. **Output**:
   - After the binary search completes, the function prints the maximum value of `x` found.
   - The output is correct if the binary search and `check` function are working as intended.

### Conclusion:
The program mostly implements the logic required to solve the problem correctly. However, there are a couple of issues that need to be addressed:
- The binary search loop condition should be `while l < r` to avoid potential infinite loops.
- The `dfs` function should correctly handle the initialization of `c` to ensure it only counts valid components of size `x`.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
