The function `func_5` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5`. It then constructs a tree with `n` nodes by reading `n-1` edges from the input. After constructing the tree, it roots the tree at node 0 and prints the result of calling `func_4` with the tree, `n`, and `k` as arguments. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result of `func_4(tree, n, k)`.
