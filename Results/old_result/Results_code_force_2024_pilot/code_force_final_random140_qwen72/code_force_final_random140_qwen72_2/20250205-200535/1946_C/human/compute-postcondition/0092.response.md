Postcondition: ***`tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, and `good_components[v]` is incremented by `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is further incremented by 1. If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` is incremented by `remaining_size[u]`.***
