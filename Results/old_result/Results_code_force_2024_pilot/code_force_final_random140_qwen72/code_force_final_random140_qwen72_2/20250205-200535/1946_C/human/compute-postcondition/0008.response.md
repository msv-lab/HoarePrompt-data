Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x`, `c` is 1, `r` is now equal to `rn + 1`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, the current node is not in the `visited` set, `ans` is the value returned by the `dfs` function, `rn` is the value returned by the `dfs` function, and `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`.**
