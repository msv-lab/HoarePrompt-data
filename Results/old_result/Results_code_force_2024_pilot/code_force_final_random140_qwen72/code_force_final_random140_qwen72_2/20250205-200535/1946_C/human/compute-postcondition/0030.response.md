Functionality: ** The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from vertex `x` in a graph represented by `g`. It accepts non-negative integers `x` and `y`, a dictionary `g` representing the adjacency list of the graph, and a set `visited` of vertices that have already been visited. The function updates the `visited` set to include all vertices visited during the search. It returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` represents the total count of vertices in the connected component rooted at `x` that do not form a sub-component of size at least `y`. `r` represents the total count of sub-components of size at least `y` found within the connected component rooted at `x`. **
