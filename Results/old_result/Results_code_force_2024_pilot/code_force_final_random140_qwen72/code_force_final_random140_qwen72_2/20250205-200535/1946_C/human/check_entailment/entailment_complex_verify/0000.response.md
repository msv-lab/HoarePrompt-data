### Reasoning:

1. **Variable Scope and Initialization**:
   - The `g` and `visited` variables are indeed used across multiple functions (`func_1`, `dfs`, and `check`). However, the `g` variable is correctly initialized in `func_1` and used in `dfs` and `check` without being passed as a parameter. This is acceptable because `g` is a global variable within the scope of these functions.
   - The `visited` set is also correctly managed. It is cleared at the beginning of each call to `check`, ensuring that it starts fresh for each DFS traversal.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is correctly implemented. The `l` and `r` variables are updated based on the result of the `check` function. If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means that it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `mid` vertices. Therefore, we can try a larger value by setting `l = mid + 1`. If `check(mid)` returns `False`, we need to try a smaller value by setting `r = mid - 1`.
   - The final value of `r` is printed, which is the largest value for which `check(r)` is `True`.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function correctly traverses the tree and counts the number of nodes in each component. The variable `c` keeps track of the total number of nodes in the current component, and `r` keeps track of the number of components that have at least `y` nodes.
   - The logic for updating `c` and `r` is correct. If a sub-component has fewer than `y` nodes, its size is added to `c`. If a sub-component has at least `y` nodes, it is counted as a separate component by incrementing `r`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, in the case of a star graph (one central node connected to all other nodes), the program will correctly determine the maximum number of nodes in each component after removing `k` edges.
   - The program also handles cases where `k` is very close to `n` correctly. The binary search ensures that the maximum possible value of `x` is found.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment identified some potential issues, but upon closer inspection, the program appears to be correctly implemented and handles the problem as described. The binary search and DFS logic are sound, and the variable management is appropriate for the scope of the functions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
