Postcondition: ***`tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.***
