Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The program does not correctly define the `check` function's scope. The `check` function is used within `func_1`, but it relies on global variables like `g` and `visited`, which are defined outside its scope.
- The `dfs` function is also not properly scoped; it uses `g` and `visited` without being passed as arguments.
- The binary search logic in `func_1` is flawed. The variable `r` is initialized to `n // k + 1`, which might not be the correct upper bound for the binary search. The correct upper bound should be `n // (k + 1)` because you need to ensure that after removing `k` edges, each component has at least `x` nodes.
- The `dfs` function does not correctly handle the case where the root node itself is part of a component that needs to be checked against the minimum size `x`.
- The `check` function should ensure that the total number of removed edges is exactly `k`, not just greater than or equal to `k`.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Pass necessary parameters to functions instead of relying on global variables.
- Correctly initialize the binary search bounds.
- Ensure the `dfs` function correctly handles the root node and the `check` function ensures exactly `k` edges are removed.
