### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This is essential for the subsequent operations.

2. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. This initialization is appropriate because the maximum possible value for `x` is `n // (k + 1)` to ensure that after removing `k` edges, each component has at least `x` vertices.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The binary search is performed to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining component with at least `x` vertices. The midpoint `mid` is calculated correctly, and the `check` function is used to validate if `mid` is a valid candidate.
   - The binary search logic is sound and correctly narrows down the range of possible values for `x`.

4. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to traverse the tree and count the number of vertices in each subtree. It also counts the number of subtrees (`r`) that can be formed by removing edges.
   - The function correctly updates the `visited` set to avoid revisiting nodes.
   - The function returns a tuple `(c, r)` where `c` is the number of vertices in the current subtree and `r` is the number of subtrees that can be formed by removing edges.
   - The logic inside the `dfs` function is correct and ensures that the counts are updated appropriately.

5. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to determine if it is possible to form at least `k` subtrees, each with at least `x` vertices.
   - It clears the `visited` set before starting the DFS to ensure a fresh traversal for each call.
   - The function returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - The `check` function correctly validates the conditions required for the problem.

6. **Output**:
   - After the binary search completes, the function prints the maximum value of `x` found.
   - The output is correctly generated based on the binary search results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The graph construction, binary search, DFS, and validation checks are all implemented correctly. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
