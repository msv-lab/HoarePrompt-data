Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]`. If `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned from the `dfs` function called with `node` and `y` as arguments, `r` is updated by adding `rn` to its current value. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, `r` is additionally incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is updated by adding `ans` to its current value. If `node` is in `visited`, no changes are made to `r` or `c`.***
