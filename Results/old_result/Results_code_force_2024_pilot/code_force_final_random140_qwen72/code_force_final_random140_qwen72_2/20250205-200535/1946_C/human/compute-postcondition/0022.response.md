The code snippet `r += rn` increments the value of `r` by the value of `rn`. Since `rn` is the result returned from the `dfs` function called with `node` and `y` as arguments, its value is specific to the outcome of that function call. However, without knowing the exact value of `rn`, we can only say that `r` is updated by adding `rn` to its current value.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned from the `dfs` function called with `node` and `y` as arguments, `r` is updated by adding `rn` to its current value.**
