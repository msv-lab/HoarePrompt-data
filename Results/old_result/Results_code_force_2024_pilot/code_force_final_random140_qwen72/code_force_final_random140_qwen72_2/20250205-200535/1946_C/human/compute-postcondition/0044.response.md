The tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the `stack`. The initial state specifies that `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and children, and `v` has at least one child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. Since the code only appends to the `stack`, no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `v` has at least one child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` in addition to its previous contents.**
