The value of `good_components[v]` is updated by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it. The variable `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`, which is a non-empty list. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`.**
