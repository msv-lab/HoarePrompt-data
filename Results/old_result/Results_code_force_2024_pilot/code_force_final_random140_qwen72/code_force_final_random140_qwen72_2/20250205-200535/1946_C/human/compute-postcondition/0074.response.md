Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after appending `(v, True)` and must contain at least one element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`.
- This operation modifies the `stack` by adding a new element to it.
- All other variables (`tree`, `s`, `x`, `v`, `postorder`, `good_components`, `remaining_size`) remain unchanged.
- The `stack` now contains at least one element, which is consistent with the initial state condition that it must contain at least one element.
