Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a distribution of bets such that the total amount bet is less than the return from any winning outcome. This means that for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should satisfy the condition that the sum of all bets \(\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j\) is strictly less than the return for the winning outcome \(k_i \times x_i\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \(m = k_1 \times k_2 \times \ldots \times k_n\).
   - It then calculates the bets \(c_i\) as \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\) for each outcome \(i\).
   - It finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the bets \(c_i\) using the `func_1` function.
   - It normalizes the bets by dividing each \(c_i\) by the GCD.
   - It checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than \(m\). If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \(m\) is calculated correctly as the product of all multipliers.
   - **Bet Calculation**: The bets \(c_i\) are calculated as \(\frac{m}{k_i}\), which ensures that the return for the winning outcome \(k_i \times c_i\) is \(m\).
   - **GCD Normalization**: The GCD of the bets is found and used to normalize the bets, ensuring that the bets are as small as possible while maintaining the required condition.
   - **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than \(m\). If it is, the bets are printed; otherwise, \(-1\) is printed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the sum of the bets is not less than \(m\) by printing \(-1\).
   - The program also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same, which would result in a GCD of the multipliers being the multipliers themselves, leading to a sum of bets equal to \(m\), which is correctly handled by printing \(-1\).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
