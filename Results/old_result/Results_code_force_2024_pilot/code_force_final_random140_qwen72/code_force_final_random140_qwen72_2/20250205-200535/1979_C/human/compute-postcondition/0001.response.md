The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If the list `numbers` has at least two elements, the loop can execute because `numbers[1:]` will contain at least one element. Before the loop starts, `hcf` is equal to the first element of the list `numbers`, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements, and `num` will be the second element of the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of the list, `hcf` is equal to the first element of the list `numbers`**
