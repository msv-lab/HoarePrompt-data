Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def distribute_coins(t, cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the number of outcomes `n` and a list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).**
