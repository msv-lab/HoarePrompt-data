t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second element is a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
