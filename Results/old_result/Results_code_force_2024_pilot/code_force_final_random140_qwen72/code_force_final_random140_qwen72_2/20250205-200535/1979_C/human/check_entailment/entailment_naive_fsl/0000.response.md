Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the calculation of the product `m`. It multiplies all elements of `k` together, which is not the correct approach to ensure that the sum of bets is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. Instead, the product of all `k` values should be divided by each individual `k[i]` to get the corresponding bet value. However, this approach can lead to very large numbers, which might not be necessary.

A more efficient and correct approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the `k` values and then divide by each `k[i]` to get the bets. This ensures that the sum of the bets is minimized and still satisfies the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```

Expected Output:
```
27 41 12
```

Actual Output:
```
-1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `-1` because the sum of the calculated bets is not less than the product `m`, leading to an incorrect conclusion that no valid distribution exists. The correct distribution, as shown in the example, should be `27 41 12`, where the total bet is 80, and the winnings for each outcome are 81, 82, and 84, respectively.
