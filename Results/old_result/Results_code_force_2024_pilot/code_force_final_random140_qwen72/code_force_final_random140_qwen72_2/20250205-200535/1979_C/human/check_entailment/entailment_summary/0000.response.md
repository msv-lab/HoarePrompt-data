Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of distributing bets across multiple outcomes in a game such that the total bet is less than the return from any winning outcome. Here's a breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, the number of outcomes `n`, and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k[i]`. This step is intended to find a common base for the bets, but it's overly complex and unnecessary. A simpler approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which would ensure that the bets are integers and proportional to the multipliers.

3. **Calculation of Bets `c`**: The bets `c[i]` are calculated as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that the bet on the i-th outcome is inversely proportional to its multiplier, which is a good start. However, the bets need to be scaled down to ensure they are minimal and still satisfy the condition.

4. **Finding the HCF (GCD)**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (HCF) of the list `c`. This is used to scale down the bets to their smallest possible values while maintaining the proportionality.

5. **Check and Output**: The program checks if the sum of the scaled-down bets is less than `m`. If it is, the bets are printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed. This check ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return from any winning outcome.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:

- **Flaw in `m` Calculation**: The calculation of `m` as the product of all multipliers `k[i]` is incorrect. This results in an unnecessarily large value for `m`, which can lead to incorrect scaling of the bets. Instead, the LCM of the multipliers should be used.

Given this flaw, the program may produce incorrect results in some cases. For example, if the multipliers are `[3, 3]`, the product `m` would be `9`, and the bets would be `[3, 3]`, which sums to `6`. This is not less than `9`, so the program would incorrectly print `-1` instead of a valid solution like `[1, 1]`.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** due to the flawed calculation of `m`.

Correctness: **False**
