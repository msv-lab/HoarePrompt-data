Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by 1 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`, `ans` is now `ans * (nums_left) % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans` to `ans * (nums_left) % MOD`.
- The values of `i`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` remain as they were after being decremented by 1.
- The value of `cur` remains unchanged unless `i == R[cur]`, in which case it would be incremented by 1. However, since the code snippet does not include the condition check, we assume `cur` remains unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is now `ans * (nums_left) % MOD`.
