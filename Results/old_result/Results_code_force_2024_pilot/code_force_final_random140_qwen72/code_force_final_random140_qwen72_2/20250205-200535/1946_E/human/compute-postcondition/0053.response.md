Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.** 

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to the result of `ans * nums_left % MOD`. All other variables (`i`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, and `nums_left`) remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still incremented by 1 as mentioned in the initial state.
