You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: the second value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the first element, and the first value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the second element.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second element is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b minus 1. Since a is divisible by b with no remainder, the quotient (a // b) is a whole number, and the expression -(a // b - 1) simplifies to -(quotient - 1).
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns the values `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `a` and `b` are integers with `b > 0`, `a >= b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`. The value `a % b` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `a // b` gives the integer division result.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple based on the following cases: (1) If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0)`. (2) If `a` is less than `b`, it returns a tuple with the elements swapped from the result of `func_1(b, a)`. (3) If `a` is exactly divisible by `b`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`. (4) If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and not divisible by `b`, it returns `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the tuple (1, 0)

Case_2: The program returns two values: the second value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the first element, and the first value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the second element.

Case_3: The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second element is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b minus 1. Since a is divisible by b with no remainder, the quotient (a // b) is a whole number, and the expression -(a // b - 1) simplifies to -(quotient - 1).

Case_4: The program returns the values `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `a` and `b` are integers with `b > 0`, `a >= b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`. The value `a % b` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `a // b` gives the integer division result.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
