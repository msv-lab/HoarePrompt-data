To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 1. Given the state right before the loop:

- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

The key variable in the loop condition is `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. Let's check the value of `i`:

- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

Given that `L` is a strictly increasing list and `L[0]` is 1, the last element `L[-1]` must be at least 2 (since `M1` is greater than 1). Therefore, `L[-1] - 1` must be at least 1.

However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. This means `L[-1]` must be at least 3. Since `L` is strictly increasing and `L[0]` is 1, `L[-1]` being at least 3 is a valid condition.

Thus, no adjustment is needed because the given state already ensures that `i` is greater than 1.

State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.**
