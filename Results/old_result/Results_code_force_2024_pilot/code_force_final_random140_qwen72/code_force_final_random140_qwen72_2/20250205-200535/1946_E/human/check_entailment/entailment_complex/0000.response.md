Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of possible permutations of length \( n \) given the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves calculating combinations and using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

### Key Points:
1. **Factorial Precomputation**: The program precomputes factorials up to \( 200,000 \) and stores them in the `facts` list. This is used to efficiently compute combinations later.
2. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with the length of the permutation \( n \), the number of prefix maximums \( m_1 \), and the number of suffix maximums \( m_2 \). It also reads the indices of these maximums.
3. **Validation**: The program checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations.
4. **Combination Calculation**: The program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations. It uses the `func_2` function to compute modular inverses and combinations.
5. **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are performed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

### Function Analysis:
- **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse. It is used to compute the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
- **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse and then multiplies it by `a` to get the final result.

### Correctness:
- **Precomputation**: The factorial precomputation is correct and necessary for efficient combination calculation.
- **Input Validation**: The validation checks are correct and ensure that the input is consistent with the problem constraints.
- **Combination Calculation**: The combination calculation using modular arithmetic is correct and follows the problem's requirements.
- **Modular Inverse**: The use of the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute the modular inverse is correct and ensures that the combination calculations are accurate.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
