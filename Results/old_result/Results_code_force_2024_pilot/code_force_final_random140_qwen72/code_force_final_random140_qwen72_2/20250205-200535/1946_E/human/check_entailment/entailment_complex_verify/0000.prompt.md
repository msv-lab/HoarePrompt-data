You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: the second value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the first element, and the first value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the second element.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second element is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b minus 1. Since a is divisible by b with no remainder, the quotient (a // b) is a whole number, and the expression -(a // b - 1) simplifies to -(quotient - 1).
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns the values `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `a` and `b` are integers with `b > 0`, `a >= b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`. The value `a % b` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `a // b` gives the integer division result.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative and returns a tuple of two integers. Depending on the relationship between `a` and `b`, the function behaves as follows: 

1. If `b` is 0, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0)`.
2. If `a` is less than `b`, the function returns a tuple with the elements swapped from the result of `func_1(b, a)`.
3. If `a` is exactly divisible by `b`, the function returns the tuple `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
4. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and not divisible by `b`, the function returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

In all cases, the function modifies the input values through recursive calls and arithmetic operations to produce the final tuple.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a list of integers, and the length of b is at least 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and `a` is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` (with a minimum length of 1). It computes and returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. The final state of the program includes the returned integer, which is the computed result.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, but the functions provided seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular inverses, which are not directly relevant to solving the permutation problem.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input: `n = 4`, `m1 = 2`, `m2 = 3`, `prefix_max = [1, 2]`, `suffix_max = [2, 3, 4]`.
- Expected Output: `3` (as explained in the problem description).
- Actual Output: The provided functions will not produce the correct output because they do not handle the permutation logic required by the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
