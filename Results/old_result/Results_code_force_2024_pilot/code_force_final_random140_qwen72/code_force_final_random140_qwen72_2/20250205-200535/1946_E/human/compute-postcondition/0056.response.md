Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by 1 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1.
- If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`.

All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
