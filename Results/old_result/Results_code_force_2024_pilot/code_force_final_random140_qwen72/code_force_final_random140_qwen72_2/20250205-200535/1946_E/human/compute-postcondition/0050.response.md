Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `ans`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `ans`, and `nums_left`) remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between these variables specified in the initial state continue to hold true.
