Output State: **The program returns `ans`, which is the final computed value based on the conditions described. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is the final computed value of the product of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.**
