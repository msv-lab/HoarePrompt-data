Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` (with a minimum length of 1). It computes and returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. The final state of the program includes the returned integer, which is the computed result. **
