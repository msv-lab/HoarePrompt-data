The variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `N` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `N`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, and `N` remains unchanged, the condition `i < N` should still hold true for the loop to execute again. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `ans`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged**
