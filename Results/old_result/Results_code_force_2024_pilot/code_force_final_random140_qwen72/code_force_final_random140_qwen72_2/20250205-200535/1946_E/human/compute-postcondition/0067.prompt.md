You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the final computed value based on the conditions described. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is the final computed value of the product of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints that `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. It also uses two lists, `L` and `R`, where `L` is a strictly increasing list of integers of length `M1` (1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N), and `R` is a strictly increasing list of integers of length `M2` (1 ≤ R[i] ≤ N). The function returns 0 in three specific cases (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3). In another case (Case_4), it returns `ans`, which is computed based on the values of `M1` and `M2`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and a sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is further modified by the product of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns 0.

Case_3: The program returns 0.

Case_4: The program returns `ans`, which is the final computed value based on the conditions described. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is the final computed value of the product of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
