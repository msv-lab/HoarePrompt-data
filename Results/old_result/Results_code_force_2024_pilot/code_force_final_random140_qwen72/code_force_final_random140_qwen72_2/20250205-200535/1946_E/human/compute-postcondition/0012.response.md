The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where both are integers and `b` is non-negative (`b >= 0`). The function returns different outputs based on the following conditions:

- **Case_1:** If `b` is 0, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0)`.
- **Case_2:** If `a` is less than `b`, the function returns a tuple where the first element is the second value returned by `func_1(b, a)`, and the second element is the first value returned by `func_1(b, a)`.
- **Case_3:** If `a` is exactly divisible by `b` (i.e., `a % b == 0`), the function returns a tuple `(1, -(a // b - 1))`, where the second element is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.
- **Case_4:** If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`, the function returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `a % b` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `a // b` gives the integer division result.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple based on the following cases: (1) If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0)`. (2) If `a` is less than `b`, it returns a tuple with the elements swapped from the result of `func_1(b, a)`. (3) If `a` is exactly divisible by `b`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`. (4) If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and not divisible by `b`, it returns `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
