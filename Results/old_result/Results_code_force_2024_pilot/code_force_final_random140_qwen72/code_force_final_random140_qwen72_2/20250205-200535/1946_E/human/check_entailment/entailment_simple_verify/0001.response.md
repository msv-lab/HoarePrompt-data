### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. It is also used to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo `a`.
     - If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`.
     - If `a < b`, it swaps `a` and `b` and calls itself recursively.
     - If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` and adjusts the results.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and then multiplies it by `a` and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic of the program is to count the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The program initializes a list `facts` to store factorials up to \( 200000 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - For each test case, it reads the input and checks if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial calculations involving factorials and modular inverses.
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, calculating the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements and updating the answer accordingly.

4. **Correctness of the Main Logic**:
   - The program correctly initializes the factorial list and uses it to compute combinations.
   - The conditions checked (e.g., `p[-1] != s[0]`, `p[0] != 1`, `s[-1] != n`) ensure that the given indices are consistent with the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The combinatorial calculations are performed correctly using modular arithmetic, ensuring that the result is modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are mathematically sound and appropriate for the problem's requirements.
   - The main logic correctly counts the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and ensures that the result is computed efficiently within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct in its implementation and meets the requirements of the problem. The main logic to count the permutations is present and correctly implemented.
