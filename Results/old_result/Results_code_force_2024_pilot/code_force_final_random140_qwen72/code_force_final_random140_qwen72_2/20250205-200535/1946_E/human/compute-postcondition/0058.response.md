Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD` if `i != R[cur]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The conditions for updating `ans` and the increments/decrements of `i`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged unless `i` equals `R[cur]`, in which case `cur` is incremented but `ans` is not updated. If `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`.
