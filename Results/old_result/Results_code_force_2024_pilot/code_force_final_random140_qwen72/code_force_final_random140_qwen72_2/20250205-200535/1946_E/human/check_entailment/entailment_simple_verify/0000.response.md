### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves combinatorial counting, specifically using factorials and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. However, it also returns the modular inverse of `a` modulo `b` when `b` is a prime number (in this case, \( 10^9 + 7 \)).
   - **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and then multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Main Logic Analysis:**
   - The main logic of the program involves:
     - Precomputing factorials up to \( 200002 \) and storing them in the `facts` list.
     - For each test case:
       - Reading the input values \( n \), \( m1 \), and \( m2 \).
       - Reading the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.
       - Checking if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, the number of permutations is 0.
       - Calculating the number of permutations using combinatorial counting:
         - For each suffix maximum, calculate the number of ways to place the remaining elements.
         - For each prefix maximum (excluding the last one), calculate the number of ways to place the remaining elements.
       - The final result is the product of all these counts, taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

4. **Evaluating the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly relevant to solving the permutation problem. However, this is incorrect.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed used to compute the modular inverse, which is necessary for the combinatorial calculations involving factorials.
   - The main logic correctly implements the combinatorial counting required to solve the problem.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is correctly structured to solve the problem as described.
   - The use of `func_1` and `func_2` is appropriate for the combinatorial calculations needed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
