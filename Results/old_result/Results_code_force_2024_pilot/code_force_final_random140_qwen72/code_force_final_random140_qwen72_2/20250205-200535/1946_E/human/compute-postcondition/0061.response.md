Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`. Regardless of the condition, `nums_left` is now `nums_left - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1.
- All other conditions and updates mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged, including the increment of `i`, the decrement of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and the potential updates to `cur` and `ans`.
- The final state reflects that `nums_left` is now one less than its previous value.
