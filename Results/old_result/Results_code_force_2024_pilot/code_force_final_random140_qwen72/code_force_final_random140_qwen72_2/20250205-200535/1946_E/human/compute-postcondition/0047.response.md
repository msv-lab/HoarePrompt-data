Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` remains a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` remains a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is now the product of the previous `ans` and `nums_left`, all taken modulo `MOD`. `cur` is `1`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is `R[0] + 1`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and `cur` is `1`. Additionally, `M2` is greater than 1. `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of its previous value and `nums_left`, all taken modulo `MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
