The code snippet `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` appends the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 (unchanged).
- `num` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer where the first element `L1[0]` must be at least 1 (unchanged).
- `res` is a list (initially empty or containing one element if `L1[0]` is divisible by `j`).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `j` is `j + 1` (unchanged).

The code appends the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to `res`. Since `i` is 0, the expression becomes `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)`. This value is appended to `res`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` must be greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer where the first element `L1[0]` must be at least 1, `res` contains the element `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`.**
