Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

# Program:
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prompts the user to enter the number of entries (`num`) and then asks for `num` integers, storing them in a list `L1`. For each integer in `L1`, the function finds the smallest divisor greater than or equal to 2, calculates the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for this divisor, and appends this result to a list `res`. Finally, it prints each element of `res` on a new line. The function modifies the state by creating and populating the lists `L1` and `res`, and printing the contents of `res`.
