Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer where the first element `L1[0]` must be at least 1, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 0, and `j` is the same as before the code execution, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
