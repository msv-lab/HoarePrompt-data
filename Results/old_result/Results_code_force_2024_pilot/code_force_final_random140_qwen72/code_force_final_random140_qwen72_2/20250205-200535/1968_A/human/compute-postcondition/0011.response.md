To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `j`, `L1`, and `i`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is used to index into the list `L1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be a valid index for `L1`. Given that `L1` contains `num` elements and `num` must be greater than 0, `i` should be 0 (the first index of the list).

2. **List `L1`**: The list `L1` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. This is already given by the state that `num` must be greater than 0 and `L1` is a list containing `num` elements.

3. **Variable `j`**: The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`. For the loop to execute, `L1[i]` must be at least 1 (since the range starts from 2). Therefore, `L1[0]` (the first element of the list) must be at least 1.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` must be 0.
- `L1` must have at least one element, and the first element (`L1[0]`) must be at least 1.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` must be greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer where the first element `L1[0]` must be at least 1, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
