Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer where the first element `L1[0]` must be at least 1, `res` is a list. If `L1[0]` is divisible by `j`, `res` contains one element which is the result of `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list and `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`.***
