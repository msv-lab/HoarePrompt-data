Postcondition: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` must be at least 2, and the current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`.**
