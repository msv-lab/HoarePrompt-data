The code snippet `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` appends a new element to the list `res`. This new element is calculated as the integer division of `L1[i]` by `j`, multiplied by `(j - 1)`. Given that `j` is 4, the expression simplifies to `L1[i] // 4 * 3`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **`res`**: A new element is appended to `res`. The new element is `L1[i] // 4 * 3`.
2. **Other Variables**: The values of `x`, `num`, `L1`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements with a new element `L1[i] // 4 * 3` appended, `i` is a valid index in `L1` (i.e., `i < num`), `L1[i]` must be at least 4, `j` is 4.**
