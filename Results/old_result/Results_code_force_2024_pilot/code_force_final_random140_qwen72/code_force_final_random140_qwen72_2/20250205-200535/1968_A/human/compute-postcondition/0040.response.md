The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has iterated through all elements of `L1`, meaning `i` is equal to `num - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `num` must still be greater than `i`.

However, since `i` has already iterated through all elements of `L1`, `i` should be `num` at the start of the next iteration, which means the loop condition `i < num` would no longer be true, and the loop would terminate.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the termination condition) is:
State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. For each element `L1[i]` in `L1`, `res` contains the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2. The index `i` is `num`.**
