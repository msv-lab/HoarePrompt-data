To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `j`: This is the loop variable that will take values from 2 to `L1[i]`.
   - `L1[i]`: This is the upper bound of the range for `j`.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(2, L1[i] + 1)` is non-empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, `L1[i]` must be at least 1 (since the range `range(2, 1 + 1)` would be `range(2, 2)`, which is empty).

3. **Given State:**
   - `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
   - `num` is greater than 0.
   - `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer.
   - `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements.
   - The index `i` is `num`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` is `num`, and `num` is greater than 0, `i` should be within the bounds of the list `L1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `L1[i]` must be at least 1.
   - The loop variable `j` should start at 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be a valid index in `L1`, which means `i` should be less than `num`.
- `L1[i]` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- `j` should start at 2.

### Final State:
State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements, `i` is a valid index in `L1` (i.e., `i < num`), `L1[i]` must be at least 1, `j` is 2**.
