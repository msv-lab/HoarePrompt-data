To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer.
- `res` is a list containing exactly `num` elements.
- Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`.

### Explanation:
1. **List `L1`**: This list contains `num` integers, each of which is an input integer.
2. **List `res`**: This list is constructed by iterating over each element in `L1` and performing the following operation:
   - For each element `L1[i]`, find the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` that is greater than or equal to 2.
   - Compute the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` and store it in `res[i]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*res, sep='\n')
```
This statement prints each element of the list `res` on a new line.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of integers, one per line, where each integer is the result of the computation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2.

Since the exact values of `L1` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `res`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given operations.

Output: **Each element of `res` on a new line, where each element is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, and `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`.**
