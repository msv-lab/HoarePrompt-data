Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 1000, `num` must be greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing one element which is an input integer, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code appends an integer input by the user to the list `L1`. The user is prompted to enter an integer, and this integer is added to `L1`. The other variables (`x`, `num`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
