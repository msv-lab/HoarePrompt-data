### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is a key factor in this problem.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( x \) to find the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \).
   - Once a divisor \( j \) is found, it calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) and appends it to the result list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \).
   - The calculation \( y = \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) is derived from the fact that \( y \) should be a multiple of \( \frac{x}{j} \) and less than \( x \).
   - This ensures that \( y \) is a valid candidate and maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the smallest divisor is 2, and \( y = 1 \), which is correct.
   - For larger values of \( x \), the program correctly finds a suitable \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the results in the correct format, one per line.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It finds a valid \( y \) for each \( x \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
