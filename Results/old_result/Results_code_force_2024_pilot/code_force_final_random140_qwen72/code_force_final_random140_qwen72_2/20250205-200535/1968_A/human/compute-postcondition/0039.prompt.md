Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. Each element in `res` is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `num`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
    if L1[i] % j == 0:
        res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` contains the first element `(L1[0] // j * (j - 1))`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged and the program continues. `i` is 0, and `L1[i]` must be at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` is at least 2, and `j` is 3. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then `res` contains one element which is `L1[0] // 3 * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` is at least 2, and `j` is 4. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then `res` contains one element which is `L1[0] // 3 * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
