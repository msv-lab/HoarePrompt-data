Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` is at least 2, and `j` is 4. If `L1[i] % j == 0`, then `res` contains one element which is `L1[0] // 3 * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
