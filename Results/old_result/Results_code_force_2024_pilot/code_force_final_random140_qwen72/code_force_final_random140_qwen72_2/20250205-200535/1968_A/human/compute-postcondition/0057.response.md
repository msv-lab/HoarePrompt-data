The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is mentioned that there is a constraint where `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. Since `x` is not passed as a parameter, it might be a global variable or defined within the function. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that an integer `x` exists such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided.**
