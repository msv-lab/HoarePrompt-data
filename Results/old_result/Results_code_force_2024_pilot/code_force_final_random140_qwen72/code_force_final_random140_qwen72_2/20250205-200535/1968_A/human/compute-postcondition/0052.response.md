Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements with a new element `L1[i] // 4 * 3` appended, `i` is a valid index in `L1` (i.e., `i < num`), `L1[i]` must be at least 4, `j` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
