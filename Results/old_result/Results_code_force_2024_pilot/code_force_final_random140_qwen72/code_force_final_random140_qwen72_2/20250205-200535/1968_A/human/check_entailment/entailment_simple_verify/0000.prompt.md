You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer representing the number of entries, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `num - 1`.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `x` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing exactly `num` elements. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`. The index `i` will have iterated through all valid indices in `L1` (i.e., from 0 to `num - 1`).
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: Each element of `res` on a new line, where each element is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, and `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the logic used to find `y` such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized is flawed. The program divides `x` by its smallest divisor greater than 1 and then multiplies the result by `(j - 1)`, which does not necessarily yield the correct `y`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `x = 10`. According to the problem description, we need to find `y` such that `gcd(10, y) + y` is maximized. The correct answer would be `y = 5` because `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6`, which is the maximum possible value.

However, the program will output `y = 4` because it divides `10` by its smallest divisor `2` and then calculates `10 // 2 * (2 - 1) = 5 * 1 = 5`, but it incorrectly outputs `4` due to the logic error.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this input, making it incorrect.
