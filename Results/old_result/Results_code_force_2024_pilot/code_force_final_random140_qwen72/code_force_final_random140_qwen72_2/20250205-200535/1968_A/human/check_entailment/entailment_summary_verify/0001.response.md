### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) plays a crucial role in determining the optimal \( y \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( x \) to find the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \).
   - Once a divisor \( j \) is found, it calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) and appends it to the result list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

3. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases and the integers \( x \).
   - It correctly finds the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \) greater than or equal to 2.
   - The calculation \( y = \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) is intended to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \) is indeed a valid choice because \( \gcd(x, j) = j \).
   - The formula \( y = \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) ensures that \( y \) is a multiple of \( \frac{x}{j} \) and less than \( x \).
   - However, the formula \( y = \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) might not always yield the maximum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
     - The smallest divisor \( j \) is 2.
     - \( y = \frac{10}{2} \times (2 - 1) = 5 \).
     - \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
     - However, if we choose \( y = 6 \), then \( \gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \), which is less than 10.
     - But if we choose \( y = 4 \), then \( \gcd(10, 4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 \), which is also less than 10.
     - Therefore, \( y = 5 \) is indeed the correct choice for \( x = 10 \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the smallest divisor is 2, and \( y = 1 \), which is correct.
   - For larger values of \( x \), the program correctly finds a suitable \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the results in the correct format, one per line.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It finds a valid \( y \) for each \( x \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
