Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `x` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`. The index `i` will have iterated through all valid indices in `L1` (i.e., from 0 to `num - 1`).**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, the variable `x` remains unchanged within its initial range. The variable `num` also remains unchanged, indicating the number of elements in the list `L1`. The list `L1` itself does not change and still contains the same `num` elements as it did initially. The list `res` now contains up to `num` elements, with each element being the result of the operation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2. The index `i` has been incremented through all valid indices in `L1`, from 0 to `num - 1`.
