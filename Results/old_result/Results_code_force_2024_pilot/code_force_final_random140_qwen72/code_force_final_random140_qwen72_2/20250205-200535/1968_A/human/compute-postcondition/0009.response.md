Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer representing the number of entries, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `num - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`num`**: This is the total number of iterations the loop will run, and it remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`L1`**: After the loop completes, `L1` will contain `num` elements, where each element is an integer input by the user during each iteration of the loop.
- **`res`**: Remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `num - 1`, because the loop runs from `0` to `num - 1`.
