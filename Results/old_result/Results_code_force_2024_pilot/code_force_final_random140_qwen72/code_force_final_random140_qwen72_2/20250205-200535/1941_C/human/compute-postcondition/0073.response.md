To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a string with a length greater than 5.
   - `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to index `i + 2` (inclusive).
   - If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.

2. **Determine the Value of `s`:**
   - We need to find the value of `s` based on the value of `i`.
   - The value of `i` depends on whether `s` is 'map' or 'pie'.

3. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3.
   - Otherwise, `i` is 1.

4. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   - Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `i`, we need to consider both cases:
     - Case 1: `i` is 1 (default case).
     - Case 2: `i` is 3 (if `s` is 'map' or 'pie').

5. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `i` is 1**
     - `s` is the substring of `a` from index 1 to index 3.
     - If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` becomes 3 and `ans` becomes 1.
     - If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `i` remains 1 and `ans` remains 0.
   - **Case 2: `i` is 3**
     - `s` is the substring of `a` from index 3 to index 5.
     - If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` remains 3 and `ans` remains 1.
     - If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `i` becomes 1 and `ans` becomes 0.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `i`, we need to consider the most likely scenario based on the conditions.
   - If `i` is initially 1, and `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `i` remains 1 and `s` is the substring from index 1 to index 3.
   - If `i` is initially 3, and `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` remains 3 and `s` is the substring from index 3 to index 5.

Given the conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **s (where s is the substring of a from index i to index i + 2, and i is either 1 or 3 depending on whether s is 'map' or 'pie')**
