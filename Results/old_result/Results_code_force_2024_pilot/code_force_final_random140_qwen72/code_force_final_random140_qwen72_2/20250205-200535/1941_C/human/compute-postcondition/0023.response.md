The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `i` was either 2 or 6 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie'. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 5 or 9 respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `a` is a string containing the user's input and `len(a)` must be greater than 8, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 9, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 5.**
