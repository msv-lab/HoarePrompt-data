The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple inputs, possibly in the form of a list of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a string `s`.

Each test case involves:
- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the length of the string `s`.
- A string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to process each test case and produce some output based on the input parameters. Since the specific output is not detailed in the problem statement, we can infer that the function processes the string `s` in some way, but the exact nature of the processing and the output are not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
