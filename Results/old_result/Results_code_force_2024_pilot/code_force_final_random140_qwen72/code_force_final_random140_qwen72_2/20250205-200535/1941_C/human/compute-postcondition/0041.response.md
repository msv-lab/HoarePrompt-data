Postcondition: **`_` remains a placeholder, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is the user's input string with a length greater than 2, `s` is the first valid substring of length 3 from `a` starting at index 0. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**
