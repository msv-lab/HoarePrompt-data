Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the program attempts to skip over the substrings "map" and "pie". When it finds such a substring, it increments `i` by 3 and increases `ans` by 1. This approach only accounts for one instance of the substring at a time and does not consider overlapping occurrences or the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the string `"mappppie"`. The program will find the substring "map" and increment `i` by 3, but it will not correctly handle the subsequent "pppie" part, which also needs to be checked for the substring "pie".

A correct approach would involve identifying all overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" and calculating the minimum number of deletions required to remove these substrings. This can be done using dynamic programming or a more sophisticated sliding window technique to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_deletions_to_beautiful(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
        if i >= 3:
            if s[i-3:i] == "map":
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-3])
            if s[i-3:i] == "pie":
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-3])
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-1])
    
    return dp[n]

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(min_deletions_to_beautiful(s))
```

This version uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum deletions required up to each position in the string, ensuring that all overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" are handled correctly.
