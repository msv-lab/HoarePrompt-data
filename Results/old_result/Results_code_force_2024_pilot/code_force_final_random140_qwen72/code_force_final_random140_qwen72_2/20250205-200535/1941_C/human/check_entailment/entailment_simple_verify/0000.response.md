Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic of incrementing `ans` by 1 and `i` by 3 whenever it finds a substring "map" or "pie" is flawed. This approach fails to account for overlapping occurrences of the substrings and does not ensure the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For instance, in the string "mappie", the program will only detect "map" and skip the next two characters, leaving "pie" intact, which is incorrect. A more sophisticated approach is needed to handle overlapping substrings and ensure the minimum deletions.

Final: **False**
