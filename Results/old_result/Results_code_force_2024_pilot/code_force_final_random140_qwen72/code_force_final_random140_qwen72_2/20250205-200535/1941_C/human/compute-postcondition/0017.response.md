The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was either 1 (if the new `s` is 'map' or 'pie') or 0 (otherwise). Therefore, the new value of `ans` is either 2 or 1, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string containing the user's input and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (inclusive), `ans` is 2 if the new `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 6 if the new `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4.**
