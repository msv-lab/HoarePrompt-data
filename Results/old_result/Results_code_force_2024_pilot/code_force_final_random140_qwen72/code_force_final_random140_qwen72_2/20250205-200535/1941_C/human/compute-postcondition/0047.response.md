The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` remains a placeholder, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is the user's input string with a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and of length 3, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3, or `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5.**
