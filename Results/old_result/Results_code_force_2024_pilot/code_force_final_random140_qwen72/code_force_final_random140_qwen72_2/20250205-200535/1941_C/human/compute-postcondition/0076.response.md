The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was either 3 or 1, depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie'. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 4 if `s` was 'map' or 'pie', and 2 if `s` was not 'map' or 'pie'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` has a length greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i-1` to index `i + 1` (inclusive), if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4; otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
