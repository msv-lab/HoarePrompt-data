To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < len(a) - 2`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`.
- We need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(a) - 2` after the adjustments.

### Given State:
- `_` remains a placeholder (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `int(input())` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `a` is the user's input string with a length greater than 2.
- `s` is the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and of length 3.
- If `s` is 'map' or 's` is 'pie', then:
  - `i` is 4 if it was initially 1, or `i` is 6 if it was initially 3.
  - `ans` is 1 if `i` was initially 1, or `ans` is 2 if `i` was initially 3.
- Otherwise:
  - `i` is 2 if it was initially 1, or `i` remains 3 if it was initially 3.
  - `ans` is 0 if `i` was initially 1, or `ans` is 1 if `i` was initially 3.
- `len(a)` must be greater than 3 if `i` was initially 1, or `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` was initially 3.

### Adjustments:
- The key variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `i` was initially 1:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` could be 4 or 2.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 3.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time:
     - If `i` is 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 6.
     - If `i` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 4.

2. **If `i` was initially 3:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` could be 6 or 3.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 5.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time:
     - If `i` is 6, `len(a)` must be greater than 8.
     - If `i` is 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 5.

### Final State:
- If `i` was initially 1 and is now 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 6.
- If `i` was initially 1 and is now 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 4.
- If `i` was initially 3 and is now 6, `len(a)` must be greater than 8.
- If `i` was initially 3 and is now 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 5.

State: **`_` remains a placeholder, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is the user's input string with a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and of length 3. If `s` is 'map' or 's` is 'pie', then `i` is 4 if it was initially 1, or `i` is 6 if it was initially 3, and `ans` is 1 if `i` was initially 1, or `ans` is 2 if `i` was initially 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2 if it was initially 1, or `i` remains 3 if it was initially 3, and `ans` is 0 if `i` was initially 1, or `ans` is 1 if `i` was initially 3. Additionally, `len(a)` must be greater than 6 if `i` is 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 4 if `i` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 6, or `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3.**
