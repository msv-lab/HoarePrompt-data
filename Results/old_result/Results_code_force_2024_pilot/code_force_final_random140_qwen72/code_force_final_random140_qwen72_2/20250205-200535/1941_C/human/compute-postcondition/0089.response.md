Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string `a` of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie" in the string `a` and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state includes the printed counts for each test case. **
