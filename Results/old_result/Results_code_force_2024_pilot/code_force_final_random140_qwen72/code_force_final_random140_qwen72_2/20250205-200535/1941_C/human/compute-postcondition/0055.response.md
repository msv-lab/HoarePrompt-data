Postcondition: **`_` remains a placeholder, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is the user's input string with a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and of length 3. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 7 if it was initially 1, or `i` is 9 if it was initially 3, and `ans` is 2 if `i` was initially 1, or `ans` is 3 if `i` was initially 3. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 5 if it was initially 1, or `i` is 7 if it was initially 3, and `ans` is 1 if `i` was initially 1, or `ans` is 2 if `i` was initially 3. If `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `i` is 3 if it was initially 1, or `i` is 4 if it was initially 3, and `ans` is 0 if `i` was initially 1, or `ans` is 1 if `i` was initially 3. Additionally, `len(a)` must be greater than 6 if `i` is 7, `len(a)` must be greater than 4 if `i` is 5, `len(a)` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 9, `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 6, `len(a)` must be greater than 6 if `i` is 5, `len(a)` must be greater than 4 if `i` is 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 7, or `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 4.**
