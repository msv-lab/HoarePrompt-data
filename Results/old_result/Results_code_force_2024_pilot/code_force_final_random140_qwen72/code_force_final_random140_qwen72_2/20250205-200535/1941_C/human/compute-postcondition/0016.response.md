The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is 3 if the new `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and otherwise `i` is 1, after incrementing `i` by 3, the new value of `i` will be 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 4 otherwise.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string containing the user's input and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (inclusive), `ans` is 1 if the new `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 6 if the new `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4.**
