To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(a) - 2:
```

The loop will execute if the condition `i < len(a) - 2` is true. Let's break down the variables involved:

- `i` is 0.
- `len(a)` is the length of the user's input string `a`.

For the loop to execute, the following must be true:
- `i < len(a) - 2`
- Substituting `i` with 0, we get: `0 < len(a) - 2`
- Simplifying, we get: `len(a) > 2`

This means that the length of the string `a` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `a` is the user's input string.
- `i` is 0.
- `ans` is 0.
- `s` will be the first valid substring of length 3 processed by the loop.

The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `a` to ensure that `len(a) > 2`.

State: **`_` remains a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `a` is the user's input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `s` will be the first valid substring of length 3 processed by the loop.**
