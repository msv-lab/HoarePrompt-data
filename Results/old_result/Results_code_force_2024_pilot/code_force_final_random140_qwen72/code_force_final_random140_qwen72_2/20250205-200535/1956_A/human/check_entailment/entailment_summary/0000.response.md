### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a game where players are removed based on a sequence `a` of positions. The game continues until no more players can be removed according to the sequence `a`.
   - The goal is to determine how many players remain (winners) for different initial numbers of players `n`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(p)`**:
     - This function precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial player counts from 1 to 100.
     - It iterates over each possible initial player count `n` and simulates the removal process using the sequence `p`.
     - The `bisect_right` function is used to find how many elements in `p` are less than or equal to the current number of players `cur_n`.
     - The number of players removed in each round is subtracted from `cur_n` until no more players can be removed.
     - The final number of remaining players for each `n` is stored in the `remaining_players` list.
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - For each test case, it reads the sequence `p` and a list of query indices `qs`.
     - It calls `func_1(p)` to get the precomputed `remaining_players` list.
     - It then selects the results for the given query indices and formats them as a single string.
     - The results for all test cases are collected and returned as a list of strings.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **`func_1(p)`** correctly simulates the game for all possible initial player counts from 1 to 100.
   - **`func_2()`** correctly processes multiple test cases, reads the input, calls `func_1(p)`, and formats the results as required.
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct as it meets the problem requirements and produces the expected output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
