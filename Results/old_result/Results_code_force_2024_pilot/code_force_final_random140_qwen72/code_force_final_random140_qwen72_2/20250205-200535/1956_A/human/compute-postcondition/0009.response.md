The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**
