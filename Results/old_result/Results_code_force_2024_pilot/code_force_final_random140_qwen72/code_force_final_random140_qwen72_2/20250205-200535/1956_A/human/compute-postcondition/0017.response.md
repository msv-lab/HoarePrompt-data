Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by the original `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `k` and `q`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, `res`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The values of `k` and `q` are now the integers provided by the user.
