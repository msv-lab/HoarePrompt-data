Output State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3, the second element is 0, the third element is 0, and the fourth element is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the initial value of `cur_n`.** 

Explanation: The code `remaining_players[n] = cur_n` updates the `n`-th element of the `remaining_players` list to the value of `cur_n`. Given that `n` is 3 and `cur_n` is 0, the fourth element of `remaining_players` (index 3) is set to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
