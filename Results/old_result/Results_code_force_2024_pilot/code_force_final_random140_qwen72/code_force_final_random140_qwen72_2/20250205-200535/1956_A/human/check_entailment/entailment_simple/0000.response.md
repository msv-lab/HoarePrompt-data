Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `p` of integers in strictly increasing order and computes the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.
   - It initializes a list `remaining_players` of size 101 (to accommodate indices from 1 to 100) with zeros.
   - For each `n` from 1 to 100, it simulates the process of removing players according to the positions specified in `p`.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as the current number of players `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` is used to find the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`. This count is subtracted from `cur_n` to simulate the removal of players.
   - After the loop, the remaining number of players `cur_n` is stored in `remaining_players[n]`.
   - The function returns the `remaining_players` list, which correctly contains the number of remaining players for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1(p)` to get the `remaining_players` list.
   - It then constructs the result for the current test case by looking up the number of remaining players for each initial player count in `qs` using the `remaining_players` list.
   - The results for all test cases are collected in a list `results` and returned.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program correctly processes the input and produces the expected output for each test case.
   - The logic for simulating the game and determining the number of remaining players is implemented correctly.
   - The use of `bisect.bisect_right` ensures efficient computation of the number of players to remove in each round.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
