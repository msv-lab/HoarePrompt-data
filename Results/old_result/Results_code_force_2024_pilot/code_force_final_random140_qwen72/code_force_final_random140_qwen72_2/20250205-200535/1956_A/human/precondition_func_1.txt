t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 250. k and q are positive integers representing the length of the sequence `a` and the number of values `n_i` to solve for, respectively, where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100. p is a list of k integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 ≤ p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] ≤ 100. qs is a list of q integers, where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < q.
