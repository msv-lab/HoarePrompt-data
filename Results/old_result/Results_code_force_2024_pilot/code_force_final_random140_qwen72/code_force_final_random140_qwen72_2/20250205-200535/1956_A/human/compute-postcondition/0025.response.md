Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints provided by external inputs `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, each a string formed by concatenating the string representations of elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, separated by spaces. `remaining_players` is derived from the list `p` through a process defined by `func_1`.**
