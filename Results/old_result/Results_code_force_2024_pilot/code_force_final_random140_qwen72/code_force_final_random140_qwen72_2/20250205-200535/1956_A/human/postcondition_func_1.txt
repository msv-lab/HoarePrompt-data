The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of input data, processes each set, and returns a list of results. Each set of input data includes the length of a sequence `p`, a list of integers `p`, and a list of query indices `qs`. For each set, the function computes a new list `remaining_players` by calling `func_1(p)`, then selects elements from `remaining_players` based on the indices in `qs`. These selected elements are converted to strings and concatenated into a single string, which is added to the final list `results`. After processing all sets, the function returns `results`, a list of `t` strings, where each string represents the concatenated results of the corresponding set of queries.
