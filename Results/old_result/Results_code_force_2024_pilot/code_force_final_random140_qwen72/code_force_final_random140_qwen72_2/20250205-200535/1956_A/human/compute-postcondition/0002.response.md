The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0 (indicating the start of the loop)**
