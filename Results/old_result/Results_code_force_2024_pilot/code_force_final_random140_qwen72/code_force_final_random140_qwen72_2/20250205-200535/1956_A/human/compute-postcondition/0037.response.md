Output State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`.**

Explanation: The `bisect.bisect_right` function finds the insertion point for `cur_n` in the sorted list `p` to maintain the order. This insertion point is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`. The value of `count` is updated to this index. All other variables remain unchanged.
