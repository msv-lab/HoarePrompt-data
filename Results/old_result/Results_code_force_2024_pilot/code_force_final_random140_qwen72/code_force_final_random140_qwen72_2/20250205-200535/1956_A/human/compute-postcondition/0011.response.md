Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `p`.
- The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p`.
- Since the input is provided by the user, the specific values of `p` depend on the user's input, but it is now a list of integers.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, `res`, `results`) remain as they were in the initial state.
