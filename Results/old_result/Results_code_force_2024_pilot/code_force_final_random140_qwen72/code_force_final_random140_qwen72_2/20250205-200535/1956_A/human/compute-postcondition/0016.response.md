The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 2, and `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by the original `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**
