Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly initializes `remaining_players` to store the number of remaining players for each initial player count from 1 to 100.
   - It iterates over each possible initial player count `n`.
   - For each `n`, it simulates the rounds of the game by repeatedly removing players at positions specified in the list `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The use of `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` ensures that the correct number of players to be removed is determined efficiently.
   - The result of this simulation is stored in the `remaining_players` list, which is then returned.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It uses the precomputed `remaining_players` list from `func_1` to quickly determine the number of remaining players for each initial player count in `qs`.
   - The results are collected and returned as a list of strings, each representing the results for a test case.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the number of players is less than the smallest value in `p` (no players are removed).
   - It correctly handles the case where the number of players is greater than the largest value in `p` (players are removed until no more can be removed).
   - It correctly handles the case where the number of players is exactly equal to one of the values in `p` (the exact player is removed).

4. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the logic and flow of the program are as intended.
   - The precomputation in `func_1` ensures that the main function `func_2` can quickly look up the results for each test case, making the solution efficient.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the game logic and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
