Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **If `n < m`**: This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is less than the desired number of cubes `m`. If true, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes in the tower, so the program prints 'NO'.
   - **Else if `n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0`**: This condition checks if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. This is because:
     - If `n` and `m` are both odd, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
     - If `n` and `m` are both even, it is also possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
     - If one is odd and the other is even, it is not possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked.

The logic and conditions used in the program align perfectly with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
