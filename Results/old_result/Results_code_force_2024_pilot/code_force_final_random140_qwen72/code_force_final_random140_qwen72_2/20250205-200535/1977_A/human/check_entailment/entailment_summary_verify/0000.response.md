### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Condition**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**: Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
3. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Key Observations:
- **Number of Moves (`n`)**: The total number of moves.
- **Desired Number of Cubes (`m`)**: The number of cubes we want to end up with.
- **Parity**: The parity (odd or even) of `n` and `m` plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility.

#### Parity Analysis:
- **If `n` is odd**:
  - The final number of cubes `m` must also be odd to be achievable. This is because starting from 0 (even), adding or removing 1 cube an odd number of times will result in an odd number of cubes.
- **If `n` is even**:
  - The final number of cubes `m` must also be even to be achievable. Starting from 0 (even), adding or removing 1 cube an even number of times will result in an even number of cubes.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program first checks if `n < m`. If true, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - This check is correct and necessary.

2. **Parity Check**:
   - The program then checks the parity of `n` and `m`.
   - It prints 'YES' if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.
   - This check is based on the parity analysis mentioned above and is correct.

#### Function Summary Verification:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
- It prints 'NO' if `n < m`.
- It prints 'YES' if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.
- This matches the problem requirements and the parity analysis.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description. The initial check ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes, and the parity check ensures that the final number of cubes is achievable based on the number of moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
