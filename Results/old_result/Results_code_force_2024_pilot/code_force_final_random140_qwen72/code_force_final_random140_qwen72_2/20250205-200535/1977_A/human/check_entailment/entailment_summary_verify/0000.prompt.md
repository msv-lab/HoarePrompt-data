You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input. If `n` is less than `m`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further test cases are left to process.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `n` (number of moves) is less than `m` (desired number of cubes). If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so it prints 'NO'. This is correct because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves you have.

2. **Parity Check**: The program then checks the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m`. It prints 'YES' if both `n` and `m` are either odd or even. This is based on the observation that:
   - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes `m` must also be odd to be achievable.
   - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes `m` must also be even to be achievable.

This logic covers all possible scenarios:
- If `n` is odd and `m` is odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.
- If `n` is even and `m` is even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.
- If `n` is odd and `m` is even, or if `n` is even and `m` is odd, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes.

Given these conditions, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
