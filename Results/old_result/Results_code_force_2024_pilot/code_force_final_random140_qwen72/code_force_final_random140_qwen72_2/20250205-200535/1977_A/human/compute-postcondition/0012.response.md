Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are updated to new values provided by the input.
- The conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `m` (whether `n` < `m`, `n` ≥ `m`, both being odd or even) will depend on the new values of `n` and `m`.
- The range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This code simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same output regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or the input range.

Output: **YES**
