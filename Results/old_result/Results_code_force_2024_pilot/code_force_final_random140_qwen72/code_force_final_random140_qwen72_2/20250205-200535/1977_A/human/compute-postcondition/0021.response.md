Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have executed, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, the values of `n` and `m` were read from the input, and the loop printed 'NO' if `n` was less than `m`, or 'YES' if `n` and `m` were both odd or both even. The loop has completed all its iterations, and no further test cases are left to process.**
