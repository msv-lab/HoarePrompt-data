Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n < m:
        print('NO')
    elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input. If `n` < `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`. If `n` ≥ `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`. Additionally, if both `n` and `m` are odd, or both `n` and `m` are even, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input. If `n` < `m`, the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `m` (whether `n` < `m`, `n` ≥ `m`, both being odd or even) will depend on the new values of `n` and `m`. If `n` ≥ `m`, and `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `m` (whether `n` < `m`, `n` ≥ `m`) will depend on the new values of `n` and `m`. The range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input, the range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left. If `n` < `m`, the program continues normally. If `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the program continues to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
