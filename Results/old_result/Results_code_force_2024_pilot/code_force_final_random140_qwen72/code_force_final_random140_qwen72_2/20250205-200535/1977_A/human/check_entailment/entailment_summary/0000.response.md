Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the logic required to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key points are:

1. **Base Condition**: If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.
2. **Parity Check**: The program checks if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. This is because:
   - If `n` is even, the number of cubes added and removed must balance out to an even number of total changes, which means the final number of cubes (`m`) must also be even.
   - If `n` is odd, the number of cubes added and removed results in an odd number of total changes, which means the final number of cubes (`m`) must also be odd.

The program correctly implements these conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to handle all edge cases and logical conditions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
