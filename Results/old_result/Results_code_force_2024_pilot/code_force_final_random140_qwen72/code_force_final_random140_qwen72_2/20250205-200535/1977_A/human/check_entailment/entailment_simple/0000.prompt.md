Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have executed, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, the values of `n` and `m` were read from the input, and the loop printed 'NO' if `n` was less than `m`, or 'YES' if `n` and `m` were both odd or both even. The loop has completed all its iterations, and no further test cases are left to process.
