Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input. If `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `m` (whether `n` < `m`, `n` ≥ `m`) will depend on the new values of `n` and `m`. The range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.***
