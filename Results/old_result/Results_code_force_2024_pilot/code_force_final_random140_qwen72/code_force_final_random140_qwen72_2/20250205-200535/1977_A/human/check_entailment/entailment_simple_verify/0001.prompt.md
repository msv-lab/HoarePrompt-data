You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have executed, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, the values of `n` and `m` were read from the input, and the loop printed 'NO' if `n` was less than `m`, or 'YES' if `n` and `m` were both odd or both even. The loop has completed all its iterations, and no further test cases are left to process.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

3. **First Condition (`n < m`)**:
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves you have. Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

4. **Second Condition (`n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0)`)**:
   - This condition checks if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.
   - **Odd Case**: If `n` is odd and `m` is odd, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because an odd number of moves can result in an odd number of cubes.
   - **Even Case**: If `n` is even and `m` is even, it is also possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes.
   - **Mixed Case**: If `n` is odd and `m` is even, or vice versa, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because an odd number of moves cannot result in an even number of cubes, and an even number of moves cannot result in an odd number of cubes.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It ensures that the number of moves and the desired number of cubes are consistent with the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
