Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `n` (number of moves) is less than `m` (desired number of cubes). If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, so it prints 'NO'. This is correct because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves you have.

2. **Parity Check**: The program then checks the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m`. It prints 'YES' if both `n` and `m` are either odd or even. This is based on the observation that:
   - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes `m` must also be odd to be achievable.
   - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes `m` must also be even to be achievable.

This logic covers all possible scenarios:
- If `n` is odd and `m` is odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.
- If `n` is even and `m` is even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.
- If `n` is odd and `m` is even, or if `n` is even and `m` is odd, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes.

Given these conditions, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
