Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input, the range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, and this remains unchanged.
- The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `m` to the new values provided by the input.
- The condition that the range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left is still valid, as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- The values of `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user input, replacing their previous values.
