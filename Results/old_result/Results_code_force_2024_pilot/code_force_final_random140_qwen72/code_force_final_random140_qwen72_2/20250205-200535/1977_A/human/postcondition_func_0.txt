The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input. If `n` is less than `m`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further test cases are left to process.
