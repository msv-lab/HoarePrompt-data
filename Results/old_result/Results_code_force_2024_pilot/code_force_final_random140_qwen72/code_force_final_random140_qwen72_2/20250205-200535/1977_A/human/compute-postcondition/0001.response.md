The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `n` and `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and greater than 0

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input provided. Since the input is split and converted to integers, `n` and `m` will each be an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.**
