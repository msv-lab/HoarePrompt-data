Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input. If `n` < `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`. If `n` ≥ `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`. Additionally, if both `n` and `m` are odd, or both `n` and `m` are even, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.***
