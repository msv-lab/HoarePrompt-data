The function `func` accepts several parameters: `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `d`, and `f`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with each test case having its own set of parameters. For each test case:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 × 10^5`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 × 10^9` and `a_i < a_{i+1}` (i.e., the list is sorted in ascending order).
- `d` is a list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9`.
- `f` is a list of `k` integers where `1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9`.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the input values. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `d`, and `f`. It processes these parameters for `t` test cases, where each test case involves integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a`, `d`, and `f` with specific constraints. The function returns a result based on the input values for each test case.**
