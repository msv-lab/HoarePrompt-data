The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The input is expected to be a positive integer.

Given the code:
```python
n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
```

The impact of this code is:
- It reads a line of input, which is expected to contain three space-separated positive integers.
- These integers are converted to integer type and assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k`.

The variables `_` and `t` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, and `k` is the third integer from the input.**
