You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

    #State: After the loop completes all iterations, `_` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values from the last iteration's input. The lists `a`, `b`, and `f` will contain the values from the last iteration's input, with `b` and `f` being sorted. The list `gap` will contain tuples representing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple. The variables `start` and `end` will be the second and third elements of the first tuple in `gap`, respectively. The variable `mid` will be `(start + end) // 2`. The variable `nd` will be 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise it will be the first element of the second tuple in `gap`. The variable `i` will be `m - 1`, indicating the last index of the list `b`. The variable `j` will be the last computed index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[m-1]`. The variable `s` will be the last computed value of `f[j - 1] + b[m-1]` or `f[j] + b[m-1]` depending on the conditions. The variable `res` will be the minimum value found during the loop execution of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` values within the range `start < s < end`. If `res` was initially `inf`, it will remain `inf` if no valid `s` was found; otherwise, it will be updated to the minimum valid value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of inputs, each set representing a test case. For each test case, it takes integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a`, `b`, and `f` as inputs. It then calculates the optimal position to place a new element in the list `a` such that the maximum gap between any two adjacent elements is minimized. This is done by considering the gaps between consecutive elements in `a`, sorting these gaps, and then using binary search to find the best position for the new element. The function prints the minimum possible maximum gap for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for minimizing the imbalance in the set of problem complexities by potentially adding one new problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program seems to be correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, including the number of problems, models, and functions, as well as their respective complexities.

2. **Gap Calculation**: It calculates the gaps between consecutive complexities in the original set of problems and sorts these gaps in descending order to focus on the largest gap first.

3. **Binary Search for Optimal Insertion**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the best possible complexity to insert within the largest gap. It considers both the exact match and the closest lower value to ensure the optimal insertion point.

4. **Result Calculation**: It calculates the new imbalance after inserting the new problem and updates the result if a smaller imbalance is found.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases, such as when there is only one gap or when no suitable insertion point is found, by printing the original largest gap.

Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of various scenarios, the program appears to meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
