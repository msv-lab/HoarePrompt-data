The code snippet `f = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts separated by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `f`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `b` is a list of integers from the input

After executing the code:
- `f` is now a list of integers read from the input.

The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is a list of integers from the input.**
