The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's ability to execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state, the value of `t` is already defined as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, the input function call is necessary to determine the actual number of iterations. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input is expected to be a positive integer, and the loop counter `_` is initialized appropriately.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input is expected to be a positive integer**
