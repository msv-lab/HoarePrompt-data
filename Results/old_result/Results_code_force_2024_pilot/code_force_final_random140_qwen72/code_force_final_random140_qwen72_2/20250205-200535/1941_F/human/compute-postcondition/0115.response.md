Postcondition: ***`res` is the value determined by the conditions described in the task. If `j >= 1` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the maximum of `(end - s)`, `(s - start)`, and `nd`. `i` is `x + 1`, `m` is greater than `x + 1`, `remain` is `mid - b[x + 1]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `j >= 1` but `s` is not within the range `start < s < end`, or if `j < 1`, none of the variables are modified. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.***
