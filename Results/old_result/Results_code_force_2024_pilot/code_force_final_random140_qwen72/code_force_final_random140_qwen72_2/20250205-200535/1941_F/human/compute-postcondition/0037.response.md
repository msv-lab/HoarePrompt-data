Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 1, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `remain` would fit to maintain the sorted order of `f`. `s` and `res` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` updates the value of `j` to the index in the sorted list `f` where `remain` would fit to maintain the sorted order of `f`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `s`, `res`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
