Postcondition: **`res` is set to infinity (`inf`), `_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers from the new input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input sorted in ascending order, `f` is a new list of integers from the new input sorted in ascending order, `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, where each tuple is `(y - x, x, y)` for consecutive elements `y` and `x` in `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 0, `remain` is `(start + end) // 2 - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, and `j` is equal to `k`, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[0]`, and the value of `s` is such that `start < s < end`.**
