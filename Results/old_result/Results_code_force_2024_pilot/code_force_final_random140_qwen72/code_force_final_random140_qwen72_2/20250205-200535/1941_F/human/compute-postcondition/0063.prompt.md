Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `res` is `inf`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `remain` would fit to maintain the sorted order of `f`. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, then `res` is the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains `inf`. If `j ≠ k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j ≥ 1`, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is the minimum of the previous `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 0, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers greater than 0, k are integers from the input, a is a list of integers from the input, b is a sorted list of integers from the input, f is a sorted list of integers from the input, gap is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, start is the second element of the first tuple in gap, end is the third element of the first tuple in gap, mid is (start + end) // 2, nd is 0 if the length of gap is 1, otherwise nd is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is 1, remain is mid - b[1], j is the index in f where remain would fit to maintain the sorted order of f. If j == k, s is f[j - 1] + b[1]. If start < s < end, res is the minimum of the previous res and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, res remains unchanged. If j is greater than or equal to 1, s is f[j - 1] + b[i]. If start < s < end, res is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, res remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 0, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers greater than 0, k are integers from the input, a is a list of integers from the input, b is a sorted list of integers from the input, f is a sorted list of integers from the input, gap is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, start is the second element of the first tuple in gap, end is the third element of the first tuple in gap, mid is (start + end) // 2, nd is 0 if the length of gap is 1, otherwise nd is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is 2, remain is mid - b[2], j is the index in f where remain would fit to maintain the sorted order of f. If j == k, s is f[j - 1] + b[2]; otherwise, s is f[j] + b[2] if j < 1, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[2]. If start < s < end, res is updated to the minimum of the previous res and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, res remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
