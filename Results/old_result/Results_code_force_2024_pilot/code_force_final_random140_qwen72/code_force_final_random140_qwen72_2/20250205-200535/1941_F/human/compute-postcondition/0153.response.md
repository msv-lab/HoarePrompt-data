Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers, `res` is set to `inf`, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[0]`, `s` remains unchanged, `_`, `t`, `gap`, `start` is set to the second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `end` is set to the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is set to `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list, `remain` is set to `mid - b[0]`.**
