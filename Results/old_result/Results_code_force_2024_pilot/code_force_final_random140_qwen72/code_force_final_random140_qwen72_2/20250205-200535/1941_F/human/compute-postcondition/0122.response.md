Postcondition: ***`j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[x + 2]`, `res` is the value determined by the conditions described in the task. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. `i` is `x + 2`, `m` is greater than `x + 2`, `remain` is `mid - b[x + 2]`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[x + 2]`. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.***
