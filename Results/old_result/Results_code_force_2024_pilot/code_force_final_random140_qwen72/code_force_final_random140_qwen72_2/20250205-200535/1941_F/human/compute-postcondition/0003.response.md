Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `a = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` now holds a list of integers derived from the input.
