Postcondition: ***`j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[x + 2]`, `i` is `x + 2`, `m` is greater than `x + 2`, `remain` is `mid - b[x + 2]`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is the minimum of the previous `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.***
