Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `b` is a list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers. `res` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, `remain` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `_`, `t`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `res`, `i`, `j`, `remain`, `s`, `_`, `t`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.
