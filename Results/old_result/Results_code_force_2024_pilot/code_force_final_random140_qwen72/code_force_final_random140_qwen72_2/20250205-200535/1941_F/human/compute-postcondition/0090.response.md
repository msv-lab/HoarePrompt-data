Postcondition: **`res` is initially set to infinity. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`) remain unchanged. If `start < s < end` is not true, `res` remains at its initial value (infinity).**
