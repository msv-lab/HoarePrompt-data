Postcondition: **_ is 0, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers greater than 0, k are integers from the input, a is a list of integers from the input, b is a sorted list of integers from the input, f is a sorted list of integers from the input, gap is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, start is the second element of the first tuple in gap, end is the third element of the first tuple in gap, mid is (start + end) // 2, nd is 0 if the length of gap is 1, otherwise nd is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is m-1, and res is the minimum value found during the loop execution of the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all valid s values within the range (start, end). If res was initially infinity (inf), it has been updated to a finite value.**
