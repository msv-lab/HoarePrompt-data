Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

    #State: After the loop completes all iterations, `_` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values from the last iteration's input. The lists `a`, `b`, and `f` will contain the values from the last iteration's input, with `b` and `f` being sorted. The list `gap` will contain tuples representing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple. The variables `start` and `end` will be the second and third elements of the first tuple in `gap`, respectively. The variable `mid` will be `(start + end) // 2`. The variable `nd` will be 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise it will be the first element of the second tuple in `gap`. The variable `i` will be `m - 1`, indicating the last index of the list `b`. The variable `j` will be the last computed index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[m-1]`. The variable `s` will be the last computed value of `f[j - 1] + b[m-1]` or `f[j] + b[m-1]` depending on the conditions. The variable `res` will be the minimum value found during the loop execution of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` values within the range `start < s < end`. If `res` was initially `inf`, it will remain `inf` if no valid `s` was found; otherwise, it will be updated to the minimum valid value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of inputs, each set representing a test case. For each test case, it takes integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a`, `b`, and `f` as inputs. It then calculates the optimal position to place a new element in the list `a` such that the maximum gap between any two adjacent elements is minimized. This is done by considering the gaps between consecutive elements in `a`, sorting these gaps, and then using binary search to find the best position for the new element. The function prints the minimum possible maximum gap for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
