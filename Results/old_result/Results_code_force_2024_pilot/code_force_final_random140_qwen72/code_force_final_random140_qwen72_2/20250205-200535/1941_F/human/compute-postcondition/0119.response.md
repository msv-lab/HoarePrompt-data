Output State: **`j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[x + 2]`, `res` is the value determined by the conditions described in the task, `i` is `x + 2`, `m` is greater than `x + 2`, `remain` is `mid - b[x + 2]`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is updated to the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`.
- The values of `res`, `i`, `m`, `remain`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the `bisect.bisect_left` function.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.
