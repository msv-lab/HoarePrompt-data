Postcondition: ***`res` is initially set to infinity. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start < s < end` where `s = f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value (initially infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1 but `s` is not between `start` and `end`, `res` remains infinity. If `j` is less than 1, `res` remains infinity. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`) remain unchanged.***
