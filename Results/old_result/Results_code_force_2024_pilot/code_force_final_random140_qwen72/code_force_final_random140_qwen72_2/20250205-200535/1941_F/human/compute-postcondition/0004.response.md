Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
