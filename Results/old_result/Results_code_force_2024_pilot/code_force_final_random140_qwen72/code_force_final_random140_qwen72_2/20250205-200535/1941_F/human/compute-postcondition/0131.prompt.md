Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is set to infinity (`inf`). All other variables retain their initial values: `_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers from the new input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input sorted in ascending order, `f` is a new list of integers from the new input sorted in ascending order, `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, where each tuple is `(y - x, x, y)` for consecutive elements `y` and `x` in `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is `m-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` is initially set to infinity. After the if-else block, if `j == k` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is not equal to `k`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `start < s < end` where `s = f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value (initially infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. In all other cases, `res` remains at its initial value (infinity). All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`res` is the value determined by the conditions described in the task, `i` is `x + 1`, `m` is greater than `x + 1`, `remain` is `mid - b[x + 1]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `j == k` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and `j >= 1` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and either `j < 1` or `s` is not within the range `start < s < end`, none of the variables are modified. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[x + 2]`, `i` is `x + 2`, `m` is greater than `x + 2`, `remain` is `mid - b[x + 2]`. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and `j >= 1`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of the previous `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and `j < 1`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of the previous `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `s` is not within the range `start < s < end`, `res` remains unchanged. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
