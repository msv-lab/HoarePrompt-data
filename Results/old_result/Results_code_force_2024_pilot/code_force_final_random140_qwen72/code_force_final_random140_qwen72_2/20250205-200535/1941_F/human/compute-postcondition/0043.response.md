Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 1, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `remain` would fit to maintain the sorted order of `f`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
