Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `3 * ((d + 1) // 2)`, `i` is 2, `d` is `(d - (d + 1) // 2)`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d` is updated to `d - (d + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The new value of `d` is calculated as `d - (d + 1) // 2`. For example, if `d` was 3, then `d` becomes `3 - (3 + 1) // 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`.
- The value of `s` remains `3 * ((d + 1) // 2)`, but since `d` has changed, `s` will also change if `d` changes. However, since `s` is not recalculated in the given code, its value remains as it was before the execution of the code.
