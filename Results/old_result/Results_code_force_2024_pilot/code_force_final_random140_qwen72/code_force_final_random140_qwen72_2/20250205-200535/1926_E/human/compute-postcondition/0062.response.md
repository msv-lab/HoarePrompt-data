To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `p <= i - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`.

2. **Initial State of the Variables:**
   - `p` is 1.
   - `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`.

3. **Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `p <= i - 1`.
   - Substituting the initial values, the condition becomes `1 <= i - 1`.

4. **Simplify the Condition:**
   - Simplifying `1 <= i - 1` gives `2 <= i`.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 2.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is at least 2. All other states remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and `i` must be at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**
