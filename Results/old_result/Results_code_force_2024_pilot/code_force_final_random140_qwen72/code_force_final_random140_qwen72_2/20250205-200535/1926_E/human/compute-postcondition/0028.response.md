Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `k`, `i` is at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2)`, `p` is 2, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to `h - (h + 1) // 2`.
- Initially, `h` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- After the update, `h` becomes `((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `p`, `g`) remain unchanged.
