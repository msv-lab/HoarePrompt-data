The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. For each test case, if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the function calculates a value `y` using a specific algorithm and prints it. If `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the function prints `2 * k - 1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
