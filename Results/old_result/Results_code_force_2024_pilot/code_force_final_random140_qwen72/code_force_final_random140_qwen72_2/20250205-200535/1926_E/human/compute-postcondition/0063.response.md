Initial State: - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 2.

Code:
```
g += (h + 1) // 2
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. The expression `(h + 1) // 2` is evaluated.
2. The result of this expression is added to the current value of `g`.
3. The new value of `g` is updated.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `g` and `h`, we can only say that `g` is updated by adding the result of `(h + 1) // 2` to its current value. The value of `i` remains at least 2, and no other variables are mentioned or affected.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`**.
