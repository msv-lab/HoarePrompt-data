Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `3 * ((d + 1) // 2)`, `i` is 3, `d` is `(d - (d + 1) // 2)`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
