Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is increased by 1, `h` is further reduced by `(h + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is first updated to `h - (h + 1) // 2`.
- Then, the code snippet `h -= (h + 1) // 2` further reduces `h` by `(h + 1) // 2`.
- The values of `i`, `g`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial state.
