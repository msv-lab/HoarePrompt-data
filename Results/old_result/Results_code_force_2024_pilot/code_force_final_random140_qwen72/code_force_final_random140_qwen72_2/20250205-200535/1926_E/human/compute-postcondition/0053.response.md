To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while s < k and d > 0:
```

The loop will execute again if both conditions are true:
1. `s < k`
2. `d > 0`

Let's examine the current state:
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `s < k`:**
   - `s` is calculated as `(d + 1) // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `s` must be less than `k`.

2. **Condition `d > 0`:**
   - `d` is calculated as `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusting the States:
- **Adjusting `s`:**
  - Since `s` is derived from `d`, we need to ensure that `d` is such that `s` remains less than `k`.
  - If `d` is adjusted, `s` will change accordingly.

- **Adjusting `d`:**
  - `d` must remain positive for the loop to continue.
  - Given `d = (n - (n + 1) // 2)`, `d` is already defined based on `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute again if `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0.
- Since `d` is already defined and must remain positive, we need to ensure that `s` is less than `k`.

Given the current state:
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure:
- `s` is less than `k`
- `d` is greater than 0

Since `d` is already defined and must remain positive, we need to ensure that `s` is less than `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2` and `s` must be less than `k`, `i` is 1, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)` and `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**
