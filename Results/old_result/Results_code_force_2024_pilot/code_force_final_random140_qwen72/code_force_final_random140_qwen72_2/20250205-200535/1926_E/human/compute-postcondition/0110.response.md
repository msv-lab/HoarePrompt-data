To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while p <= i - 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and they are the values read from the input
- `s` is equal to `k`
- `d` is 0
- `h` is `n - (n + 1) // 2 - ((n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2)`
- `p` is 3
- `g` is (`n` + 1) // 2 + (`h` + 1) // 2
- `f` is undefined
- `y` is undefined
- `i` is at least 2

We need to check the condition `p <= i - 1`:
- `p` is 3
- `i` is at least 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `p` is 3, we need `i - 1` to be at least 3, which means `i` must be at least 4.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is at least 4.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n - (n + 1) // 2 - ((n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2)`, `p` is 3, `g` is (`n` + 1) // 2 + (`h` + 1) // 2, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, and `i` is at least 4**
