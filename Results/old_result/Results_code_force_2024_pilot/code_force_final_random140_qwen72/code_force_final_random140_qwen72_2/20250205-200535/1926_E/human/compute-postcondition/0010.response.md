Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `s` is 0.
- The expression `(d + 1) // 2` is evaluated, where `d` is initially `n`.
- The result of `(d + 1) // 2` is added to `s`, making `s` equal to `(d + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`) remain unchanged.
