Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, and `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach or exceed `k`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`.
- In each iteration, `g` is incremented by `(h + 1) // 2`, and `h` is decremented by the same value.
- `p` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- After `i` iterations, `p` will be equal to `i`, and `h` will be 0 because it is continuously reduced by `(h + 1) // 2` until it reaches 0.
- The value of `g` will be the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `f`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
