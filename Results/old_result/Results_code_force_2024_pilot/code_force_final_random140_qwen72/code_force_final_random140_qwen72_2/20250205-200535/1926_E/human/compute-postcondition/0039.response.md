Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `k` is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2.
- Other variables (`s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`) are defined but not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `2 * k - 1`:

1. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
2. `k` is also constrained by `k` ≤ (n + 1) // 2, which means `k` is at most half of `n` plus one.

Given these constraints, the expression `2 * k - 1` will always produce an odd number because:
- Multiplying `k` by 2 results in an even number.
- Subtracting 1 from an even number results in an odd number.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be an odd number that is calculated as `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n and k ≤ (n + 1) // 2)**
