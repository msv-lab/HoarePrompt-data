Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 1, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)` and `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + (d + 1) // 2`.
- Initially, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`.
- After the update, `s` becomes `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
