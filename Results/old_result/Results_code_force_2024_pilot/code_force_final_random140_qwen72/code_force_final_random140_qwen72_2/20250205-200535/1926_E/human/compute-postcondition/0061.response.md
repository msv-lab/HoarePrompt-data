Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: These values are read from the input and remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`s`**: The variable `s` starts at 0 and increments by `(d + 1) // 2` in each iteration. The loop continues until `s` reaches or exceeds `k`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `s` will be equal to `k`.
- **`i`**: This variable counts the number of iterations the loop has executed. It starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. After the loop finishes, `i` will be the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`.
- **`d`**: The variable `d` starts at `n` and decreases by `(d + 1) // 2` in each iteration. After the loop finishes, `d` will be 0 because the loop stops when `d` is no longer greater than 0.
- **`h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged from their initial values.
