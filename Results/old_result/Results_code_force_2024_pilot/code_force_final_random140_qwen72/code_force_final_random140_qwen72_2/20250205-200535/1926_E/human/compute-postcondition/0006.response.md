Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
