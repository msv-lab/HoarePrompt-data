Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p`. Since `p` was already initialized to 1 in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `p`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
