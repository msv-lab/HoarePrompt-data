To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `s < k` and `d > 0`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `n` and `k` are the values read from the input
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`
- `d` must be greater than 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `f` is undefined
- `y` is undefined
- `i` is 2

### Loop Condition Analysis:
- The loop will continue as long as `s < k` and `d > 0`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Condition `d > 0`:**
   - `d` is defined as `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `d` must remain greater than 0. Since `d` is derived from `n`, and `n` is a constant value read from the input, `d` will not change unless `n` changes. However, since `n` is a constant, `d` will remain the same.

2. **Condition `s < k`:**
   - `s` is defined as `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`.
   - Simplifying, `s = (d + 1) // 2 * 2 = d + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `s` must be less than `k`.
   - Given that `s = d + 1`, the condition becomes `d + 1 < k`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `d` must remain greater than 0, and `d + 1` must be less than `k`.
- Since `d` is derived from `n` and `n` is a constant, `d` will not change.
- Therefore, the only way to ensure the loop can execute again is to ensure that `d + 1 < k`.

### Final State:
Since `d` is a constant derived from `n`, and `n` is a constant, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `d + 1 < k`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`, `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `i` is 2, and `d + 1 < k`**.
