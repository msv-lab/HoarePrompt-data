Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `n` and `k` are the values read from the input.
- `s` is equal to `k`.
- `d` is 0.
- `h` is 0.
- `p` is `i` (assuming `i` is a predefined variable, but it doesn't affect the print statement).
- `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `f` is `k - g`.
- `y` is 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `y` is explicitly set to 2.
- The value of `y` does not depend on any other variables or conditions in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will print the value of `y`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
