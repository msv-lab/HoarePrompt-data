Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is increased by 1, `h` is further reduced by `(h + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is increased by 1.
- The values of `i`, `g`, and `h` remain as they were after the previous updates.
- `i` is still at least 2.
- `g` is still updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`.
- `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2` and is further reduced by `(h + 1) // 2`.
