Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

The value of `s` was already 0 in the initial state, so the assignment `s = 0` does not change the value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
