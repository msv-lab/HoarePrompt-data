The value of `p` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `p` is 2, so after the increment, `p` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `k`, `i` is at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2)`, `p` is 3, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
