To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `p <= i - 1`.

### Initial State:
- `p` is 1
- `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach or exceed `k`

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `p <= i - 1` must be true for the loop to execute.
- Given that `p` is 1, the condition simplifies to `1 <= i - 1`.
- This further simplifies to `i >= 2`.

### Conclusion:
- For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 2.

### Adjusted State:
Since `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 2. All other states remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, and `i` is at least 2**.
