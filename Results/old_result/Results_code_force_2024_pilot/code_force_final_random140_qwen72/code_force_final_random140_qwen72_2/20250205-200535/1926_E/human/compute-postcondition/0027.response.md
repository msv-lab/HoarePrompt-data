Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `k`, `i` is at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated by adding `(h + 1) // 2` to its current value.
- The current value of `g` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `h` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- Therefore, the new value of `g` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
