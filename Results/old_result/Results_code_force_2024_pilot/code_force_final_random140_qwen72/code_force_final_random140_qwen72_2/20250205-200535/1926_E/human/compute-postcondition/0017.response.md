To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while s < k and d > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `s < k`**
   - `s` is defined as `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`.
   - Simplifying, `s = (d + 1) // 2 * 2 = d + 1`.
   - Therefore, the condition `s < k` translates to `d + 1 < k`.

2. **Condition 2: `d > 0`**
   - `d` is defined as `((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2)`.
   - Simplifying, `d = (n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`.
   - Let's break this down further:
     - `a = (n + 1) // 2` (integer division)
     - `b = n - a`
     - `c = (b + 1) // 2`
     - `d = b - c`
   - Substituting back, `d = (n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`.
- `i` is 2.
- `d` is `((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2)`.
- `h` is `n`.
- `p` is 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `s < k` and `d > 0` must be true.
- From the current state, `s = d + 1`.
- Therefore, `d + 1 < k` must hold true.
- Additionally, `d > 0` must hold true.

### Conclusion:
- The current state already satisfies `d > 0` because `d` is calculated based on `n` and `k`, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.
- To ensure `s < k`, we need to ensure that `d + 1 < k`.

Since `d` and `k` are derived from `n` and `k` and the current state already satisfies the conditions, no adjustments are needed.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 2, `d` is `((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2)`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`**.
