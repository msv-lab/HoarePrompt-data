You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to correctly handle certain cases. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the placement of cards that are multiples of odd numbers beyond the initial set of odd numbers. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Odd Numbers Handling**: The program correctly handles the placement of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, ...). For \( k \leq (n + 1) // 2 \), it prints \( 2k - 1 \), which is correct.

2. **Multiples of Odd Numbers**: The program attempts to handle multiples of odd numbers (2 * odd, 4 * odd, etc.), but it does not correctly account for the order in which these multiples should be placed. The logic used to calculate the position and value of these multiples is flawed.

3. **Edge Case**: Consider the input \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 5 \). According to the problem description, the 5th card laid down should be 2. However, the program incorrectly calculates this value.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
- Input: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 5 \)
- Expected Output: 2
- Actual Output: 4

The program incorrectly places the 5th card as 4 instead of 2. This indicates that the logic for handling multiples of odd numbers is incorrect, leading to the program being marked as incorrect.
