Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2 - (h - (h + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, `p` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains at least 2.
- `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`.
- `h` is first reduced by `(h + 1) // 2`, and then further reduced by `(h - (h + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`.
- `p` is increased by 1.
