Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 3, `d` is `((n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2) - ((d + 1) // 2)`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
