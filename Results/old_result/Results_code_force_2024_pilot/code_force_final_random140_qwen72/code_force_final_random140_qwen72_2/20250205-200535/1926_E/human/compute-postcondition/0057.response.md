To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `s < k` and `d > 0`.

### Current State:
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`
- `d` must be greater than 0
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `s < k`:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `s` must be less than `k`.
   - The value of `s` is calculated as `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `d + 1`.
   - Therefore, `s = d + 1`.
   - To satisfy `s < k`, we need `d + 1 < k`, which means `d < k - 1`.

2. **Condition `d > 0`:**
   - This condition is already satisfied as `d` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The value of `d` must be such that `d < k - 1` and `d > 0`.

### Conclusion:
Since the only variables in the loop head are `s` and `d`, and `s` is derived from `d`, we need to ensure that `d` is adjusted to a value that satisfies both conditions. Specifically, `d` must be greater than 0 and less than `k - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer such that 0 < d < k - 1, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**
