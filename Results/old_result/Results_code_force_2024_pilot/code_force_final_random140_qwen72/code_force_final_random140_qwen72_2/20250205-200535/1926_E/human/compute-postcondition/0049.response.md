To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while s < k and d > 0:
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `s` (initially 0)
- `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9)
- `d` (initially `n`)

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. `s < k`: For the loop to execute, `s` must be less than `k`.
2. `d > 0`: For the loop to execute, `d` must be greater than 0.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `s` is 0.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `d` is `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Condition 1 (`s < k`)**: Since `s` is 0 and `k` is at least 1, this condition is already satisfied.
- **Condition 2 (`d > 0`)**: Since `d` is `n` and `n` is at least 1, this condition is also satisfied.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed because both conditions `s < k` and `d > 0` are already met with the given initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**
