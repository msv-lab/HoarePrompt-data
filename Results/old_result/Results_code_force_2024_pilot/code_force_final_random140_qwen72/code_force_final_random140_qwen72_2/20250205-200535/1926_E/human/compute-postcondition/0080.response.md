Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, and `y` is undefined. If `k` > `(n + 1) // 2`, then after the loop executes all iterations, `i` is at least 2, `g` is the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `h` is reduced by `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration until `p` equals `i`, `p` is equal to `i`, `f` is now equal to `k - g`, and `y` is now equal to 2. If `k` ≤ `(n + 1) // 2`, then `i`, `g`, `p`, `f`, and `y` remain unchanged.***
