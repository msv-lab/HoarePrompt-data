The value of `xor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `i`. Since `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, the new value of `xor` will be the result of `xor` XOR `i`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list or contains the first element of `cur_arr`, and `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`.**
