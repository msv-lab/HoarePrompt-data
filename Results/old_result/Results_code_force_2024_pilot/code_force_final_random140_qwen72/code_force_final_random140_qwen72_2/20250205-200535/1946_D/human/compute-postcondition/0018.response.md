Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor`, and `xor` is now `xor ^ i`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`.
- The value of `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`, where `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
