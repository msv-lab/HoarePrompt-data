Functionality: ** The function `find_new` takes a list of integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit < 30) as parameters. It returns an integer based on the following conditions: 

1. If `bit` is -1, the function returns the length of `cur_arr`.
2. If the bit at position `bit` in the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` is set to 1, the function returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`.
3. If the bit at position `bit` in the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` is 0 and there are intermediate XOR results with the bit at position `bit` set to 0, the function returns the result of `find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)`, where `new_arr` contains these intermediate XOR results.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns -1.

The function is designed to explore the properties of the XOR operation on the elements of `cur_arr` and to find specific lengths or values based on the bit positions. The input list `cur_arr` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
