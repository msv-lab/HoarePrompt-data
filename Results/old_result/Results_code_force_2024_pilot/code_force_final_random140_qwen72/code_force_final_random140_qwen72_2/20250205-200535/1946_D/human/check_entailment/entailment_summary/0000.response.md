### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number `k` such that we can partition the array into `k` segments where the bitwise OR of the XOR of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The constraints ensure that the solution should be efficient enough to handle up to 10^5 elements in the array and up to 10^4 test cases.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**:
     - This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`.
     - The parameter `30` is likely chosen because the maximum value of any element in the array is less than \(2^{30}\), meaning the highest bit position to consider is 29 (0-indexed).

   - **`find_new(cur_arr, bit)`**:
     - This function recursively processes the array by considering one bit position at a time, starting from the most significant bit (30) down to the least significant bit (0).
     - The function maintains a running XOR (`xor`) of the elements in `cur_arr` and checks if the current bit position (`bit`) is set in this XOR.
     - If the bit is set, it means the current segment cannot be included in the final partition without violating the condition. In this case, it either returns -1 or continues to the next bit position.
     - If the bit is not set, it appends the current XOR to a new array (`new_arr`) and resets the running XOR.
     - The function returns the maximum number of valid segments found by recursively calling itself with the next bit position.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `find_new` correctly handles the partitioning of the array based on the bitwise conditions.
   - The recursion ensures that all bit positions are considered, and the function returns the maximum number of valid segments.
   - The base case when `bit == -1` returns the length of the current array, which is the number of valid segments found.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by partitioning the array and ensuring the bitwise conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
