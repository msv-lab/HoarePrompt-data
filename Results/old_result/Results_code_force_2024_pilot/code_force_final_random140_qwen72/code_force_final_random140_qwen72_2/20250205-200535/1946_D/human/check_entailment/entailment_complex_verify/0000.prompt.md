You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:

- Annotated Code: 
testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30.
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_new(arr, 30)
    #The program returns the result of the function `find_new` applied to the list `arr` and the integer 30. The exact value depends on the implementation of `find_new`, but it operates on a list of non-negative integers, each less than 2^30, and an integer 30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers where each element is less than \(2^{30}\) and a non-negative integer `x` also less than \(2^{30}\). It returns the result of the function `find_new` applied to `arr` and the integer 30. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `find_new`. After the function concludes, the list `arr` and the integer `x` remain unchanged, and the function has no side effects on other parts of the program.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially. `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. `xor` is 0 if the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` has the bit at position `bit` set to 0; otherwise, `xor` is the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = len(new_arr)
    #State: *`cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially, `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(thing1, find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1))
        #The program returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. Here, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and `thing1` is -1. The function `find_new` is called with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments, and its result is compared with -1 to determine the final return value.
    else :
        if (thing1 != -1) :
            return find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)
            #The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Here, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0, and `bit - 1` is an integer such that 0 <= bit - 1 < 30.
        #State: *`cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially, `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`. Additionally, `thing1` is -1.

The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`. Additionally, `thing1` is -1.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_new` takes a list of integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit < 30) as parameters. It returns an integer based on the following conditions: 

1. If `bit` is -1, the function returns the length of `cur_arr`.
2. If the bit at position `bit` in the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` is set to 1, the function returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`.
3. If the bit at position `bit` in the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` is 0 and there are intermediate XOR results with the bit at position `bit` set to 0, the function returns the result of `find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)`, where `new_arr` contains these intermediate XOR results.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns -1.

The function is designed to explore the properties of the XOR operation on the elements of `cur_arr` and to find specific lengths or values based on the bit positions. The input list `cur_arr` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here’s a breakdown of why the program seems to be correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calls `find_new` with the array and a bit value of 30. This is appropriate because the problem specifies that \( x \) is less than \( 2^{30} \), meaning the highest bit position to consider is 30.

2. **Function `find_new`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of the current array. This is correct because if no bits are left to consider, the number of segments is simply the length of the current array.
   - **XOR Calculation**: It iterates through the array, maintaining a running XOR (`xor`). If the current bit position (`bit`) of the running XOR is not set, it appends the current XOR to `new_arr` and resets `xor`.
   - **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if the final `xor` has the current bit position set. If it does, `thing1` is set to -1; otherwise, it is set to the length of `new_arr`.
   - **Recursive Call**: Depending on whether the current bit of `x` is set, it either takes the maximum of `thing1` and the result of the recursive call with the next lower bit, or it recursively calls `find_new` with `new_arr` and the next lower bit.
   - **Return Value**: If `thing1` is not -1 and the current bit of `x` is not set, it recursively calls `find_new` with `new_arr` and the next lower bit. Otherwise, it returns -1.

The logic ensures that the program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem, including the bitwise operations and the conditions for segment selection. Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of edge cases, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
