To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur_arr`. The loop will execute if `cur_arr` contains at least one element. The other variables (`bit`, `new_arr`, and `xor`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `cur_arr` is a list of integers.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not -1.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `xor` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `cur_arr`.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0**
