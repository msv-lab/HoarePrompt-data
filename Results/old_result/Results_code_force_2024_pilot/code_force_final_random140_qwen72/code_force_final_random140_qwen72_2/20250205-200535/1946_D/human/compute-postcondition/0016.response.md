The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `new_arr` also contains `xor`, and `xor` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to move to the next element in `cur_arr`. Since `i` was the second element, it will now be the third element. The list `cur_arr` must still have at least three elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `new_arr` also contains `xor`, and `xor` is 0.**
