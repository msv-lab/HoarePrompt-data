Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program seems to be correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calls `find_new` with the array and a bit value of 30. This is appropriate because the problem specifies that \( x \) is less than \( 2^{30} \), meaning the highest bit position to consider is 30.

2. **Function `find_new`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of the current array. This is correct because if no bits are left to consider, the number of segments is simply the length of the current array.
   - **XOR Calculation**: It iterates through the array, maintaining a running XOR (`xor`). If the current bit position (`bit`) of the running XOR is not set, it appends the current XOR to `new_arr` and resets `xor`.
   - **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if the final `xor` has the current bit position set. If it does, `thing1` is set to -1; otherwise, it is set to the length of `new_arr`.
   - **Recursive Call**: Depending on whether the current bit of `x` is set, it either takes the maximum of `thing1` and the result of the recursive call with the next lower bit, or it recursively calls `find_new` with `new_arr` and the next lower bit.
   - **Return Value**: If `thing1` is not -1 and the current bit of `x` is not set, it recursively calls `find_new` with `new_arr` and the next lower bit. Otherwise, it returns -1.

The logic ensures that the program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem, including the bitwise operations and the conditions for segment selection. Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of edge cases, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
