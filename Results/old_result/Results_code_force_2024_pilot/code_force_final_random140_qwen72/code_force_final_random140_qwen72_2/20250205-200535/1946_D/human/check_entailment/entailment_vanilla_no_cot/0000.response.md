Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified. The function `func_1` calls `find_new` with a fixed bit value of 30, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to consider the bitwise OR of XOR segments up to a limit `x`. The function `find_new` attempts to process the array at different bit levels, but it does not properly handle the conditions for forming valid segments or checking against the limit `x`.

To solve this problem correctly, the algorithm should:
1. Iterate through the array while maintaining the current XOR value.
2. Check if adding the next element to the current segment would still allow the bitwise OR of all segments to be less than or equal to `x`.
3. If not, start a new segment.
4. Keep track of the number of segments formed and ensure that the final result meets the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The provided code does not seem to follow these steps accurately, leading to potential incorrect results for various test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
