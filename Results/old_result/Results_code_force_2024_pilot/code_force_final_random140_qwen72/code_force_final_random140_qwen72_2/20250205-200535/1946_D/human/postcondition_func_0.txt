The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers where each element is less than \(2^{30}\) and a non-negative integer `x` also less than \(2^{30}\). It returns the result of the function `find_new` applied to `arr` and the integer 30. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `find_new`. After the function concludes, the list `arr` and the integer `x` remain unchanged, and the function has no side effects on other parts of the program.
