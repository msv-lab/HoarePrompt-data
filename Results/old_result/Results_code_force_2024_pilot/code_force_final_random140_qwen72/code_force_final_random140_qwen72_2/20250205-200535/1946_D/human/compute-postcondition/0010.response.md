Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list or contains the first element of `cur_arr`, and `xor` is either 0 or remains equal to the first element of `cur_arr` depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0 or 1.***
