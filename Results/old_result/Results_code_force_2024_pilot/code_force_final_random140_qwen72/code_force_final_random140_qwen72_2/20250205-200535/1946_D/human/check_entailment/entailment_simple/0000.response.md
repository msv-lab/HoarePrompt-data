### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1]`, `[l_2, r_2]`, ..., `[l_k, r_k]` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The constraints ensure that the input is valid and within reasonable limits.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one using the function `func_1`.
   - `func_1` calls `find_new` with the array and a fixed bit value of 30.

3. **Function `find_new`**:
   - This function recursively processes the array by considering each bit from 30 down to 0.
   - It maintains a list `new_arr` to store intermediate XOR results where the current bit is 0.
   - It checks if the current bit in `x` is set and makes decisions accordingly:
     - If the bit in `x` is set, it returns the maximum of the current segment count (`thing1`) and the result of the next recursive call.
     - If the bit in `x` is not set, it returns the result of the next recursive call with `new_arr`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the base case when `bit` is -1 by returning the length of `cur_arr`.
   - It correctly handles the case where no valid segments can be formed by returning -1.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments.
   - The recursive approach ensures that all bits are considered, and the conditions for the bitwise OR and XOR operations are met.
   - The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
