The code snippet sets `xor` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `xor`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor`, `xor` is 0.**
