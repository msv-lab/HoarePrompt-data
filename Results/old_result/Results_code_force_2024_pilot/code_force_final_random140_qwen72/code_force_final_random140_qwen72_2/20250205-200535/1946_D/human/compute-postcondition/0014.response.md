Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor`, `xor` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `xor` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `xor`, which was the result of `xor` XOR `i`. All other variables (`cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, `new_arr`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `xor` and retains the initial conditions for the other variables.
