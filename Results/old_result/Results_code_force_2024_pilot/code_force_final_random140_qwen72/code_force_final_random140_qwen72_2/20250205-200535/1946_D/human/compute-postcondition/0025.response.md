Output State: **`cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0, `xor` is the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, and the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the length of `new_arr` to the variable `thing1`. All other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`) remain unchanged. The value of `thing1` is now the number of elements in `new_arr`.
