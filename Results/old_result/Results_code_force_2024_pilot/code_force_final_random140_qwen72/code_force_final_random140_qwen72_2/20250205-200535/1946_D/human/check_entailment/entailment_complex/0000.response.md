### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1]`, `[l_2, r_2]`, ..., `[l_k, r_k]` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Each segment must satisfy the conditions: `l_1 = 1`, `r_k = n`, `l_i â‰¤ r_i`, and `r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**:
     - This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`, which suggests that it is trying to solve the problem by considering the highest bit (30th bit) first and working downwards.
   - **`find_new(cur_arr, bit)`**:
     - This function recursively processes the array by considering the current bit (`bit`).
     - If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`, which represents the number of segments.
     - It calculates the XOR of elements in `cur_arr` and checks if the bit at position `bit` is set.
     - If the bit is set, it returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`.
     - If the bit is not set, it creates a new array `new_arr` containing intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` is 0.
     - It then recursively calls `find_new` with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `find_new` correctly handles the recursive breakdown of the problem by considering each bit from the highest to the lowest.
   - It ensures that the segments are formed such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The base case when `bit` is -1 correctly returns the length of the current array, which represents the number of segments.
   - The recursive calls and the conditions ensure that the segments are formed in a way that meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
