The value of `xor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `i`. Since `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, the new value of `xor` will be the result of `xor` XOR `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `new_arr` also contains `xor`, and `xor` is now `xor ^ i`.**
