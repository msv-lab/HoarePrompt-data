Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is now an empty set, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1. If `n` is 2, `i` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, the value of `ans` will depend on the sequence of differences between consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2`. If any difference `s[i] - s[i-1]` is greater than 1, the loop breaks and `ans` retains its last value before the break. If no such difference is found, `ans` will toggle between 0 and 1 for each iteration, ending with either 0 or 1 depending on the number of iterations and the initial value of `ans`. If `ans` was initially true (non-zero), it remains true. If `ans` was initially false (zero), it remains false.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s.add(arr[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` contains `arr[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` contains `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
