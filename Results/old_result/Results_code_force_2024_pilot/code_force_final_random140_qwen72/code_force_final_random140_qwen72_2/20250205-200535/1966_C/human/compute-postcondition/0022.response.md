The value of `ans` is updated to `1 - ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 1, the new value of `ans` will be 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**
