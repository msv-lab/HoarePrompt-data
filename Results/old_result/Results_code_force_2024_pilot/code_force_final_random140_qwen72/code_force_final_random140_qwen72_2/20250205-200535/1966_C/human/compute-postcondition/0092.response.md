Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s = [0] + s` prepends the integer 0 to the list `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` contains all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. After the code execution, `s` now starts with 0 followed by these unique elements. The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
