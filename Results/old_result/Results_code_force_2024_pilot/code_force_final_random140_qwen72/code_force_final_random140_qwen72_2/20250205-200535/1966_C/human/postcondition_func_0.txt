The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines and prints the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the following rules: If the list of unique stone counts (including 0) has exactly two elements, Alice wins. Otherwise, the function iterates through the sorted unique stone counts and toggles a flag (`ans`) based on whether the difference between consecutive elements is 1. If the final value of `ans` is 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The function does not return any values but prints the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') for each test case.
