Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
2. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
3. `i` is `n - 2`.
4. `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.
5. The value of `ans` depends on the differences between consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2`. If any difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks and `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` toggles between 0 and 1 for each iteration, ending with the final value based on the number of iterations and the initial value of `ans`.
6. Additionally, `ans` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'Bob'`.
- The initial state provides a detailed description of the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will always print the string `'Bob'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
