The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `s` is an empty set.
- `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2 or determined based on the conditions described.

After executing the code:
- The set `s` now contains the element `arr[i]`, which is `arr[n-1]`.
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a set containing `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2 or determined based on the conditions described.**
