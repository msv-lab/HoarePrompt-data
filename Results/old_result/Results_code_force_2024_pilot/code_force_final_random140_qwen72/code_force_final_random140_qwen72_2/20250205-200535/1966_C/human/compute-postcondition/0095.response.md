Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.
- `ans` is 1.
- `n` is 2.

Given this information, let's break down the state of the program:

1. `n` is explicitly given as 2.
2. `i` is `n - 1`, so `i` is 1.
3. `s` is a list that starts with 0 and then contains all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. Since `n` is 2, `s` will contain 0 followed by the unique elements of `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables or their values. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Alice**
