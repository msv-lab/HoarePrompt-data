Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    ans = 1
    s = [0] + s
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans = 1 - ans
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1. If `n` is 2, `i` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, the value of `ans` will depend on the sequence of differences between consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2`. If any difference `s[i] - s[i-1]` is greater than 1, the loop breaks and `ans` retains its last value before the break. If no such difference is found, `ans` will toggle between 0 and 1 for each iteration, ending with either 0 or 1 depending on the number of iterations and the initial value of `ans`. If `ans` was initially true (non-zero), it remains true. If `ans` was initially false (zero), it remains false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will break as soon as it finds any two consecutive elements in `s` where the difference is greater than 1. If no such pair is found, `ans` will be 1 if the number of iterations is odd, and 0 if the number of iterations is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If `n` is 2, `ans` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 2`, and the value of `ans` depends on the differences between consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2`. If any difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks and `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` toggles between 0 and 1 for each iteration, ending with the final value based on the number of iterations and the initial value of `ans`. If the initial value of `ans` is 1, it remains 1. If the initial value of `ans` is 0, it remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
