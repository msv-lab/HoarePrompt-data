Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a set containing all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2 or determined based on the conditions described.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, adding each element of `arr` to the set `s`.
- After all iterations, `s` will contain all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.
- The variable `i` remains as `n - 1` because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
