The code snippet `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` based on its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` remains 1 if the condition is met, otherwise it is set to 0, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `ans` was initially 1 (because the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` was greater than 1), then `ans` will be set to 0.
2. If `ans` was initially 0 (because the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` was not greater than 1), then `ans` will be set to 1.

However, the initial state does not specify which case applies, so we need to consider both possibilities. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is 0 if it was initially 1, and `ans` is 1 if it was initially 0.**
