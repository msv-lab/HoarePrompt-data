Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is 1. Additionally, the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.***
