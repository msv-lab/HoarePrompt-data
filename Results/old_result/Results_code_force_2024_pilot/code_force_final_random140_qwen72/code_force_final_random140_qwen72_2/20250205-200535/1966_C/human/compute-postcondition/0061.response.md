The value of `ans` is updated to `1 - ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 1, the new value of `ans` will be `1 - 1`, which equals 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**
