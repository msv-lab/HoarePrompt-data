Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines the winner of the game. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the game outcome can be determined solely by the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes. This assumption fails to consider the actual rules of the game, where players must remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile.

A counterexample to illustrate this issue:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 2 3
  ```
  According to the problem description, Alice can win by choosing \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, leaving the piles as \( [0, 1, 2] \). On Bob's turn, he must choose \( k = 1 \) again, leaving the piles as \( [0, 0, 1] \). Alice then wins by choosing \( k = 1 \) on her next turn, leaving all piles empty.

However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this input because it only checks the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
