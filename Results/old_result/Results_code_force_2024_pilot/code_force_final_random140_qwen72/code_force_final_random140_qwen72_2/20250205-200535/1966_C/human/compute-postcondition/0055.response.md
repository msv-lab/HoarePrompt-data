Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended.
- `ans` is 1.
- `n` is 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `n`:**
   - Given: `n` is 2.

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - Since `n` is 2, `i` is `2-1` which is 1.

3. **Determine the value of `s`:**
   - `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended.
   - Since `n` is 2, `s` will contain elements from `arr` from index 0 to 1.
   - Let's assume `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements. For simplicity, let's say `arr = [a, b]`.
   - Therefore, `s` will be `[0, a, b]`.

4. **Determine the value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.
- The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `s`, and `ans` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
