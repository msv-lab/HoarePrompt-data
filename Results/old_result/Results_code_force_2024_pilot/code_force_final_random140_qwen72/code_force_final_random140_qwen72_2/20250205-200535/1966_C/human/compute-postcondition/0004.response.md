To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is a placeholder variable (not used in the loop head)
- `n` is a positive integer within the range of `t`
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `s` is an empty set

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be automatically initialized by the loop, starting from 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is an empty set, `i` is 0**
