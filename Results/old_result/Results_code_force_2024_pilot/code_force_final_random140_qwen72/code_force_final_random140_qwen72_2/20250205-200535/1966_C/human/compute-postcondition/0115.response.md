Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. The value of `ans` depends on the differences between consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2`. If any difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks and `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` toggles between 0 and 1 for each iteration, ending with the final value based on the number of iterations and the initial value of `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is 0.**
