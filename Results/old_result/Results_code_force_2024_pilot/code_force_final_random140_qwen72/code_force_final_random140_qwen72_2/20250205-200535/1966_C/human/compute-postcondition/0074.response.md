Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended. The loop will break as soon as it finds any two consecutive elements in `s` where the difference is greater than 1. If no such pair is found, `ans` will be 0 if the number of iterations is even, and 1 if the number of iterations is odd. Additionally, `ans` is 0.***
