To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n - 1)` is non-empty. This means that the starting value (1) must be less than the ending value (`n - 1`).
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, `1 < n - 1` must be true. Simplifying this, we get `n > 2`.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `_` is a placeholder variable (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr` (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is `n-1` (this will be adjusted by the loop itself).
- `ans` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is not equal to 2 (this is relevant to the loop condition).

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `n > 2`.
- The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, but this will be set by the loop itself when it starts.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder variable.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr`.
- `i` is `n-1` (but will be set by the loop).
- `ans` is 1.

### State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1**
