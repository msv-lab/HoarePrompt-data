The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer within the range of `t`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
