Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`**. 

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` (which is 1) of the array `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contained only `arr[0]`. After executing the code, `s` now contains both `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
