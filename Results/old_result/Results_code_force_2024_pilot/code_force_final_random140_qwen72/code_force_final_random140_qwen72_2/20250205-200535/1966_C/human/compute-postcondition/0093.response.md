Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the length of the list `s`. All other variables (`arr`, `i`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is now the number of unique elements in `arr` plus one (due to the leading 0 in `s`).
