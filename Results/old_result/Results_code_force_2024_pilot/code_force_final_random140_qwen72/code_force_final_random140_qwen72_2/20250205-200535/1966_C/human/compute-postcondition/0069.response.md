The code snippet `ans = 1 - ans` toggles the value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is set to 1 if `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1`. The value of `ans` will be flipped (from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1) by the given code. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended, `ans` is 0 if initially `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1` and `ans` is 1 if initially `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`.**
