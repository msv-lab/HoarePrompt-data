Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1 - `ans`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to `1 - ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `ans` depends on its previous value, which is now inverted (if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0).
