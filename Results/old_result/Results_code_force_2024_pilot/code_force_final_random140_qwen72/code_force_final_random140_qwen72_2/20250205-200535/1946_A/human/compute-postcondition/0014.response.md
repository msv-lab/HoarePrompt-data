Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the user's input, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains greater than 0, specifically `t` is now `t - 1`.
- The value of `n` is a new input integer.
- The list `a` is still a sorted list of integers derived from the user's input.
- The value of `p` is still `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- The value of `res` is updated to the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`. This means `res` is now the count of the element `a[p]` in the sublist starting from index `p` to the end of the list `a`.
