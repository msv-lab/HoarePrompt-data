Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, and `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` changes the value of `a` to a list of integers input by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `median_index`, `median`, `i`, and `operations`) remain unchanged, but their values are now based on the new list `a` provided by the user.
