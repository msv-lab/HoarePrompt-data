The value of `p` is calculated using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This formula first adds 1 to `n`, performs integer division by 2, and then subtracts 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the user's input, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.**
