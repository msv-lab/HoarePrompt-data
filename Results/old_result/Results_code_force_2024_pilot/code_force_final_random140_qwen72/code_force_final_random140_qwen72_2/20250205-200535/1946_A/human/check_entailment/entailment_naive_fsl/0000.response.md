Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program only counts the occurrences of the current median in the sorted array from the median position onwards, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The current median is 3. The program will output `3` because there are three elements equal to or greater than 3 from the median position onwards. However, the correct output should be `1`, as increasing the element at index 2 (which is 3) by 1 will change the array to `[1, 2, 4, 4, 5]`, and the new median will be 4, which is greater than the original median of 3.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
