The code snippet assigns the value of `a[median_index]` to the variable `median`. Given that `median_index` is `n // 2`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median` will now hold the value of the element at the middle index of the list `a`.

Since the initial state already specifies that `median` is the value of `a[n // 2]` in the sorted list, the assignment does not change the value of `median`. Therefore, the only change is the explicit assignment, which reaffirms the value of `median`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[n // 2]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.**
