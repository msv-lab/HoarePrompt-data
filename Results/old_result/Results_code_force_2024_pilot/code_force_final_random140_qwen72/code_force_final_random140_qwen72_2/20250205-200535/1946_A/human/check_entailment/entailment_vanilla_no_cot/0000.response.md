Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The issue lies in how the solution calculates the result. The current implementation counts the occurrences of the current median in the sub-array starting from the median position, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, the algorithm should focus on increasing the value of the current median element to the next unique value in the sorted array that is greater than the current median. This involves:

1. Sorting the array.
2. Identifying the current median.
3. Finding the smallest element in the array that is greater than the current median.
4. Calculating the number of operations required to make the current median equal to this next element.

The current implementation does not perform these steps correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
