Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[n // 2]` in the sorted list, `i` is 1, `operations` is `median - a[i]` if `a[i]` is less than the `median`, otherwise `operations` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `n` is still a new input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is still a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `median_index` is still `n // 2`.
- `median` is still the value of `a[n // 2]` in the sorted list.
- `i` is still 1.
- The value of `operations` is updated to `median - a[i]` if `a[i]` is less than the `median`. If `a[i]` is not less than the `median`, `operations` remains 0.
