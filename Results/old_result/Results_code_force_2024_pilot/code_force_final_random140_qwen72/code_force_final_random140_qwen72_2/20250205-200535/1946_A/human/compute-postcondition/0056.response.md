Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[n // 2]` in the sorted list, `i` is 2, `operations` is `median - a[2]` if `a[2]` is less than the `median`, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[2]` added to its previous value.**

Explanation:
- The value of `operations` is updated by adding `median - a[2]` to its current value.
- If `a[2]` is less than the `median`, `operations` becomes `median - a[2]`.
- If `a[2]` is not less than the `median`, `operations` remains `median - a[2]` added to its previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
