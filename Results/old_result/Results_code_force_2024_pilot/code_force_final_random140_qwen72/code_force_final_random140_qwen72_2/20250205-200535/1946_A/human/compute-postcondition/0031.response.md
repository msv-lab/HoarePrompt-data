The code snippet `operations += median - a[i]` increments the `operations` variable by the difference between `median` and the value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list
- `i` is 0
- `operations` is 0
- The current value of `a[i]` is less than `median`

After executing the code:

- `operations` is now `median - a[i]` (since `operations` was initially 0)
- All other variables remain unchanged

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is 0, `operations` is `median - a[i]`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median`.**
