Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, if the current element `a[i]` is less than the `median`, the difference `median - a[i]` is added to the `operations` variable.
- After all iterations, `operations` will contain the sum of all such differences for elements in the list `a` that are less than the `median`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
