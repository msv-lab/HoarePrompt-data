Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `a` are undefined (as they are re-initialized in each iteration), and the results of the operations (values of `res`) for each test case have been printed.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is reduced to 0 because it controls the number of test cases, and each iteration processes one test case. The variables `n` and `a` are re-initialized in each iteration, so they do not retain any specific values after the loop completes. The results of the operations (the values of `res` for each test case) have been printed to the console as the loop processed each test case.
