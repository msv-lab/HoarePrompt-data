Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[n // 2]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `median_index = n // 2` updates the value of `median_index` to be the integer division of `n` by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `median`, `i`, and `operations`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `median_index` is now explicitly defined as `n // 2`.
- The value of `median` is still the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, which is now `a[n // 2]`.
- The value of `operations` remains the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.
