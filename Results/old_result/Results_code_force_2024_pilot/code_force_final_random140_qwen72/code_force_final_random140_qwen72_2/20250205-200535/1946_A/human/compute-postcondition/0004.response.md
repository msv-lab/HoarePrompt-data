The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the string into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.**
