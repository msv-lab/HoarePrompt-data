Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal to the median of the array. The result for each test case is printed to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and no further input or output is expected. **
