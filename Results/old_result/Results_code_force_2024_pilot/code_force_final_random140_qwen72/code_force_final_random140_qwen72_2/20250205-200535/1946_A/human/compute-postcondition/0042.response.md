The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `n` was previously described as an input integer greater than 0, the new value of `n` also needs to satisfy this condition.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.**
