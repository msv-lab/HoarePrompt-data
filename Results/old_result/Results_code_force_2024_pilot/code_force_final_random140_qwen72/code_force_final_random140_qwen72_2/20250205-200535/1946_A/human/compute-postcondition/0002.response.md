The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its initial value is not relevant; it will be set by the loop itself.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
