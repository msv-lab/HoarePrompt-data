The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, and `i` is 2. If `a[1]` is less than `median`, `operations` is set to `2 * (median - a[1])`. Otherwise, `operations` remains 0.**
