Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]` where `a[j] < median` in the sorted list.**

Explanation:
- The code `median = a[median_index]` assigns the value of `a[median_index]` to the variable `median`.
- Since `median_index` is already defined as `n // 2`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median` now holds the value of the element at the middle index of the sorted list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `i`, `operations`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
