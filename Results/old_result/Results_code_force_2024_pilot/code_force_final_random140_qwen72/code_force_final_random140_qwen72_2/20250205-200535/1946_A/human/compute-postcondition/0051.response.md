Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[n // 2]` in the sorted list, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is less than the `median`, `operations` is set to `median - a[i]`. Otherwise, `operations` remains 0.***
