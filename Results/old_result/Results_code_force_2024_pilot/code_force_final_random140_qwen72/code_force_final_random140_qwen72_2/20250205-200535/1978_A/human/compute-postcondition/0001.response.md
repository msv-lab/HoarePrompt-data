The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The initial state of `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the range.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
