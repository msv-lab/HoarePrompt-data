The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a number of books and a list of the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the number of pages in the last book and the number of pages in the second-largest book. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the processed test cases being printed, and the internal variables used in the function are no longer relevant.
