The code snippet `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())` sorts the list `ls`, which contains strings, and then pops the last element from the sorted list. This popped element is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `other`.

- `ls` is a list of strings from user input with one less element (the last element has been removed).
- `sorted(ls)` sorts the list `ls` alphabetically.
- `.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the sorted list.
- `int(...)` converts the popped string to an integer.

Therefore, the variable `other` is assigned the largest integer value from the sorted list `ls`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings from user input with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from `ls`, `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted list `ls`.**
