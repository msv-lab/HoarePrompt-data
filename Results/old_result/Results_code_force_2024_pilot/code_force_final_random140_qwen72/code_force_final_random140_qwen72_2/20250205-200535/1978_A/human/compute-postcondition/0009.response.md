The code `ls = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This operation updates the value of `ls`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `ls` is a list of strings from user input with one less element
- `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from `ls`
- `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted list `ls`

After executing the code:
- `ls` is now a list of strings from the new user input, split by whitespace.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `last`, and `other` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings from the new user input, `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`, `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted previous `ls`.**
