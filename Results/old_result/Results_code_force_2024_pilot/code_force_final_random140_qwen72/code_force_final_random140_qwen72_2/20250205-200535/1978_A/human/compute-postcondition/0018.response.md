Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 2.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
4. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
5. `ls` is a list of strings from the new user input with one less element.
6. `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`.
7. `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(last + other)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`last`**: This variable holds the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`. Since `ls` is a list of strings with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the element that was removed.
2. **`other`**: This variable holds the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`. After removing the last element, `ls` is sorted, and `other` is the largest value in this sorted list.

### Calculation:
- The `print` statement will add the value of `last` and `other` and print the result.
- Since `last` is the integer value of the removed element and `other` is the largest integer value in the current `ls`, the output will be the sum of these two values.

### Final Output:
Output: **last + other (where last is the integer value of the last element removed from the previous ls, and other is the largest integer value from the sorted current ls)**

This output provides a clear and precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
