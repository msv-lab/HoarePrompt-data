Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program always takes the last element of the list and the largest element of the remaining list, which does not necessarily give the maximum sum of the highest pages in two piles. 

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
```
1
4
2 3 3 1
```
- Expected Output:
```
6
```
- Actual Output from the program:
```
4
```

In this case, the optimal division would be to place the books with 3 pages in each pile, resulting in a total of 6 pages read. However, the program incorrectly outputs 4, because it only considers the last element and the largest of the rest, which is not the correct approach to maximize the sum of the highest pages in two piles.
