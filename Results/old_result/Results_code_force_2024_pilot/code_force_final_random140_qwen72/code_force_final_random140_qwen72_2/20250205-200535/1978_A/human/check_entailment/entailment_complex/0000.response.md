Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by selecting the last book (which is not necessarily the largest) and the second-largest book from the remaining books. However, this approach is flawed because it does not always ensure that the two largest books are selected, which is necessary to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 3 3 1
```
The program will:
1. Read the input as `['2', '3', '3']`.
2. Pop the last element (`1`) and store it in `last`.
3. Sort the remaining elements (`['2', '3', '3']`), pop the last element (`3`), and store it in `other`.
4. Print `1 + 3 = 4`.

However, the correct solution should be `3 + 3 = 6` because the two largest books have 3 pages each.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
