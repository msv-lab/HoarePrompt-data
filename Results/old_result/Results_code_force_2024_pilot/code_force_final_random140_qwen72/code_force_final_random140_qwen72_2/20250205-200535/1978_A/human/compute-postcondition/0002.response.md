The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through the `input()` function. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, the new value of `n` should also satisfy this condition.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 (updated from user input), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
