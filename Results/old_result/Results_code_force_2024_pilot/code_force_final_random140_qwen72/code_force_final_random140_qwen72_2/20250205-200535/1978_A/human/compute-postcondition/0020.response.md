The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it should accept:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it should accept:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the prompt. Assuming the function returns some form of processed data related to the number of pages in the books for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of books and a list of the number of pages in each book. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
