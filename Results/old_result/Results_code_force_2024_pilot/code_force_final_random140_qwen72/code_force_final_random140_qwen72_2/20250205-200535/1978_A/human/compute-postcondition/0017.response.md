The code snippet `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())` sorts the list `ls`, removes and returns the last (largest) element from the sorted list, and assigns the integer value of this element to the variable `other`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `ls` is a list of strings from the new user input with one less element (the last element has been removed)
- `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`
- `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`

After executing the code:
- `other` is now the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ls`, and `last` remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings from the new user input with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`, `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`.**
