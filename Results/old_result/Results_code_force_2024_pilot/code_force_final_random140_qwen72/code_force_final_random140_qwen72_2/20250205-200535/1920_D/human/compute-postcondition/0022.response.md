The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables during this iteration, but the loop control flow is affected.

Output State: **`i` is `f - 3`, `f` is greater than 0, and if `a[2 * (f - 3)]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
