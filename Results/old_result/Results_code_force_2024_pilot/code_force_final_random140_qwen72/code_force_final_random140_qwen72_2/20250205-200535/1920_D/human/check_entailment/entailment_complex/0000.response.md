### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes an array `a` with a single element `[0]` and a dictionary `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`.

2. **Processing Operations:**
   - The program iterates through each operation.
   - If the operation is of type 1 (`d & 1`), it appends the integer `e` to the array `a` and updates the dictionary `b` with the new length of `a` and the value `e`.
   - If the operation is of type 2, it appends `e` copies of the current array `a` to itself, effectively multiplying its length by `e + 1`.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program reverses the array `a` and then processes the queries.
   - For each query, it calls the function `func_1` to find the k-th element in the array `a`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` representing the k-th element to be queried.
   - If `x` is directly in the dictionary `b`, it returns the value associated with `x`.
   - If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through each element `i` in the reversed array `a`, updating `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`.
   - If the updated `x` becomes an element of `b` during the iteration, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`.
   - If no such `x` is found in `b` after iterating through all elements in `a`, the function does not return any value, effectively returning `None`.

### Issues:
- **Reversing the Array `a`:** Reversing the array `a` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The array should be processed in its original order.
- **Handling Large Arrays:** The program does not handle large arrays efficiently. The array `a` can grow exponentially, and reversing it can be very costly.
- **Function `func_1`:** The function `func_1` does not handle the case where `x` is not found in `b` correctly. It should return a default value or handle this case more gracefully.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues that affect its correctness and efficiency. The main problems are the unnecessary reversal of the array and the inefficient handling of large arrays. Additionally, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where `x` is not found in `b` correctly.

Correctness: **False**
