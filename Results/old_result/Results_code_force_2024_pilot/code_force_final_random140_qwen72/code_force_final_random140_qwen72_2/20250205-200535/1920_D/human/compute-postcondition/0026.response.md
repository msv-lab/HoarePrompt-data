Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `x`, which is expected to be a list containing two integers: the first representing the number of operations (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and the second representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5). The function attempts to return a value from a list `b` based on the contents of `x` and a list `a`. If the condition `f == 0` is true, the function will attempt to return the value at index `x` in the list `b`, which will result in an error if `b` is not defined. Otherwise, the function iterates over a range from `f - 1` down to 0, modifying `x` based on the values in `a`. If a specific condition is met during the iteration, the function returns a value from `b`. If the loop completes without returning, the function ends without returning a value, leaving `x` in a potentially modified state and `f` unchanged. **
