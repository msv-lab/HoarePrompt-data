Output State: **`i` is the second element in `a`, `x` is `(x - 1) % i + 1`, `a` must have at least two elements, `x` is not in `b`.** 

Explanation:
- `i` is updated to the second element in the list `a`.
- `x` is recalculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1` using the new value of `i`.
- The conditions that `a` must have at least two elements and `x` is not in `b` remain unchanged.
