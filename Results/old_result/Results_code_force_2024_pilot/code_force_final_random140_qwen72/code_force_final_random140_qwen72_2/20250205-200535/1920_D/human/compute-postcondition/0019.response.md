Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` representing the k-th element to be queried from the array `a`. Depending on the conditions, the function returns: Case_1: The value of the element at index `x` in the set `b` if `x` is an element of `b`. Case_2: The element from list `b` at the index calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the first element in list `a` and `x` is an element in list `b`. Case_3: The value of `b[x]`, where `x` is calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1`, and `i` is the second element in list `a`, if `x` is not in `b`. Case_4: Raises an `IndexError` if `x` is not in `b` and the calculated index is out of bounds.**
