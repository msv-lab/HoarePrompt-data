#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array a, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array a after all operations have been performed.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value of the element at index `x` in the set `b`. Since `x` is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array `a`, and `x` is also an element of the set `b`, the program returns the value associated with the element `x` in the set `b`.
    #State: x is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array a, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array a after all operations have been performed, and x is not in b
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is the final result of the expression `((x - 1) % i + 1)` after iterating through all elements in `a`, and `x` is not in `b`. The loop has iterated through all elements in `a`, and no value was returned because `x` was never found in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input and operates on two external data structures, a list `a` and a set `b`. It returns a value from the set `b` based on the following logic: If `x` is directly in `b`, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`. If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through each element `i` in the list `a`, updating `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`. During this iteration, if the updated `x` becomes an element of `b`, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`. If no such `x` is found in `b` after iterating through all elements in `a`, the function does not return any value, effectively returning `None`.
