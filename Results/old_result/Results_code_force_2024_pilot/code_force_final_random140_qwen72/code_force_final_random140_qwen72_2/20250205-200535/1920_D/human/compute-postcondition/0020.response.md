Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input and operates on two external data structures, a list `a` and a set `b`. It returns a value from the set `b` based on the following logic: If `x` is directly in `b`, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`. If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through each element `i` in the list `a`, updating `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`. During this iteration, if the updated `x` becomes an element of `b`, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`. If no such `x` is found in `b` after iterating through all elements in `a`, the function does not return any value, effectively returning `None`. **
