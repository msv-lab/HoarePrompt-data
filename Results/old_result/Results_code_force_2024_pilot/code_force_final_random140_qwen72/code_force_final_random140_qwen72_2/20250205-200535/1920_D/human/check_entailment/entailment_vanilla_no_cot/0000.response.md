Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Variable Naming and Scope**: The variable `r` used in the `map` function inside the print statement is not defined. It seems like it should be `func_1`, but it's not referenced correctly.

2. **Logic for Handling Operations**: The logic for handling the operations (type 1 and type 2) is flawed. Specifically, the way the array `a` is manipulated and the dictionary `b` is updated does not correctly reflect the operations described in the problem. For example, the condition `if d & 1:` checks if `d` is odd, but the problem specifies that `b` can only be 1 or 2, so this check is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Handling Large Arrays**: The program attempts to handle large arrays by using a list `a` and a dictionary `b`, but the logic for updating these structures is incorrect. The program does not correctly simulate the appending of elements or the replication of the array as described in the problem.

4. **Query Handling**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the queries, but it is not integrated correctly into the main loop. The way it processes the queries and the use of modulo operations do not align with the expected behavior for finding the k-th element in the array.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be rewritten to correctly simulate the operations and handle the queries as specified in the problem description.
