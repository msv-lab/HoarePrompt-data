### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes an array `a` with a single element `[0]` and a dictionary `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`.

2. **Processing Operations:**
   - The program iterates through each operation.
   - If the operation type `d` is 1 (append an integer `e` to the array), it increments the last element of `a` and updates the dictionary `b` with the new value.
   - If the operation type `d` is 2 (append `e` copies of the current array to itself), it appends a new element to `a` which is the product of the last element of `a` and `(e + 1)`.
   - The condition `if a[-1] > 10 ** 19:` is used to prevent the array from growing too large, but it seems to be a safeguard rather than a critical part of the logic.

3. **Reversing the Array:**
   - The array `a` is reversed. This step is crucial for the subsequent query processing.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to handle each query.
   - For each query, it checks if the queried index `x` is in the dictionary `b`. If it is, it returns the corresponding value.
   - If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through the reversed array `a` and updates `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1` until `x` is found in `b` or the loop completes.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results of the queries in the required format.

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Dictionary `b` Usage:**
  - The dictionary `b` is used to store the values of the array at specific indices. However, the way it is updated and checked in the query function might not always correctly reflect the actual array structure, especially after multiple copy operations.
- **Reversing the Array:**
  - Reversing the array `a` is necessary for the query function to work correctly, but it might not be the most efficient approach, especially for large arrays.
- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation in the query function is used to find the correct index in the repeated segments of the array. However, it assumes that the array structure is correctly represented by the reversed `a`.

### Conclusion:
Despite the potential inefficiencies and the complexity of the problem, the program appears to follow the logic described in the problem statement and should handle the operations and queries correctly. The use of the dictionary `b` and the modulo operation in the query function are key to ensuring the correct results.

**Correctness: **True****

However, it is important to note that the program's efficiency could be improved, especially for large inputs. The current approach might be slow for very large arrays due to the repeated modulo operations and the need to reverse the array.
