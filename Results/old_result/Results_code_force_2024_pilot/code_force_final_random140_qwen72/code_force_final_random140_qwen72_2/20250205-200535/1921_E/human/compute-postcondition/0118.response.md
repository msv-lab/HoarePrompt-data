Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) and determines the winner ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') based on specific conditions involving these integers. The function then prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has printed a result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') for each one, and the final state includes the number of test cases processed and the results printed. **
