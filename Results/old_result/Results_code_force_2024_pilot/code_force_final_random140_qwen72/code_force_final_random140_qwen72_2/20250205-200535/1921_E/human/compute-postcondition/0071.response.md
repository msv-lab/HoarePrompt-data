Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `x1 + (1 - 1)` if `y2 >= 1` or `x1 + (r[1] - 1)` if `y2 < 1`, `y1` is equal to `1`, `x2` is now equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `r[5] - a` if `y2 < 1` or `r[5]` if `y2 >= 1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference `(x2 - x1)` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is equal to `1 - 1` if `y2 >= 1` or `r[1] - 1` if `y2 < 1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, and `x2 <= n`. Additionally, the absolute value of `1 - 1` is less than the absolute value of `1 - m`. `c` is equal to `y2 - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `c = y2 - 1` assigns the value of `y2 - 1` to the variable `c`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
