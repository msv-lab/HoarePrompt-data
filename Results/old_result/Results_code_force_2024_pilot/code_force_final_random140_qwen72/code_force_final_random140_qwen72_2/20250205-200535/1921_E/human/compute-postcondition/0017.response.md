Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y2` > `y1`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`. Otherwise, `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`.***
