Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical flaw in handling certain edge cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles scenarios where the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips are such that Bob can win in the first move. 

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3 2 2 1 2
```
In this case:
- Alice starts at (2, 2).
- Bob starts at (1, 2).

According to the rules, Bob can move up to (2, 2) on his first move, which would result in Bob winning immediately. However, the provided program does not correctly handle this scenario and may output "Draw" instead of "Bob".

This indicates that the program does not correctly account for all possible initial positions and their immediate outcomes, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
