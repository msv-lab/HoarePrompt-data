The code `t = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns this value to `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]`.
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1` and `a` is equal to `y2 - 1`.
- If `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1` and `a` is equal to `m - y2`.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.

After executing the code `t = abs(y2 - y1)`, the value of `t` is updated to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1` and `a` is equal to `y2 - 1`, if `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1` and `a` is equal to `m - y2`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.**
