To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `answers`.

Given:
- `answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration.
- `i` is `test_cases - 1`.
- `test_cases` is the number of test cases input by the user.
- The length of `answers` is equal to `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute, `answers` must contain at least one element. Since `answers` is a list and its length is equal to `test_cases`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `answers` is not empty and `j` is the first element of `answers`.

State: **`answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration, `answers` must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element of `answers`, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
