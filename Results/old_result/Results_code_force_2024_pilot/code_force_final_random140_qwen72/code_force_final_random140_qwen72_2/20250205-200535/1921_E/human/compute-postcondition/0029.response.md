The value of `x1` is incremented by `a`. To determine the new value of `x1`, we need to consider the conditions under which `a` is defined:

- If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is set to `r[3] - 1` and `a` is set to `y2 - 1`.
- If `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is set to `r[3] + 1` and `a` is set to `m - y2`.

Given these conditions, the new value of `x1` will be:

- If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`: `x1` becomes `r[2] + 1 + (y2 - 1)`.
- If `y1` is less than `y2`: `x1` becomes `r[2] + 1 + (m - y2)`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is updated to `r[2] + 1 + a` where `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2` and `m - y2` if `y1` is less than `y2`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`, if `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.**
