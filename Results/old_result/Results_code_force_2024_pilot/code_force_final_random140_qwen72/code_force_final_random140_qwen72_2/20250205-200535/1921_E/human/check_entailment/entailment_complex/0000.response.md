Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` is called in a loop for each test case. However, the function itself is not defined with parameters to handle the test cases. Instead, it reads input directly within the function. This is a deviation from the expected function signature but does not necessarily make the program incorrect if it works as intended.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function correctly checks if `x2 <= x1`, which means Bob's chip is already at or above Alice's chip. In this case, the game is a draw because Alice cannot move down to Bob's position.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd. If `y1 == y2`, Alice can win by moving directly to Bob's position.

3. **Handling Odd Differences**:
   - The function correctly simulates Alice's and Bob's moves when the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd. It updates the positions and checks if Alice can win by moving to Bob's position or if the game ends in a draw due to boundary conditions.

4. **Handling Even Differences**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even. It checks if `y1 == y2`, in which case Bob can win by moving directly to Alice's position.
   - It also simulates the moves and checks if Bob can win or if the game ends in a draw.

5. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The function correctly checks if the moves would result in the chips going out of bounds, which would end the game in a draw.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct outcomes ("Alice", "Bob", or "Draw") based on the game logic.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the game logic and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
