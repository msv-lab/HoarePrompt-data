Let's break down the initial state and determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.
   - `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
   - `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is updated to `x1 + (y1 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1` or `x1 + (r[1] - r[3])` if `y2 < y1`.
   - `y1` is updated to `r[3]`.
   - `x2` is updated to `r[4] - a`.
   - `y2` is updated to `r[5]`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - The difference `(x2 - x1)` is even.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[1] - r[3]` if `y2 < y1`.
   - `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
   - Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - The condition `x2 > x1` is explicitly stated.
   - The condition `(x2 - x1)` is even is also explicitly stated.
   - The condition `y1 != y2` is explicitly stated.
   - The additional conditions state that either `x2 <= x1`, `x1 < 1`, or `x2 > n` must be true.

3. **Evaluating the Additional Conditions:**
   - Since `x2 > x1` is true, the condition `x2 <= x1` cannot be true.
   - Therefore, one of the other two conditions must be true: `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the conditions, the print statement will execute because one of the additional conditions (`x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`) must be true.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **draw**
