The code snippet `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `r`.

Given the initial state:
- The function `game_outcome` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `r` will contain a list of integers read from the input. The other variables (`t` and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `game_outcome` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers. `r` is a list of integers read from the input.**
