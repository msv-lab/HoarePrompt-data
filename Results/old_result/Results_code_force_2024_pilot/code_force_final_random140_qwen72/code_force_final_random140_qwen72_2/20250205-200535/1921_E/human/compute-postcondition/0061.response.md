The code snippet `t = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns this value to `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2]`.
- `y1` is equal to `r[3]`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]`.
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference `(x2 - x1)` is even.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is equal to `y1 - 1`.
- Otherwise, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is equal to `r[1] - r[3]`.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `t` is now the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference `(x2 - x1)` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is equal to `y1 - 1`, otherwise, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is equal to `r[1] - r[3]`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.**
