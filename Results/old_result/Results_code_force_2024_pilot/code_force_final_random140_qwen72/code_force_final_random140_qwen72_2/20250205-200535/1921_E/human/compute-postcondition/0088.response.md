Postcondition: ***`answers` is a list, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is greater than 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.***
