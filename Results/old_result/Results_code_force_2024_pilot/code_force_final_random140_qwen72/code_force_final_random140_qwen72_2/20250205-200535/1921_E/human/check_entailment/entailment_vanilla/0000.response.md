### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `tt` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads six integers from the input: `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.
   - These represent the dimensions of the board (`n` rows, `m` columns) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`).

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - If `x2 <= x1`, it means Bob is already at or above Alice, so the game is a draw because neither can win.
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd, which affects the possible outcomes.

4. **Odd Vertical Distance:**
   - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can win by moving directly to Bob's position.
   - If `y2 > y1`, Alice moves diagonally down-right; otherwise, she moves diagonally down-left.
   - After these moves, if `y1 == y2`, Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the remaining vertical and horizontal distances and checks if Alice can force a win.

5. **Even Vertical Distance:**
   - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can win by moving directly to Alice's position.
   - Similar to the odd case, the program calculates the remaining distances and checks if Bob can force a win.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if the new positions of the chips are within the board boundaries.
   - If any condition for a win is met, the program prints the winner; otherwise, it prints "draw".

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly. It follows the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
