The value of `y1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `y2` was already greater than `y1`, after incrementing `y1` by 1, `y2` is still greater than the new value of `y1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `r` is a list of integers, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y2` is greater than `y1`.**
