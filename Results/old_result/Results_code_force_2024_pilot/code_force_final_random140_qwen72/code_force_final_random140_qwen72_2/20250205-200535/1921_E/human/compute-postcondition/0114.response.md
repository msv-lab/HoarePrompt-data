The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `answers`. If `answers` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `answers` must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element of `answers`, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` will be the third element of `answers`.

State: **`answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration, `answers` must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element of `answers`, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
