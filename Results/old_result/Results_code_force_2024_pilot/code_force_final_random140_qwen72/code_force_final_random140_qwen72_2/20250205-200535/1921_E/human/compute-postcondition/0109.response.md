Output State: **`answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` is the number of test cases input by the user. The length of `answers` is equal to `test_cases`.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have reached the value `test_cases - 1`, as the loop runs from `0` to `test_cases - 1`.
- The list `answers` will contain one result ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each test case, based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop.
- The length of `answers` will be equal to the number of test cases, `test_cases`.
- The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged, as it is defined before the loop and is not modified within the loop.
