Postcondition: ***`answers` is a list, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is greater than 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` contains one additional element `'Draw'` at the end. Otherwise, `answers` contains the original elements plus `'Alice'`.***
