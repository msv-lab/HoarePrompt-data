### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it calls a function `func_1()` which is supposed to handle the logic for each test case.
   - However, the function `func_1()` is not defined with parameters to match the problem description. It should be defined as `def game_outcome(t, test_cases):` where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing the test case data.

2. **Logic within `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the input for each test case and assigns the values to variables `n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2`.
   - It then checks various conditions to determine the outcome of the game:
     - If `x2 <= x1`, it prints "draw" and returns.
     - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0` (i.e., the difference is odd), it further checks:
       - If `y1 == y2`, it prints "Alice" and returns.
       - Otherwise, it updates `x1` and `y1` and checks again if `y1 == y2`.
       - If not, it calculates `a`, `b`, `t`, and updates `x1` and `x2` accordingly.
       - It then checks additional conditions to determine if Alice wins or if it's a draw.
     - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` (i.e., the difference is even), it follows a similar but slightly different set of checks to determine the outcome.

3. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `x2 <= x1` or when the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even or odd.
   - It also ensures that the moves do not go beyond the board boundaries by checking `1 <= y1 <= m` and `1 <= x1 <= n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the conditions checked, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required and correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the given rules.

**Correctness: **True**
