The value of `x1` is incremented by 1. Since `x1` was initially equal to `r[2]`, after the increment, `x1` is now equal to `r[2] + 1`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `r` is a list of integers, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y2` is greater than `y1`.**
