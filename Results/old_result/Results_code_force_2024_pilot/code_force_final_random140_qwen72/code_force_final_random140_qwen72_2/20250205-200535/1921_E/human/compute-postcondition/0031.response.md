Postcondition: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is updated to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is now equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`, if `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`. Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.**
