You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, where `1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9`, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a ≠ x_b` or `y_a ≠ y_b`. The function should process an unspecified number of test cases, but the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed `10^6`.
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for i in range(test_cases):
        clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
            answers.append('Draw')
        elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4
            ] % 2 != 0:
            if clues[3] == clues[5]:
                answers.append('Bob')
            elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
                if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Bob')
            elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
                if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Alice')
        elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
            answers.append('Alice')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Alice')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Alice')
        
    #State: `answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` is the number of test cases input by the user. The length of `answers` is equal to `test_cases`.
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
        
    #State: `answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration, `answers` has been fully iterated over, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` remains the same as it was initially.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The function ensures that `1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9`, and either `x_a ≠ x_b` or `y_a ≠ y_b`. It processes an unspecified number of test cases, with the constraint that the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed `10^6`. The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.
