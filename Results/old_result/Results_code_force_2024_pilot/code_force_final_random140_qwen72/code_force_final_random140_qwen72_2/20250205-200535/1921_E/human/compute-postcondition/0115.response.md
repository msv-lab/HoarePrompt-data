Based on the initial state:

- `answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration.
- `answers` must have at least 3 elements.
- `j` is the third element of `answers`.
- `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

```python
print(j)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `answers`**: This list contains at least 3 elements, each of which is one of the strings 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
2. **Variable `j`**: According to the precondition, `j` is the third element of the `answers` list. Since Python uses zero-based indexing, `j` corresponds to `answers[2]`.
3. **Value of `j`**: The value of `j` will be the string located at the third position in the `answers` list. This string can be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the third element of the `answers` list, which is one of the strings 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

Output: **j (where j is the third element of the answers list, and can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
