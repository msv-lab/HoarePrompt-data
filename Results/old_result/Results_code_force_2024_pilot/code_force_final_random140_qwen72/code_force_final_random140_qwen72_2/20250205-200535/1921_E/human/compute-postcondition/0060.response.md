Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference `(x2 - x1)` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is equal to `y1 - 1`. Otherwise, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is equal to `r[1] - r[3]`. `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.**
