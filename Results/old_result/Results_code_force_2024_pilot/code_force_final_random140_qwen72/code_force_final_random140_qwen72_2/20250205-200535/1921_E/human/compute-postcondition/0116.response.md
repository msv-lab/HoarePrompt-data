Output State: **`answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration, `answers` has been fully iterated over, `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` remains the same as it was initially.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `answers` has been completely traversed, printing each of its elements. The variable `i` remains as `test_cases - 1`, and the value of `test_cases` does not change from its initial value.
