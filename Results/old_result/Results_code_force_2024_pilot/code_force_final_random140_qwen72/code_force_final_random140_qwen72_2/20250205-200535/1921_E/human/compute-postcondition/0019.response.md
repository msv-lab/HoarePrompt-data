Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]`.
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y2` > `y1`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`.
- Otherwise, `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`.
- Additionally, `y1` is equal to `y2`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the final state of the variables:

1. `x1 = r[2] + 1`
2. `x2 = r[4]`
3. `y2 = r[5]`
4. `y1` is set based on the condition:
   - If `y2 > y1`, then `y1 = r[3] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `y1 = r[3] - 1`.
5. The additional condition states that `y1` is equal to `y2`.

This means that after setting `y1` based on the condition, `y1` must be equal to `y2`. This implies that the condition `y1 != y2` is not satisfied, which contradicts the earlier condition. However, since the problem states that `y1` is equal to `y2`, we must assume that the condition `y1 != y2` was initially true but is now resolved to `y1 == y2`.

Given this, the `print` statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
