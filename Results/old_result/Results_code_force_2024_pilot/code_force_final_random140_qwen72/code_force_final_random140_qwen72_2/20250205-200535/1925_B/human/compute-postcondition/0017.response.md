Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the values [1, 2].**

The code appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contained only the value 1. After the execution of the code, `l` now contains the values [1, 2]. All other variables remain unchanged.
