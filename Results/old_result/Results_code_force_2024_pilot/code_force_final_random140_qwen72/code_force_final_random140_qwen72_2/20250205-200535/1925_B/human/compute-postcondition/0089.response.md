The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. Therefore, `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3, `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` must be greater than 3. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `l` is `[ans, x // 2]` if `i > k`, otherwise `l` is `[ans, 2, x // 2]`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains 1 and `l` remains `[1, 1]`.**
