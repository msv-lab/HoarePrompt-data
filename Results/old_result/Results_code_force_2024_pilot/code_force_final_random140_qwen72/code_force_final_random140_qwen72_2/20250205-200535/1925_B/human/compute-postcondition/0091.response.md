Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing two elements `[ans, 3]`.** 

The value of `i` (which is 3) is appended to the list `l`, which initially contained a single element `ans`. Therefore, `l` now contains two elements: `ans` and `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
