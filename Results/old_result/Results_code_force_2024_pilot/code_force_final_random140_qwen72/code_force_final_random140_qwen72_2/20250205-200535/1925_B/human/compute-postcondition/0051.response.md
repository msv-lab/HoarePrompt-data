Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, and `l` is a list containing `[1]`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is updated to contain `[1, 2]`.***
