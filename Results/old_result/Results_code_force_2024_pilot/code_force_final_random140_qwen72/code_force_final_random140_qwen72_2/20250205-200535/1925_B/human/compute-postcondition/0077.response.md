The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the result of the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is a non-negative integer
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`)
- `ans` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `x % i` is 0
- `l` is a list containing `[1]`
- If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is updated to contain `[1, 1]`
- The condition `(x // i <= k)` is true, meaning that the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`

After executing the code:
- The value of `x // i` is calculated and appended to the list `l`.
- Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is simply `x`.

Therefore, the list `l` now contains `[1, 1, x]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[1, 1, x]`, and the condition `(x // i <= k)` is true.**
