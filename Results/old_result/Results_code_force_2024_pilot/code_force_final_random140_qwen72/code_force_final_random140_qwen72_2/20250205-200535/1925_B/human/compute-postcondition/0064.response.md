Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- For each iteration, if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), the loop checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`.
- The variable `ans` is updated to the maximum value among the current `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if they are valid divisors and less than or equal to `k`.
- After the loop completes, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- The variable `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` after the loop finishes, as it increments with each iteration and the loop stops when `i` reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
