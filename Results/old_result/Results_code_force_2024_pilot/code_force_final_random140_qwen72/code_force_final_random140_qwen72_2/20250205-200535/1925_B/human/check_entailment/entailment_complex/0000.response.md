### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties should be maximized.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It calculates `k` as the integer division of `x` by `n` (`k = x // n`).
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It then iterates over possible divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x` plus 1.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` divides `x` without a remainder.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it adds `i` and `x // i` to a list `l` if they are less than or equal to `k`.
   - It updates `ans` to the maximum value in the list `l`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the divisors of `x` and checks if they are less than or equal to `k`.
   - By considering both `i` and `x // i`, it ensures that all possible divisors are considered.
   - The use of the square root of `x` optimizes the search for divisors, ensuring the algorithm runs efficiently even for large values of `x`.
   - The final value of `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, which is the correct answer for the problem.
