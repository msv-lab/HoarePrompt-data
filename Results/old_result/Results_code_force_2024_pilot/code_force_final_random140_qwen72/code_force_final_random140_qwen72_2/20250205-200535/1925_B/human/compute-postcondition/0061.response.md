Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing `[ans]` if `i > k`, or `[ans, 3]` if `i <= k`, and `ans` is 1 if `x % 2 != 0` or `x // 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // 2`. If `x // 3 <= k`, `l` now contains the value `x // 3` appended to it.***
