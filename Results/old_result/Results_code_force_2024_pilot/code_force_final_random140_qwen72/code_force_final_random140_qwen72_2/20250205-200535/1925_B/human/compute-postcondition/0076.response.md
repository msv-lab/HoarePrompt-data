Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, and `l` is a list containing `[1]`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is updated to contain `[1, 1]`. Additionally, the condition `(x // i <= k)` is true, meaning that the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
