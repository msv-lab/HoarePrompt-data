The value of `ans` is set to 1. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1.**
