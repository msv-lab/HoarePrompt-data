The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, which defines the upper limit of the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than this upper limit.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The upper limit `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` remains unchanged because it is determined by the value of `x`, which does not change between iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 2.**
