Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`. The key insight is that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must also be a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the maximum possible GCD is the largest divisor of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems.

The program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
3. It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the maximum possible difficulty for each sub-problem if they were evenly distributed.
4. It initializes `ans` to 1, which will store the maximum GCD found.
5. It iterates over potential divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x` plus 2.
   - If `i` is a divisor of `x`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`.
   - It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the valid divisors.
6. It prints the final `ans` for each test case.

The logic is sound because:
- The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.
- The maximum GCD should be the largest divisor of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems.
- By checking divisors up to the square root of `x`, the program efficiently finds the largest valid divisor.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly identifies the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n` and prints it for each test case. This matches the problem's requirements.
