Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
- `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`).
- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `k`**:
   - `k` is calculated as the integer division of `x` by `n`, i.e., `k = x // n`.
   - This means `k` is the largest integer such that \( k \times n \leq x \).

2. **Determine `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - To find `ans`, we need to identify the divisors of `x` and select the largest one that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `x = 20` and `n = 3`.
  - `k = x // n = 20 // 3 = 6`.
  - The divisors of `x = 20` are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.
  - The largest divisor of `20` that is less than or equal to `6` is `5`.
  - Therefore, `ans = 5`.

### General Case:
- For any given `x` and `n`, `k` is calculated as `x // n`.
- The largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` is determined by finding the divisors of `x` and selecting the largest one that meets the condition.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k, and k is the integer division of x by n)**
