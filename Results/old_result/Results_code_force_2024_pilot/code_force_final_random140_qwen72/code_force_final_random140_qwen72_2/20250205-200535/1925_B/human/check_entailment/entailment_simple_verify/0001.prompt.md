You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`.
   - The GCD of the set should be maximized.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The GCD of the set of numbers must divide `x` because the sum of the numbers is `x`.
   - Therefore, the GCD must be a divisor of `x`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the maximum possible GCD.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `i` can be a valid GCD by ensuring that `i` is less than or equal to `k = x // n`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `x // i` can be a valid GCD.
   - It keeps track of the maximum valid GCD found.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the maximum possible value for any sub-problem difficulty.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the smallest possible GCD.
   - It iterates over all potential divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are valid GCDs by comparing them to `k`.
   - It updates `ans` to the maximum valid GCD found.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly, as the GCD of a single number is the number itself.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is a prime number, where the only valid GCD is 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`. The approach is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
