To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` contains at least one value.
   - This means `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Check the Initial State:**
   - `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
   - For any positive integer `x`, `int(x ** 0.5)` will always be at least 1 because the square root of the smallest possible value of `x` (which is 1) is 1.
   - Therefore, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` will always be at least 2, ensuring that the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` contains at least one value.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` will always be at least 2 for any valid `x`, the loop will always execute at least once.
   - The initial state of `i` should be set to 1, as it is the starting point of the range.

### Final Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute as long as `x` is a positive integer within the given range.
- The initial state of `i` should be 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
