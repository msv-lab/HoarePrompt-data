Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). If `x // i <= k`, `l` is a list containing the values [1, 1, x // i]. Otherwise, `l` remains a list containing the value [1].***
