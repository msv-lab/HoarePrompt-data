Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the largest divisor of the new `x` that is less than or equal to the new `k`, `i` is the new `x`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the user input.
- The new value of `k` is calculated as the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n`.
- The value of `ans` is determined as the largest divisor of the new `x` that is less than or equal to the new `k`.
- The value of `i` is set to the new `x`.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
