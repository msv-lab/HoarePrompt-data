Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 2, `l` is a list. If `x % 2 == 0` and `x // 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains `[1, x // 2]` and `ans` is `x // 2`. If `x % 2 == 0` and `x // 2` is greater than `k`, then `l` contains `[1]` and `ans` is `1`. If `x % 2 != 0`, `l` remains an empty list and `ans` remains `1`.***
