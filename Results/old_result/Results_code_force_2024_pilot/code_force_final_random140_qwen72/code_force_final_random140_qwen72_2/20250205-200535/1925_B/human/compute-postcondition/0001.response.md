The code snippet `x, n = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `x` and the second part to `n`, both converted to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x
- The input is a positive integer greater than 0

After executing the code snippet, the new values of `x` and `n` are determined by the input. The values of `x` and `n` are now the integers provided by the user input, and they must satisfy the conditions 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 (as provided by the input), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x (as provided by the input)**.
