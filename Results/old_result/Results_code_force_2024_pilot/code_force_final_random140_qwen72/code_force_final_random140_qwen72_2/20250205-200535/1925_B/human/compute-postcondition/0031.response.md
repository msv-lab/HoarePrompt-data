Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`:** These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`:** The variable `ans` is updated during each iteration of the loop. The loop iterates over potential divisors of `x` from 1 up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For each divisor `i`, if `x % i == 0`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`. The maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` (if they are valid) is stored in `ans`. By the end of the loop, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- **`i`:** The loop variable `i` will have the value `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` after the loop completes, as it iterates from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Thus, the final state of `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
