The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be converted to an integer that is greater than 0. The variables `t`, `x`, and `n` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state must reflect that the input value is a positive integer, which means the input should be at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, and the input is a positive integer greater than 0**
