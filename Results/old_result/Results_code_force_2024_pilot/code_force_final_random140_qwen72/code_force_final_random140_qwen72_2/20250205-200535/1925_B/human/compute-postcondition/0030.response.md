Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3. If `x % i == 0` and `x // 3` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is the maximum value in `[x // 2, 3, x // 3]` and `l` is `[x // 2, 3, x // 3]`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // 3` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is 2 and `l` is `[2]`. If `x % i != 0`, then `ans` is `x // 2` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, and `l` is `[1, 2, x // 2]` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is `[1, 2]`.***
