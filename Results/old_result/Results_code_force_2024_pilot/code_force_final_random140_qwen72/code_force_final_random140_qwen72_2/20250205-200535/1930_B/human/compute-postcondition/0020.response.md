Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `i` is 0, and `p` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p = []` reassigns the variable `p` to an empty list, overriding its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `p` while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.
