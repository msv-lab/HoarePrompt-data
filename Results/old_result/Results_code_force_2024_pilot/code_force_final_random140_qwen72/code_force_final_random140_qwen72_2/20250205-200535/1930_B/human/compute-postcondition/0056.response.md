Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `a` (3 ≤ a ≤ 10^5). For each test case, the function generates and prints a permutation of integers from 1 to `a`. The permutation starts with all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (or `a - 1` if `a` is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a` (or `a - 1` if `a` is even). The function does not return any values; it only prints the permutations for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
