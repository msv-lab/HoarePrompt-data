To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(2, a + 1, 2)`.
   - The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 2 up to (but not including) `a + 1`, with a step of 2.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (2) must be less than or equal to the stopping value (`a + 1`).
   - This means that `2 <= a + 1` must be true.
   - Simplifying this inequality, we get `1 <= a`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `i` should be set to 2 at the start of the loop.
   - The variable `a` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The variable `t` and the list `p` are not involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (unchanged).
- `a` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `p` remains an empty list (unchanged).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `p` is an empty list**
