The code snippet `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `a` is equal to `t` and must be at least 1
- `i` is the last even number less than or equal to `t`
- `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including the last even number less than or equal to `t`

After executing the code snippet, the list `p` will now include the value of `i` as its last element. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` remains the same as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is equal to `t` and must be at least 1, `i` is the last even number less than or equal to `t`, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including the last even number less than or equal to `t`, followed by the value of `i`.**
