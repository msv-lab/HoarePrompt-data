Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 4, `a` is equal to `t` and must be at least 4, `p` is `[2, 4]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` was `[2]`, so after appending 4, `p` becomes `[2, 4]`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
