### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to generate a permutation `p` of length `n` such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (where \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)) satisfy both \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution constructs the permutation by first adding all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and then adding all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive).
   - This approach ensures that the permutation alternates between even and odd numbers.

3. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The problem guarantees that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - The solution handles the input correctly by reading the number of test cases and the value of `n` for each test case.

4. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - By alternating between even and odd numbers, the permutation avoids the condition where \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\) for any distinct indices `i` and `j`.
   - This is because:
     - Even numbers are only divisible by other even numbers.
     - Odd numbers are only divisible by other odd numbers.
     - Since the permutation alternates between even and odd, no two consecutive elements can both be even or both be odd.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution works for the smallest valid `n` (which is 3) and larger values up to \(10^5\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the permutation will be `[2, 1, 3]`, which is valid.
   - For larger `n`, the pattern continues to alternate, ensuring the validity of the permutation.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the permutation is constructed correctly by first adding all even numbers and then all odd numbers.
   - The final state of the list `p` is as described, ensuring that the permutation alternates between even and odd numbers.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly generates a valid permutation for the given problem constraints.
