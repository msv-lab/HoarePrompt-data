Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `a` (which should be `n` according to the problem statement).

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program constructs the permutation `p` by first adding all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive if `a` is even, or up to `a-1` if `a` is odd).
   - It then adds all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive if `a` is odd, or up to `a-1` if `a` is even).

3. **Validation of Permutation**:
   - The constructed permutation ensures that no two consecutive elements satisfy the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct indices `i` and `j`.
   - This is because the permutation alternates between even and odd numbers, which inherently avoids the divisibility condition for consecutive elements.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `t` is within the range `[1, 10^3]` and `a` (or `n`) is within the range `[3, 10^5]`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
