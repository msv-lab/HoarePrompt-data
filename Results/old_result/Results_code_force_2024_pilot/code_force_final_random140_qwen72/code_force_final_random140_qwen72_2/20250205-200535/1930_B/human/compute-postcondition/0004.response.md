Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 2, `a` is equal to `t` and must be at least 2, `p` is now `[2]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` was an empty list, so after appending `2`, `p` becomes `[2]`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
