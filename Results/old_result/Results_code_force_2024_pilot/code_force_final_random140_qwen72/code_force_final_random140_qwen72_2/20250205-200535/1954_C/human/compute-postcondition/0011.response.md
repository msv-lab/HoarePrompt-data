Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is now the first character of `a`, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal. We continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.**
