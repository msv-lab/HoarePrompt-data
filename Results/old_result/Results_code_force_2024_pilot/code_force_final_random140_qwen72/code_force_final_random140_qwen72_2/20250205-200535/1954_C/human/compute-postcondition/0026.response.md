Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the second character of `a`, `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the second character of `a`, `vt` remains 0 if the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, otherwise `vt` remains 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**
