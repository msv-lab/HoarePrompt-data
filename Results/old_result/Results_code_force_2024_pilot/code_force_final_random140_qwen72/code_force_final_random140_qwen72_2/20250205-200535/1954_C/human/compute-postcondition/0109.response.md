Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 0, `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is the first character of `a`, `vt` is 0, and the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop or skip the rest of the current iteration.**
