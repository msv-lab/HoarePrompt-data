The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `q` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `q`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), `kq1` and `kq2` are strings formed based on the rules applied in the loop, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters in `a` and `b` were different at any point during the loop.**
