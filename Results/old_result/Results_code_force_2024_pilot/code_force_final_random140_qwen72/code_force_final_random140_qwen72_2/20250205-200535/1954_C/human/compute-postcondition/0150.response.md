The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and they consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns the result of some operation involving these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` and `y` are strings representing integers within the range 1 to 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9.
