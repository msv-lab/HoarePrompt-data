To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to construct `kq1`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `q` is 1.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is another input string.
- `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), meaning `a` and `b` are of the same length.
- `kq1` is constructed based on the following rules:
  - If the corresponding characters from `a` and `b` match, the character from `a` is used.
  - If the characters do not match, the smaller of the two characters (as integers) is used.
  - The order of alternation is based on the value of `vt`.
- `kq2` is constructed similarly but uses the larger of the two characters if they do not match.
- `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch between the characters of `a` and `b`, otherwise it remains 0.

### Constructing `kq1`:
1. **Matching Characters**: If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the character from `a` is used.
2. **Mismatched Characters**: If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, the smaller of the two characters (as integers) is used.
3. **Order of Alternation**: The order of alternation is based on the value of `vt`. Since `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch, the alternation will occur if there is any mismatch.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `a = "abc"` and `b = "abd"`.
- The length `i` is 3.
- `kq1` will be constructed as follows:
  - For the first character: `a[0] == b[0]` (both are 'a'), so `kq1[0] = 'a'`.
  - For the second character: `a[1] == b[1]` (both are 'b'), so `kq1[1] = 'b'`.
  - For the third character: `a[2] != b[2]` ('c' and 'd'), so `kq1[2] = min('c', 'd') = 'c'`.

Thus, `kq1` would be `"abc"`.

### General Case:
- If `a` and `b` have no mismatches, `kq1` will be identical to `a`.
- If `a` and `b` have at least one mismatch, `kq1` will be a string where each character is either the same as in `a` or the smaller of the two characters from `a` and `b` at the same position.

### Final Output:
The `print(kq1)` statement will print the string `kq1` constructed according to the rules described above.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string where each character is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character from `b`, or the smaller of the two characters (as integers) if they do not match, with the order of alternation based on the value of `vt`)**
