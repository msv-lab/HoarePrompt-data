Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is the string representation of the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `a`, followed by the third character of `a`, and `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `a`, followed by the third character of `a`, `vt` is 0. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is updated to 1, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`, followed by the third character of `a`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, followed by the third character of `a`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
