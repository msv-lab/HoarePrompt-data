Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 0, the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
