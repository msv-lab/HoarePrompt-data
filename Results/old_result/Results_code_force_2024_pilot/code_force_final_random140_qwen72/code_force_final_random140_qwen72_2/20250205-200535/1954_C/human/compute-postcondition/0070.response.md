Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 0, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
