Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
