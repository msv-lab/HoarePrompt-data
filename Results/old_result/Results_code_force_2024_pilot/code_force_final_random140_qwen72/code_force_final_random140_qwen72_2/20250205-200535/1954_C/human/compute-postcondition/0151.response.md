Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, which represent integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function then constructs two new strings, `kq1` and `kq2`, by comparing the corresponding characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters are equal, both `kq1` and `kq2` are appended with that character. If the characters are not equal, the smaller character is appended to `kq1` and the larger character is appended to `kq2` initially, and then the roles are swapped for subsequent unequal characters. Finally, the function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
