Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x`, `vt` is not 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- `kq2` was initially an empty string and is now updated to the string representation of `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `vt`, `i`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
