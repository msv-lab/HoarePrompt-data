Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of these values. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains non-zero.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of these values. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains non-zero.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2. If the third characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is updated to its previous value plus the third character of `a`, and `kq2` is also updated to its previous value plus the third character of `a`. If the third characters of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of these values. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated to its previous value plus the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated to its previous value plus the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is updated to its previous value plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated to its previous value plus the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains non-zero.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
