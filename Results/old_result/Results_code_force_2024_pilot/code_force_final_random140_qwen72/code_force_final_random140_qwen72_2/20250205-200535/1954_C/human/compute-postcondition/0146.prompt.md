Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, then `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x` repeated twice, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y` repeated twice, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2. If the third characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both updated to their previous values plus the third character of `a`, and `vt` retains its previous value (either 0 or 1). If the third characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x` repeated twice, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y` repeated twice, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
