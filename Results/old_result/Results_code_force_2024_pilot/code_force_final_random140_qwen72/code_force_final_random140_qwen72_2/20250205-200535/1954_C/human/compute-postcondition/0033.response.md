Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` retain their previous values, `vt` retains its previous value. If `vt` == 0, `kq1` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `vt` retains its previous value.***
