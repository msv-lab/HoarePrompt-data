Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is the string representation of the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `a`, `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is updated to 1, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is the string representation of the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `a`, followed by the third character of `a`, and `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `a`, followed by the third character of `a`, `vt` is 0. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is updated to 1, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`, followed by the third character of `a`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, followed by the third character of `a`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
