Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last positive segment before encountering a negative integer that resets `c` to 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `i`, `t`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user through the `input()` function, split by spaces and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
