The code snippet updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. This means that `maxi` will now hold the highest value between its previous value and the current value of `c`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` minus the largest positive cumulative sum reset by any negative element in `l` that caused a reset, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.**
