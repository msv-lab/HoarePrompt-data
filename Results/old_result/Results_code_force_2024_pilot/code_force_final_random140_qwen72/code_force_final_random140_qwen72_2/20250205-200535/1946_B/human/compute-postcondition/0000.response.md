To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start from 0 by default.
2. **Result of `int(input())`:** This represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

We need to ensure that the input provided to the loop (which is `t`) is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
