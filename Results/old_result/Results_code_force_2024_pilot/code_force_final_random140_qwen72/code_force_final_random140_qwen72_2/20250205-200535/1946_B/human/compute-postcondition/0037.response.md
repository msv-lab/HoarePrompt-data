Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and `maxi` is 0. If `ele` is a negative integer and `c` (which is 0) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to the value of `ele`.***
