Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element of the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and 0, `c` is 0.** 

Explanation: The variable `c` is set to 0, which updates its value from the initial state where it was described as the maximum of 0 and an unknown value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
