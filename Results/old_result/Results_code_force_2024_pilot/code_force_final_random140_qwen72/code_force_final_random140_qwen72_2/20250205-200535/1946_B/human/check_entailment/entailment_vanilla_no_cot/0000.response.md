Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the operations. The approach used in the function `func()` attempts to find a maximum contiguous subarray sum (`maxi`) and then uses this value to compute the final result. However, this approach does not correctly account for the optimal strategy to maximize the sum after `k` operations.

### Issues with the Provided Solution:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - The code attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it does so in a way that may not capture the true maximum subarray sum. Specifically, it resets the sum (`c`) when encountering a negative number, which is not the correct way to find the maximum subarray sum.

2. **Incorrect Use of `maxi`:**
   - The variable `maxi` is intended to store the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but the logic for updating `maxi` and resetting `c` is flawed. It does not correctly handle cases where the maximum subarray sum might include negative numbers or where the maximum sum might be achieved by including multiple subarrays.

3. **Incorrect Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is incorrect. The idea seems to be to multiply the maximum subarray sum by `2^k` and then adjust it, but this does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for maximizing the sum after `k` operations.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you should consider the following steps:

1. **Find the Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum efficiently.

2. **Determine the Optimal Strategy:**
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, you can repeatedly add this sum to the array to maximize the total sum.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add the sum of the entire array `k` times.

3. **Calculate the Final Result:**
   - Use the formula to calculate the final sum after `k` operations, taking care to handle the modulo operation correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the maximum subarray sum
        max_sub_sum = max_subarray_sum(l)
        
        # Calculate the total sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(l)
        
        # Determine the final result
        if max_sub_sum > 0:
            result = (total_sum + (2**k - 1) * max_sub_sum) % 1000000007
        else:
            result = (total_sum * (k + 1)) % 1000000007
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected solution uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then applies the correct logic to determine the final result after `k` operations.
