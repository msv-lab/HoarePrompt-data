Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `maxi` is 0, `c` is now equal to `ele`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. Since `c` was not initialized before this operation, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After the operation, `c` is now equal to the value of `ele`, which is the second element in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
