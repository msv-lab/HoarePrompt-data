Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, and the loop will execute again if `i` (which is 1) is less than the value of `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and `maxi` is 0. If `ele` is a negative integer and `c` (which is 0) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to the value of `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, and `maxi` is 0. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is equal to `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, and `maxi` is 0. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
