Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c`, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, and the loop will execute again if `i` (which is 1) is less than the value of `int(input())`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are input integers, which remains true after this code execution.
- The values of `i`, `t`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.
- The condition for the loop to execute again (`i` is less than the value of `int(input())`) is still valid and unchanged.
