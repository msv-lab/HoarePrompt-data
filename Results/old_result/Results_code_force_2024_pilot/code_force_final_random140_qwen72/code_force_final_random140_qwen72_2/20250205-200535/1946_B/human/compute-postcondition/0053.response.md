The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last positive segment before encountering a negative integer that resets `c` to 0
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`

After executing the code snippet:
- `l` is updated to the list of integers provided by the user.

The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last positive segment before encountering a negative integer that resets `c` to 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.**
