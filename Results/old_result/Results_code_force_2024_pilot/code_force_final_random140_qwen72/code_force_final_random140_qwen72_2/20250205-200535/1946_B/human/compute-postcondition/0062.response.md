Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element of `l`, and `maxi` is 0. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to the first element of `l`, which is either non-negative or has an absolute value greater than `c`.***
