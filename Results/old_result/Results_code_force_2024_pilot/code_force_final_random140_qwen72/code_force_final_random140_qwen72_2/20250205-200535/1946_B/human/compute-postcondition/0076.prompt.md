Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c`, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last positive segment before encountering a negative integer that resets `c` to 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` minus the largest positive cumulative sum reset by any negative element in `l` that caused a reset, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
