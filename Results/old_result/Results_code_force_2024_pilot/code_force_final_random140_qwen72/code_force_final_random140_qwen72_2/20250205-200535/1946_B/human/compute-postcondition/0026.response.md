The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the upper limit of the loop. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables change.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- The loop will continue if `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` (now 1) must be less than the value of `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c`, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, and the loop will execute again if `i` (which is 1) is less than the value of `int(input())`.**
