The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. The value of `ele` is the third element of the list `l`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element of the list `l`, `maxi` is 0, `c` is the second element of the list `l` plus the third element of the list `l` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is 0 plus the third element of the list `l` if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
