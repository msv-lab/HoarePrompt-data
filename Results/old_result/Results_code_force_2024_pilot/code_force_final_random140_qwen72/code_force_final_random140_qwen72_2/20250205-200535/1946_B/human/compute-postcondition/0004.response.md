Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.**

The variable `maxi` is initialized to 0, while the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
