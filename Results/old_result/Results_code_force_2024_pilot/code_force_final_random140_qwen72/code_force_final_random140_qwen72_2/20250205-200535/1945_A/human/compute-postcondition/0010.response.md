The value of `q` is incremented by the value of `r`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `p`, and `line` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer from the split line, `q` is the sum of the second integer from the split line and the third integer from the split line, `r` is the third integer from the split line, and `line` is the next line in the file after the current one, and the file must have at least one more line.
