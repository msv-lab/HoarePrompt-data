The only object in the loop head is the variable `line`, which iterates over the lines of the file starting from the second line. The state adjustments should focus on what changes in the loop head for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
- `p` is the integer value from the second line of the input or file.
- `q` is now `q + r`.
- `r` is the integer value from the second line of the input or file.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `line` must be the next line in the file. Since the loop is iterating over all lines in the file starting from the second line, the next `line` will be the next line in the sequence.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the integer value from the second line of the input or file, `q` is now `q + r`, `r` is the integer value from the second line of the input or file, and `line` is the next line in the file after the current one.**
