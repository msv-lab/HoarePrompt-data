The only object in the loop head is the variable `line`, which is part of the list comprehension `[*open(0)][1:]`. This list comprehension reads all lines from the standard input (file descriptor 0) and skips the first line.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
- `p` is the first integer read from the next line in the file.
- `q` is the sum of the second and third integers read from the next line in the file.
- `r` is the third integer read from the next line in the file.
- `line` is the next line in the file after the current one.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line available in the file after the current `line`. Therefore, the state of `line` needs to be adjusted to the next line in the file.

Since the loop iterates over the lines starting from the second line, after the current iteration, `line` should be the next line in the file, and the file must have at least one more line for the loop to continue.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer read from the next line in the file, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers read from the next line in the file, `r` is the third integer read from the next line in the file, and `line` is the next line in the file after the current one, and the file must have at least one more line.**
