The code snippet `p, q, r = map(int, line.split())` reads the next line from the file, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `p`, `q`, and `r`.

Given the initial state:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9
- `p` is the first integer read from the next line in the file
- `q` is the sum of the second and third integers read from the next line in the file
- `r` is the third integer read from the next line in the file
- `line` is the next line in the file after the current one, and the file must have at least one more line.

After executing the code:
- `p` is now the first integer from the split line
- `q` is now the second integer from the split line
- `r` is now the third integer from the split line

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer from the split line, `q` is the second integer from the split line, `r` is the third integer from the split line, and `line` is the next line in the file after the current one, and the file must have at least one more line.**
