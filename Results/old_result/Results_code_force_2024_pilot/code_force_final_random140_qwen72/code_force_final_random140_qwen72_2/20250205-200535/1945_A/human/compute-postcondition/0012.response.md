Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer from the last line processed in the file, `q` is the sum of the second integer from the last line processed in the file and the third integer from the last line processed in the file, `r` is the third integer from the last line processed in the file, and the file has been fully read with no more lines remaining.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop. The variable `p` holds the first integer from the last line of the file that was processed. The variable `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the last line of the file that was processed. The variable `r` holds the third integer from the last line of the file that was processed. The file has been completely read, and there are no more lines left to process.
