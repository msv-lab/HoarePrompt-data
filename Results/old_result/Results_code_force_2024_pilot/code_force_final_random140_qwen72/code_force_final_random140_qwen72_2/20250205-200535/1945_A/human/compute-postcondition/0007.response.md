To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- `p` is the first integer read from the next line in the file.
- `q` is the sum of the second and third integers read from the next line in the file.
- `r` is the third integer read from the next line in the file.
- `line` is the next line in the file after the current one.

### Expression Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]
```

This is a ternary-like expression in Python, where the value to be printed depends on the condition `r < q % 3`.

1. **Calculate `q % 3`:**
   - `q` is the sum of the second and third integers read from the next line in the file.
   - `q % 3` is the remainder when `q` is divided by 3.

2. **Evaluate the condition `r < q % 3`:**
   - If `r` is less than `q % 3`, the expression evaluates to `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it evaluates to `p - q // 3`.

3. **Calculate `p - q // 3`:**
   - `p` is the first integer read from the next line in the file.
   - `q // 3` is the integer division of `q` by 3.
   - `p - q // 3` is the result of subtracting `q // 3` from `p`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output either `p - q // 3` or `-1` depending on the condition `r < q % 3`.

- If `r < q % 3`, the output will be `-1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `p - q // 3`.

Since the exact values of `p`, `q`, and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **(p - q // 3, -1) depending on whether r is less than q % 3 (where p is the first integer read from the next line in the file, q is the sum of the second and third integers read from the next line in the file, and r is the third integer read from the next line in the file)**
