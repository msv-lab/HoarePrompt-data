Functionality: ** The function reads lines from the standard input (stdin), excluding the first line, and processes each line to extract three integers `p`, `q`, and `r`. It then calculates a new value `q` by adding `r` to the original `q`. The function prints a result based on the condition `r < q % 3`. If `r` is less than `q % 3`, the function prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `p - q // 3`. After processing all lines, the function completes, and the file is fully read with no more lines remaining. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. **
