The value of `q` is incremented by the value of `r`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `p`) remain unchanged. Since `p`, `q`, and `r` are the integer values from the second line of the input or file, the new value of `q` is `q + r`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the integer value from the second line of the input or file, `q` is now `q + r`, and `r` is the integer value from the second line of the input or file.**
