Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. The output for the "NO" case should be in uppercase, but the function outputs 'No' in lowercase.
2. The logic for generating a different string is flawed. The function sorts the string and prints it, which does not guarantee that the output string will be different from the input string. For example, if the input string is already sorted, the output will be the same as the input.
3. The function does not handle the case where the string can be rearranged to a different string but is not necessarily sorted. It should ensure that the output string is different from the input string.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) <= 1 or len(set(string)) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Swap the first two characters to ensure the string is different
            if string[0] != string[1]:
                new_string = string[1] + string[0] + string[2:]
            else:
                # Find the first character that is different from the first one and swap
                for i in range(1, len(string)):
                    if string[i] != string[0]:
                        new_string = string[i] + string[1:i] + string[0] + string[i+1:]
                        break
            print('YES')
            print(new_string)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the output string is different from the input string by swapping characters when necessary. It also correctly handles the "NO" case with uppercase output.
