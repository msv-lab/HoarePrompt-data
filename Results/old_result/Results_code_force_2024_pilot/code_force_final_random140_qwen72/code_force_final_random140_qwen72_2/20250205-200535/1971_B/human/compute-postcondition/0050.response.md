Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string` + 1.
- `i` is the length of the new `string` + 1.
- `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.
- If `k` equals the length of `string`, all characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about various variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
