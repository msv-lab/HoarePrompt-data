Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`.
- `i` is the length of the new `string`.
- `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('Yes')
```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **Yes**
