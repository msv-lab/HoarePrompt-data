Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed and must have at least 2 characters, `m` is the first character of `string`. If `string[i]` (where `i` is 1) is equal to `m`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1.***
