Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string` + 1, `i` is the length of the new `string` + 1, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`. If `k` equals the length of `string`, all characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `string = input().strip()` updates the value of `string` to the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`, `i`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new `string` is now the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, which affects the subsequent conditions related to `i`, `m`, and `k`.
