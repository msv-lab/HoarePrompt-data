Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Program:
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        m = string[0]
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))





# Execution Summary:
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of up to 10 lowercase English letters. It then checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints 'No'. If not, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state includes `t` being an integer within the specified range, `s` being the last processed string, and all test cases having been fully processed.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
