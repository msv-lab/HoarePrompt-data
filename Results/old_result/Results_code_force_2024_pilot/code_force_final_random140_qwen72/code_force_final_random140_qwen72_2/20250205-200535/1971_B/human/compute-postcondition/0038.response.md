The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `string`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `string` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `string` must have at least 1 character. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `string` must still have at least 2 characters for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed and must have at least 2 characters, `m` is the first character of the new `string`. If the second character of `string` (at index 1) is equal to `m`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1.**
