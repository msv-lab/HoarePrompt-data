The code snippet `string = input().strip()` updates the value of `string` to the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is the length of the new `string`, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`. If `k` is equal to the length of the new `string`, all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.**
