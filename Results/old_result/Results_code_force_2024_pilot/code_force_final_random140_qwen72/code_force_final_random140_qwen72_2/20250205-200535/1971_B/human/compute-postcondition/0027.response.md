Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`.
- `i` is the length of the new `string`.
- `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.
- If `k` is equal to the length of the new `string`, all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
