The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `k` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `string[2]` is equal to `m` or not, the new value of `k` will be 2 or 3, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed and must have at least 3 characters, `m` is the first character of `string`. If `string[2]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 2.**
