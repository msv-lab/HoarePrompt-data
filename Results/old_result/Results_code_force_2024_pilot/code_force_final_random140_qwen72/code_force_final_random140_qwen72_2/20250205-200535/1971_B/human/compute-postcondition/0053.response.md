Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string` + 1, `i` is the length of the new `string` + 1, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is 0. If the length of `string` is 1, all characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, if `k` equals the length of `string`, all characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.**
