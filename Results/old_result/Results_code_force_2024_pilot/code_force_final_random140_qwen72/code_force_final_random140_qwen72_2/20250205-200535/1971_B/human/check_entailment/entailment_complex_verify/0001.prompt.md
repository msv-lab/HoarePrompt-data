You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        m = string[0]
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        
        m = string[0]
        
        k = 0
        
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` has been fully decremented to 0, `i` is the final index of the last iteration (which is `cnt_test_cases - 1`), `string` is the last input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of the last `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the last `string`. If `k` equals the length of the last `string`, all characters in the last `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of the last `string`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of up to 10 lowercase English letters. It then checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints 'No'. If not, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state includes `t` being an integer within the specified range, `s` being the last processed string, and all test cases having been fully processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Single Character String**: If the string has only one character, the function correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
3. **All Characters Identical**: The function checks if all characters in the string are the same by counting the occurrences of the first character. If all characters are the same, it prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.
4. **Rearrangement**: If the string has more than one distinct character, the function prints "Yes" and then outputs the sorted version of the string. Sorting the string ensures that the characters are rearranged, but it doesn't guarantee that the resulting string will be different from the original string.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Some Cases**: The current implementation always sorts the string, which may not produce a different string if the original string was already sorted. For example, if the input string is "abc", sorting it will still result in "abc", which is the same as the original string. This violates the requirement that the rearranged string must be different from the original string.

### Correct Implementation:
To ensure the rearranged string is different from the original string, we need to make a small change. One simple approach is to swap the first two characters if they are different, or swap the first character with any other character that is different.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(string)) == 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            # Swap the first two characters if they are different
            if string[0] != string[1]:
                rearranged = string[1] + string[0] + string[2:]
            else:
                # Find a different character to swap with the first character
                for i in range(1, len(string)):
                    if string[i] != string[0]:
                        rearranged = string[i] + string[1:i] + string[0] + string[i+1:]
                        break
            print(rearranged)
```

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
