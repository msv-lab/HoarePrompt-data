Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string` + 1, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed and must have at least three characters, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing from its initial value of 2 to 3.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`, `i`, `string`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
