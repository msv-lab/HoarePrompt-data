### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition exists, we should output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition exists, we should output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
     - This function is correct for checking palindromes.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function determines the minimum length of a substring that can be added to a given string `ch` to ensure that the resulting substring is not a palindrome.
     - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - Depending on the length of the string and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating how many characters to add to make the substring non-palindromic.
     - However, this function is not directly used in the main logic for partitioning the string.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic is missing from the provided code. We need to implement the main function that reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.
   - The main logic should:
     - Read the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, read the string `s`.
     - Check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
     - If possible, output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
     - If not possible, output "NO".

4. **Missing Main Logic:**
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are not sufficient to solve the problem as they do not handle the partitioning logic.
   - The main logic should use these functions to determine the partitioning and output the results.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions are correct for their intended purposes (checking palindromes and determining the minimum length to make a substring non-palindromic).
   - However, the main logic for partitioning the string and handling the test cases is missing, making the overall program incomplete and incorrect.
