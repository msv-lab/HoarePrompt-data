### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Function 1: `func_1(ch)`
- **Purpose**: To check if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
- **Logic**:
  - If the length of `ch` is even, it splits the string into two halves and checks if the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half.
  - If the length of `ch` is odd, it splits the string into two halves, including the middle character in the second half, and checks if the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half.
- **Issue**:
  - The function does not handle the middle character correctly for odd-length strings. For example, for the string "abcba", `func_1` would incorrectly return `False` because it compares "abc" with "cba" instead of "ab" with "ba".

#### Function 2: `func_2(ch)`
- **Purpose**: To determine the number of parts needed to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome.
- **Logic**:
  - It calculates the midpoint `b` of the string.
  - Depending on whether the length of `ch` is even or odd and whether the first half of `ch` is a palindrome, it returns a value (1, 2, 3, or 4).
- **Issue**:
  - The function does not actually partition the string or provide the required output format (i.e., "YES" or "NO" followed by the partition details).
  - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It returns a fixed number based on the length and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome, which does not guarantee that the resulting parts will not be palindromes.

#### Main Program Logic
- **Purpose**: To process multiple test cases and determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.
  - It performs several checks to determine if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
  - It uses `func_1` and `func_2` to make decisions.
  - It prints "YES" or "NO" based on the results and, if "YES", prints the partition details.
- **Issues**:
  - The palindrome check using `func_1` is incorrect, as explained above.
  - The partitioning logic is flawed and does not guarantee that the resulting parts will not be palindromes.
  - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the string consists of repeated characters.

### Example Case Analysis
- **Input**: "aba"
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program does not produce the correct output format and does not handle the palindrome check correctly. It might incorrectly return "YES" and an invalid partition.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly handle the palindrome check and partitioning logic, leading to incorrect outputs for various test cases.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
