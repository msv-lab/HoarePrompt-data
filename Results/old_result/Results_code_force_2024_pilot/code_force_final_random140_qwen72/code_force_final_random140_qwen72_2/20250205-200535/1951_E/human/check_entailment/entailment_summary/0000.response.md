### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to partition a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, we output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition is possible, we output "NO".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome. It does so by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half.
     - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`.
     - If the string is not a palindrome, it returns `False`.

   - **func_2**: This function determines the type of partition needed based on the length of the string and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - If the length of the string is even and the first half is a palindrome, it returns 3.
     - If the length of the string is even and the first half is not a palindrome, it returns 4.
     - If the length of the string is odd and the first half is a palindrome, it returns 1.
     - If the length of the string is odd and the first half is not a palindrome, it returns 2.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - It first checks if the entire string is a repeated character (e.g., "aaaa"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because no valid partition can be made.
   - It also checks if the string is a repeated pattern of two characters (e.g., "ababab"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False`.
   - If `T1` is still `True`, it calls `func_1` to check if the string itself is a palindrome. If it is, it sets `T1` to `False`.
   - If the string is longer than 3 characters and `T1` is still `True`, it calls `func_2` to determine the type of partition needed.
   - Based on the value returned by `func_2`, it attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as strings of length 1 or 2, which cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It also handles cases where the string is a repeated character or a repeated pattern of two characters, which cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program follows the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.
   - The logic for determining the type of partition and checking for palindromes is sound.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
