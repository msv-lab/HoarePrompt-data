Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. However, it incorrectly splits the string for odd-length strings. It should split the string into two halves and check if the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half. The current implementation has a logical error in handling the middle character for odd-length strings.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the number of parts needed to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome. However, its logic is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases. For example, it does not consider the possibility of splitting the string into more than one part when necessary.

3. **Overall Logic**: The program lacks the main function to process multiple test cases and generate the required output format. It does not handle the input and output as specified in the problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a solution that can partition the string into the minimum number of non-palindromic substrings and handle multiple test cases as described. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def partition_string(s):
    n = len(s)
    if not is_palindrome(s):
        return ["YES", 1, [s]]
    
    # Try to partition the string into two parts
    for i in range(1, n):
        left = s[:i]
        right = s[i:]
        if not is_palindrome(left) and not is_palindrome(right):
            return ["YES", 2, [left, right]]
    
    return ["NO"]

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        s = data[index]
        result = partition_string(s)
        results.append(result)
        index += 1
    
    for result in results:
        if result[0] == "NO":
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            print(result[1])
            print(' '.join(result[2]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version includes:
- A function `is_palindrome` to check if a string is a palindrome.
- A function `partition_string` to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
- A main function to read input, process each test case, and print the results in the required format.
