### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition exists, we should output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition exists, we should output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
     - This function is correct for checking palindromes.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function determines the minimum length of a substring that can be added to a given string `ch` to ensure that the resulting substring is not a palindrome.
     - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - Depending on the length of the string and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating how many characters to add to make the substring non-palindromic.
     - This function is not directly used in the main logic for partitioning the string, but it provides a way to determine the partitioning strategy.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic in the provided code attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It uses several conditions to check if the string can be partitioned:
     - If the string consists of the same character repeated, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
     - If the string is a palindrome and has more than 3 characters, it uses `func_2` to determine the partitioning strategy.
     - The code then attempts to partition the string based on the value returned by `func_2`.

4. **Evaluating the Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly identifies cases where the string cannot be partitioned (e.g., when all characters are the same).
   - For other cases, it uses `func_2` to determine the partitioning strategy, which is generally correct.
   - The code handles different lengths and structures of the string to ensure that the substrings are not palindromes.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are correct for their intended purposes.
   - The main logic in the provided code is also correct and handles the partitioning of the string appropriately.
   - The code correctly outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the partitioning logic and prints the partitioned substrings when possible.
