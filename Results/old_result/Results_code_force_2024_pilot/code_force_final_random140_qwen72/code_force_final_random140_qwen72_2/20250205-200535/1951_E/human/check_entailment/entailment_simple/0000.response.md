### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to partition a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, we output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If not, we output "NO".

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.
   - It then checks several conditions to determine if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Key Functions**:
   - **`func_1(ch)`**: This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It calculates the midpoint `x` and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - Returns `True` if `ch` is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.
   - **`func_2(ch)`**: This function determines a value `a` based on whether the first half of `ch` is a palindrome.
     - If the length of `ch` is even and the first half is a palindrome, it sets `a` to 3.
     - If the length of `ch` is even and the first half is not a palindrome, it sets `a` to 4.
     - If the length of `ch` is odd and the first half is a palindrome, it sets `a` to 1.
     - If the length of `ch` is odd and the first half is not a palindrome, it sets `a` to 2.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if the string `s` is a repeated character or a specific pattern.
   - If `s` is a repeated character or a specific pattern, it sets `T1` to `False`.
   - If `T1` is still `True`, it uses `func_1` to check if `s` is a palindrome.
   - Depending on the value of `a` returned by `func_2`, it attempts to partition `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If successful, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If not, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like single-character strings and strings of repeated characters correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program seems to correctly implement the logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The conditions and checks are logically sound and cover the required scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. It correctly handles the partitioning of strings into non-palindromic substrings and outputs the results as expected.
