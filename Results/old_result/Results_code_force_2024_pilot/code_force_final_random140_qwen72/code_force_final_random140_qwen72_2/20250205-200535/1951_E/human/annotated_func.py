#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `ch`, which is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It checks whether the first half of the string (or the first half plus the middle character if the length is odd) is a mirror image of the second half of the string. If the string is a palindrome in this sense, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the original string `ch` remains unchanged, and the function has no side effects on other parts of the program.

        #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1; `b` is equal to the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2; the length of `ch` is even. If `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, `a` is set to 3. Otherwise, `a` is set to 4.

        else :
            a = 2
        #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1 and odd. `b` is equal to the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 1. Otherwise, `a` is 2.
    #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1. `b` is equal to the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, `a` is set to 3. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, `a` is set to 4. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, `a` is set to 1. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, `a` is set to 2.

    #The program returns 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the conditions: if the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 3; if the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 4; if the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 1; if the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the length of `ch` and the result of `func_1(ch[:b])`, where `b` is half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 3; if the length is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 4; if the length is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 1; if the length is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 2. The function does not modify the input string `ch`.
