### Reasoning:

1. **Palindrome Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. This approach is generally correct for even-length strings, but it needs to handle the middle character correctly for odd-length strings.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect for odd-length strings. For example, for the string "abcba", `func_1` would incorrectly return `False` because it does not account for the middle character 'c'.

2. **Partitioning Logic (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to determine the number of parts needed to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome. However, it does not actually partition the string or provide the required output format (i.e., "YES" or "NO" followed by the partition details).
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It returns a fixed number based on the length and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome, which does not guarantee that the resulting parts will not be palindromes.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the program attempts to handle special cases where the string is composed of repeated characters or patterns. However, it does not correctly handle all edge cases.
   - The program uses a series of conditions to determine if a valid partition exists, but the conditions are not robust enough to cover all possible cases.

### Example Case Analysis:
- **Input**: "aba"
  - **Expected Output**:
    ```
    NO
    ```
  - **Actual Output**:
    - The program does not produce the correct output format and does not handle the palindrome check correctly. It might incorrectly return "YES" or fail to partition the string correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the palindrome check for odd-length strings and does not provide the required output format for valid partitions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
