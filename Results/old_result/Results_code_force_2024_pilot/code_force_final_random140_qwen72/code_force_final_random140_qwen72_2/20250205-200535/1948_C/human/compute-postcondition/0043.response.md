Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is currently executing within.
