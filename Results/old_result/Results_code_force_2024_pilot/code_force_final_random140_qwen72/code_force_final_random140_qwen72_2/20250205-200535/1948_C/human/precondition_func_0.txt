t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of 2 rows, and each cell contains an arrow represented by a character '<' or '>', indicating the direction of the arrow. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
