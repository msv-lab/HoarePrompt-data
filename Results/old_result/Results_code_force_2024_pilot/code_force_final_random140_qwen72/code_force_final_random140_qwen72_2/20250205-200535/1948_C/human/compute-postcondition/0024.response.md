Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `i` starts at 1.
- The condition is that either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`.

Given this precondition, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
