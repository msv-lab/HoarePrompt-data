Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and the loop has completed all iterations without breaking. The final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`. If the loop did not break, the program prints 'YES'.**

### Explanation:
- **`j`**: Remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the same input integer greater than 1.
- **`a` and `b`**: Remain the same input strings as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Starts at 1 and increments by 2 in each iteration. The loop runs for all odd numbers less than `n`. Therefore, the final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`.
- **Loop Completion**: If the loop completes all iterations without breaking (i.e., no condition `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is met), the program prints 'YES'. If any of these conditions are met, the loop breaks and 'NO' is printed. However, since we are considering the state after all iterations, it implies that the loop did not break, and thus 'YES' is printed.
