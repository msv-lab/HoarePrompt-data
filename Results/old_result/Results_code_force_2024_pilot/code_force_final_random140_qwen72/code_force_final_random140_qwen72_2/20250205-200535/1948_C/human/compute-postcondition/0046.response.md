The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because they are not referenced in the statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
