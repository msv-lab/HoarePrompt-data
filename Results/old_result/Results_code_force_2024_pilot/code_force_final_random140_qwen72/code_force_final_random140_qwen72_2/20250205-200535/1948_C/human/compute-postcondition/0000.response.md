The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer greater than 0. The other details about `t`, `n`, and the grid are not directly relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`j` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
