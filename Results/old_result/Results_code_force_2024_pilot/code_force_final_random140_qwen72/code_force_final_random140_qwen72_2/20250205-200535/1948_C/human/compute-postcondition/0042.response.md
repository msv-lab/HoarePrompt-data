Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2
- `a` is a new input string
- `b` is a new input string
- `i` is 1
- The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` must be true

Given this condition, the code snippet contains a `print('NO')` statement. This means that regardless of the specific values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n`, as long as the condition is met, the string `'NO'` will be printed.

Output: **NO**
