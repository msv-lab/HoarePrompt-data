Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `i` is 3. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as it was before the if statement.***
