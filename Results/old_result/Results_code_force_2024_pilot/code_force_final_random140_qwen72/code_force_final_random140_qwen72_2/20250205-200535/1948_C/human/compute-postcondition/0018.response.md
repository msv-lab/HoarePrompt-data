The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop iterates over the range defined by the input integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the bounds of the range `0` to `n-1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `j` remains within the valid range.

State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string**
