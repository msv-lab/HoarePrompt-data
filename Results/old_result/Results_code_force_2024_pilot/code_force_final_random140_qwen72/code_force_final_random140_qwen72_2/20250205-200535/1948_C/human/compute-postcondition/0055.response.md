Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of columns in a 2-row grid, where each cell contains an arrow ('<' or '>'), and the total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The function returns a result for each test case, which is not specified in the given information.**
