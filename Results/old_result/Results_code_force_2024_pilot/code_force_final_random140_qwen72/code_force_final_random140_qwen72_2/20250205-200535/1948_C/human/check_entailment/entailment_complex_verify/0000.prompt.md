You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of 2 rows, and each cell contains an arrow represented by a character '<' or '>', indicating the direction of the arrow. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `j` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking. The final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`. If the loop did not break, the program prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, it reads an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of columns in a 2-row grid. Each cell in the grid contains an arrow ('<' or '>'). The function checks if there exists any pair of adjacent cells in the same row or in the opposite row where both arrows point left ('<'). If such a pair is found, the function prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks the conditions for the robot's movement. Specifically, the condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is not sufficient to ensure that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).

Consider the following test case:
```
4
>><<
>>><
```
In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and the arrows are as follows:
- First row: `>><<`
- Second row: `>>><`

The robot's movements would be:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2) because the arrow at (1, 1) points right.
3. Move down to (2, 2) because the arrow at (1, 2) points down.
4. Move right to (2, 3) because the arrow at (2, 2) points right.
5. Move right to (2, 4) because the arrow at (2, 3) points right.

The robot successfully reaches (2, 4), so the output should be `YES`. However, the program incorrectly prints `NO` because it only checks specific conditions that do not cover all possible scenarios.

To fix this, the program needs a more comprehensive approach to simulate the robot's movements and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n).
