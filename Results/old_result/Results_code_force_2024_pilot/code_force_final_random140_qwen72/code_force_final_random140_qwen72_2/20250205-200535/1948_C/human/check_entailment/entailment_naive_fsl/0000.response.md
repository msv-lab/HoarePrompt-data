Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks the conditions for the robot's movement. Specifically, the condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is not sufficient to ensure that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).

Consider the following test case:
```
4
>><<
>>><
```
In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and the arrows are as follows:
- First row: `>><<`
- Second row: `>>><`

The robot's movements would be:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2) because the arrow at (1, 1) points right.
3. Move down to (2, 2) because the arrow at (1, 2) points down.
4. Move right to (2, 3) because the arrow at (2, 2) points right.
5. Move right to (2, 4) because the arrow at (2, 3) points right.

The robot successfully reaches (2, 4), so the output should be `YES`. However, the program incorrectly prints `NO` because it only checks specific conditions that do not cover all possible scenarios.

To fix this, the program needs a more comprehensive approach to simulate the robot's movements and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n).
