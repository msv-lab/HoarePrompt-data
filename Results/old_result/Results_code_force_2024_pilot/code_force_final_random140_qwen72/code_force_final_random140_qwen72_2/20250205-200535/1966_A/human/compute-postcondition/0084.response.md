Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input for each test case, `a` is a list of integers read from the input for each test case, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `ans` is set to `n` initially but is updated to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears at least `k` times. The final output for each test case is printed as `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, `n` and `k` are read from the input, and `a` is a list of integers also read from the input.
- A dictionary `h` is used to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
- The variable `ans` is initially set to `n`.
- If any integer in `a` appears at least `k` times, `ans` is updated to `k - 1`.
- After processing each test case, the value of `ans` is printed.
- The state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `h` changes with each iteration, but the overall structure and constraints remain consistent with the initial conditions.
