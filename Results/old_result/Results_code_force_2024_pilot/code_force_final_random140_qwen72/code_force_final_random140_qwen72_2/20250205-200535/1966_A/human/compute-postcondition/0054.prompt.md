Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first element of `a`. If `i` is already a key in the dictionary `h`, then the value associated with `i` in `h` is incremented by 1. If `h[i]` is at least `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `a`. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h[i]` is set to 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains either `n` or `k - 1` as determined by previous conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers containing at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary where `h[i]` is set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `h`, otherwise `h[i]` is increased by 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains either `n` or `k - 1` as determined by previous conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
