Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first element of the list `a`. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `h`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to include the key `i` with the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the second element of the list `a`. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `h` and `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`. If `i` is not a key in `h`, then `h` is updated to include the key `i` with the value 1. If `i` is a key in `h` but `h[i]` is less than `k`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that includes the key `i` with a value of at least 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains equal to `n` or `k - 1` depending on the conditions described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
