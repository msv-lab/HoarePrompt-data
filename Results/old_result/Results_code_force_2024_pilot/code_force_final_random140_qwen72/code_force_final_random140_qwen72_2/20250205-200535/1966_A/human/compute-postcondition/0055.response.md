To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
   - `ans` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ans` remains equal to `n`.

2. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The variable `ans` is determined based on the frequency of integers in the list `a`.
   - If any integer in `a` appears at least `k` times, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains equal to `n`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - To determine the value of `ans`, we need to check the dictionary `h` to see if any integer in `a` appears at least `k` times.
   - If such an integer exists, `ans` will be `k - 1`.
   - If no integer in `a` appears at least `k` times, `ans` will be `n`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be either `k - 1` or `n` depending on the frequency of integers in the list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is k - 1 if any integer in a appears at least k times, otherwise ans is n)**
