Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers read from user input, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency counts of each integer in `arrC`, `ans` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` is no longer greater than 0.
- The variables `n` and `k` will still be within their specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100) as they are re-initialized in each iteration of the loop.
- The list `c` will still contain integers within the specified range (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100), but its contents will be updated in each iteration based on user input.
- The list `arrC` will be a list of integers read from user input in each iteration.
- The dictionary `hashmap` will contain the frequency counts of each integer in `arrC` for each iteration.
- The variable `ans` will be set to `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise it will remain equal to `n`. This value is printed in each iteration and then `ans` is reset for the next iteration.
