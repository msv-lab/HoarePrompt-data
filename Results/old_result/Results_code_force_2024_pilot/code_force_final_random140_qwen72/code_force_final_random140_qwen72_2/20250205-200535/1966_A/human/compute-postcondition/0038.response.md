Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first element of `a`. If `i` is already a key in the dictionary `h`, then the value associated with `i` in `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added as a key in `h` with the value 1.***
