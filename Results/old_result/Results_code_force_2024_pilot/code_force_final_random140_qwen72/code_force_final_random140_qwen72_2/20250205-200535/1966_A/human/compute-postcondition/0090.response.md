Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from user input. Each test case consists of the number of cards (`n`), the number of cards exchanged in each operation (`k`), and a list of card numbers (`c`). For each test case, the function calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified exchange operations. If any card number appears `k` or more times, the function prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0. **
