Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `h` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in the list `a`) and its value is 1 if `i` was not already a key in `h`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `h`, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `i` is the first element in the list `a`.***
