Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that includes the key `i` with a value of at least 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains equal to `n` or `k - 1` depending on the conditions described.***
