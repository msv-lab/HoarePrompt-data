The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of cards.
  - `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, representing the number of cards exchanged in each operation.
  - `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers on the cards.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the operations performed on the cards. However, the specific output or return value is not clearly defined in the problem statement. Assuming the function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of cards), `k` (number of cards exchanged in each operation), and `c` (a list of card numbers). It processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the outcome of the operations performed on the cards for that test case.**
