Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first element of the list `a`. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `h`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is updated to include the key `i` with the value 1.***
