Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least two elements, `ans` is either `n` or `k - 1` depending on the conditions met during the iteration, `i` is the second element of `a`. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h[i]` is set to 1.***
