Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, representing the number of cards and the number of cards exchanged in each operation, respectively. Additionally, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n are integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers on the cards.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    h = {}
    ans = n
    for i in a:
        if i in h:
            h[i] += 1
        else:
            h[i] = 1
        if h[i] >= k:
            ams = k - 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `ans` is equal to `n` unless any value in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ams` is set to `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `ans` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ans` remains equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `ams` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears at least `k` times, otherwise `ams` remains undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
