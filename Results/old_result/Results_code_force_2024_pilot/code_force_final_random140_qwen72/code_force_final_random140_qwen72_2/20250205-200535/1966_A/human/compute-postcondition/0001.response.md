The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `k` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- The input for the loop must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t).

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer from the first part of the input.
- `k` is an integer from the second part of the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input.**
