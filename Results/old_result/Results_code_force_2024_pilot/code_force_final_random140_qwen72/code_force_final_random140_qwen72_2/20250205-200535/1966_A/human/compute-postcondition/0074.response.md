The code snippet provided sets the variable `ams` to `k - 1`. This operation does not depend on the current state of the program, except for the value of `k`. The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `h`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `h` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in the list `a`) and its value is 1 if `i` was not already a key in `h`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `h`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `ams` is `k - 1`.**
