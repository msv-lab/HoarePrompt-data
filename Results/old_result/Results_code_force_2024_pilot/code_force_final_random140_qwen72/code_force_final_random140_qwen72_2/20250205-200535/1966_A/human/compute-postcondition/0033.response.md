To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which will take on the values of elements in the list `a`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the list `a` contains at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `h` is an empty dictionary.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.
- The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `a` must be a list of integers that contains at least one element.
- `h` remains an empty dictionary.
- `ans` remains equal to `n`.
- `i` is set to the first element of `a`.

### Formatted Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first element of `a`**
