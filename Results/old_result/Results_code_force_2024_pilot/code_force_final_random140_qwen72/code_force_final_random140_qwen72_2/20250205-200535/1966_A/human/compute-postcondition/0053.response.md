Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers containing at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary where `h[i]` is set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `h`, otherwise `h[i]` is increased by 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains either `n` or `k - 1` as determined by previous conditions.***
