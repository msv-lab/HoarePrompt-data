Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary where `h[i]` is 1 (if `i` was not previously a key) or `h[i]` is increased by 1 (if `i` was already a key), `ams` is `k - 1`.**
