To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which will take on the values from the list `a`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the list `a` is not empty. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run at all.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is an integer from the first part of the input.
- `k` is an integer from the second part of the input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `h` is an empty dictionary.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, the list `a` must have at least one element.
- The variable `i` will be the first element of the list `a` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first element of the list `a`**
