The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `ans` is equal to `n` unless any value in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is set to `k - 1`.**
