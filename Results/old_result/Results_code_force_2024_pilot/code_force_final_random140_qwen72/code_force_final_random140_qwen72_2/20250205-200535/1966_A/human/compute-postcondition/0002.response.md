The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer from the first part of the input
- `k` is an integer from the second part of the input

After executing the code:
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
