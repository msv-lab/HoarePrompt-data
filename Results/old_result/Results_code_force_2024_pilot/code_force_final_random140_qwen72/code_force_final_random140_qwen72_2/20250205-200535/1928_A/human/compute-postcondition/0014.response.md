To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Conditions:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the condition is met.
2. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and:
   - If `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or
   - If `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then the condition is met.
3. If neither of these conditions is true, then:
   - Either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0, and
   - Either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The `print('NO')` statement is executed unconditionally in the given code snippet.
- This means that regardless of the values of `a` and `b`, the code will always print 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will always print the string 'NO' because it is not conditional on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
