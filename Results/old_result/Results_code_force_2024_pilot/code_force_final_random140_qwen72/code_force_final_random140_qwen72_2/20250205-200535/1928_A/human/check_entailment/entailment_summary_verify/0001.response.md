### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (considering rotations).

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then cutting the rectangle will always result in smaller rectangles that cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original.
   - If either dimension is even, we can cut the rectangle along the even dimension to get two smaller rectangles. These smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, we can always cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, or vice versa, we can cut the rectangle along the even dimension to get two smaller rectangles. These smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If \(a = b\) and both are even, we can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) or \(a \times b/2\) rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If \(a = b\) and both are odd, no new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints 'NO' because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - It checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other dimension is odd. If so, it prints 'NO' because the resulting smaller rectangles will be identical to the original when rearranged.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

5. **Verification Using Function Summary:**
   - The function summary confirms that the program correctly identifies the conditions where a new rectangle cannot be formed (both dimensions odd or one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other is odd).
   - The function also correctly identifies the conditions where a new rectangle can be formed (at least one dimension is even).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
