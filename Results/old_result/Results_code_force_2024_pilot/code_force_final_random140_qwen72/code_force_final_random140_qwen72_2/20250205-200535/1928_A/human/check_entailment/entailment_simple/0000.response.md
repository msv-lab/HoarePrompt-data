Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions of the rectangle (`a` and `b`).

2. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints "NO". This is correct because an odd-by-odd rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle when recombined. This is because any cut will result in at least one dimension being odd, and combining two such rectangles will not change the fact that at least one dimension remains odd.

3. **Special Case Check**: The second condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other dimension is odd. If this is true, it prints "NO". This is also correct because, in such a case, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles that can only form the original rectangle or its 90-degree rotation, which is considered the same.

4. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES". This is correct because if either `a` or `b` is even, or if neither of the special cases applies, Bob can always cut the rectangle in a way that allows forming a different rectangle.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs "NO" or "YES" in uppercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the specified conditions and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
