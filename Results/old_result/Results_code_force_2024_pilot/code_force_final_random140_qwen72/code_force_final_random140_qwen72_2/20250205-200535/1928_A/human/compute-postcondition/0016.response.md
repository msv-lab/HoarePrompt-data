To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Conditions:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the condition is met.
2. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and:
   - If `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or
   - If `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then the condition is met.
3. If neither of these conditions is true, then:
   - Either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0, and
   - Either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement will execute if any of the conditions described above are met. Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Both `a` and `b` are odd:**
   - If `a` and `b` are both odd, the condition is met, and the code will print 'YES'.

2. **At least one of `a` or `b` is even:**
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, and `a` is twice `b`, the condition is met.
   - If `b` is even and `a` is odd, and `b` is twice `a`, the condition is met.

3. **Neither of the above conditions is true:**
   - If `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0, and
   - If `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0, the condition is met.

Given the conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute because the conditions cover all possible cases for `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' based on the given conditions.

Output: **YES**
