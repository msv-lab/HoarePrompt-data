To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 as per the `range(n)` function. The other variables mentioned (`t`, `a`, and `b`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
