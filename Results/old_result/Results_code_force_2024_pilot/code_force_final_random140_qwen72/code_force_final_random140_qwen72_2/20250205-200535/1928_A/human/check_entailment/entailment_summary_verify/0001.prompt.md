You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It checks the following conditions for each pair `(a, b)`: if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly twice the other and the other is odd, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". After processing all `n` test cases, the function completes, having printed "YES" or "NO" for each pair of integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and then those two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (considering rotations).

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then cutting the rectangle will always result in smaller rectangles that cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original.
   - If either dimension is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, and there is a possibility of forming a new rectangle.

3. **Special Cases:**
   - If \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, or vice versa, we can cut the rectangle along the even dimension to get two smaller rectangles. These smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, we can always cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \(a = b\) and both are even, we can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) or \(a \times b/2\) rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If \(a = b\) and both are odd, no new rectangle can be formed.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints 'NO' because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - It checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other dimension is odd. If so, it prints 'NO' because the resulting smaller rectangles will be identical to the original when rearranged.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
