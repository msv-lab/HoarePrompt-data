Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `(b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0), the values of `a` and `b` remain as the integers entered by the user. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` also remain as the integers entered by the user.***
