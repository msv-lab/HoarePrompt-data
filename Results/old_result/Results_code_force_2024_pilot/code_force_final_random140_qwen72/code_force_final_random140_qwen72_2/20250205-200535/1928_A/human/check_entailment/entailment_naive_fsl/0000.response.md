Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0):` incorrectly identifies some valid cases as invalid. 

For example, consider the input `(4, 2)`:
- According to the problem description, the rectangle `4 x 2` can be cut into two `2 x 2` rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a `2 x 4` rectangle, which is different from the original `4 x 2` rectangle.
- However, the program will output `NO` for this input because `4 / 2 == 2` and `2 % 2 != 0`, which triggers the incorrect condition.

This shows that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
