To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and:
     - If `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or
     - If `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then the condition is met.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, then:
     - Either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0, and
     - Either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.

Given the conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will execute if none of the conditions are met. This means that if the conditions are not satisfied, the output will be 'NO'.

Let's break down the conditions:
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition is met.
- If `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, the condition is met.
- If `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, the condition is met.
- If none of the above conditions are true, the output will be 'NO'.

Since the problem states that the conditions are not met, the `print('NO')` statement will execute.

Output: **NO**
