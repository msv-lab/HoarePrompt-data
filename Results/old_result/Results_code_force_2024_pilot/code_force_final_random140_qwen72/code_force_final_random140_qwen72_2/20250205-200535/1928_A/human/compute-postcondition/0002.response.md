The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b`, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
