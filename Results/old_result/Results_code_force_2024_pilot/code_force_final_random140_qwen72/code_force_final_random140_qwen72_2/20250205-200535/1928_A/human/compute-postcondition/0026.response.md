Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` is the input integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each iteration, if both `a` and `b` are odd, "NO" is printed. If `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, "NO" is printed. Otherwise, "YES" is printed. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and the loop will have processed `n` pairs of integers `a` and `b` from the user input.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `a` and `b` are updated with new values from user input in each iteration.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the total number of iterations specified before the loop starts.
- The variable `i` increments from 0 to `n-1` over the course of the loop.
- The loop checks the conditions for each pair of `a` and `b` and prints "NO" or "YES" accordingly.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
