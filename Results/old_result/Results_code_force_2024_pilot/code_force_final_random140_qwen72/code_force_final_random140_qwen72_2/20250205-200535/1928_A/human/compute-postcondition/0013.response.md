The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the condition is met. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then the condition is met. If neither of these conditions is true, then either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0, and either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.**
