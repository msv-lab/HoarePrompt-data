You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    bottom_v = 1
    top_v = n
    idx = 0
    while idx < k:
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
        while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
            if idx % 2 == 0:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
                bottom_v += 1
            else:
                permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
                top_v -= 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
        idx += 1
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from standard input, where `t` represents the number of test cases and must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and `func_1` has been called `t` times, where `t` was initially an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The key is to ensure that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of these segments is at most 1.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - **Permutation Initialization**: It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - **Variable Initialization**: It sets `bottom_v` to 1 and `top_v` to `n`, which will be used to fill the permutation.
   - **Filling the Permutation**:
     - The outer loop runs from `idx = 0` to `idx < k`.
     - For each `idx`, it fills the positions in the permutation that are multiples of `k` plus `idx`.
     - If `idx` is even, it fills the position with the next smallest value (`bottom_v`).
     - If `idx` is odd, it fills the position with the next largest value (`top_v`).
   - **Output**: The permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: It calls `func_1()` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Permutation Construction**: The way the permutation is constructed ensures that the sums of the segments of length `k` are balanced. By alternating between the smallest and largest values, the sums of the segments are kept close to each other.
   - **Balanced Sums**: The construction method ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of the segments of length `k` is at most 1, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
