Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from standard input, where `t` represents the number of test cases and must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and `func_1` has been called `t` times, where `t` was initially an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The function does not return any value. **
