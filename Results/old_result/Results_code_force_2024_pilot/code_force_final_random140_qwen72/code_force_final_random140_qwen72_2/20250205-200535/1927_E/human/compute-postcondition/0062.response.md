To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
```

The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`. Let's look at the given state:

- `idx` is 2
- `k` is greater than 2
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2
- `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)` for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2
   - `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`

2. **Condition Check**:
   - For the loop to execute, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2, we need to ensure that `len(permutation)` is greater than 2.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
   - However, since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is already 2 and `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`, and `k` is greater than 2, `len(permutation)` will always be greater than 2.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed because the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)` is already satisfied.

### Final State:
State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`**
