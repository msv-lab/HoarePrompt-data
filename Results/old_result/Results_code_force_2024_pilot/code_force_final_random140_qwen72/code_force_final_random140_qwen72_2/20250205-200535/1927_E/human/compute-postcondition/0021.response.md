Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros. If `idx` is even, `permutation[0]` is set to 1, `permutation[k]` is set to `n`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[0]` is set to `n`, `permutation[k]` is set to `n - 1`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n - 2`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.***
