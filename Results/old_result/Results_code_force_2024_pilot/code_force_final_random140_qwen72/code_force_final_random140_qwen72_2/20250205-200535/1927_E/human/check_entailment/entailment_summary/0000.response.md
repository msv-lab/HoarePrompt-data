Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of generating a k-level permutation for each test case. The main logic is split into two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a permutation array of length `n` with zeros.
   - It fills the permutation array in a specific pattern:
     - For each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it fills the positions `i + j*k` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) with either increasing values starting from 1 (if `i` is even) or decreasing values starting from `n` (if `i` is odd).
   - This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, meeting the k-level permutation requirement.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, handling each test case individually.

The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints:
- It handles multiple test cases.
- It generates a k-level permutation for each test case.
- The permutation is constructed to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

Given the provided execution summaries and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
