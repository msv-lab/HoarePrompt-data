Output State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + 2*k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than `1 + k`. If `idx % 2 == 0`, `permutation[1 + k]` is set to `bottom_v + 1`. Otherwise, `permutation[1 + k]` is set to `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was initially `1 + k`.
- The code snippet `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` adds `k` to the current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
- Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now `1 + k + k`, which simplifies to `1 + 2*k`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
