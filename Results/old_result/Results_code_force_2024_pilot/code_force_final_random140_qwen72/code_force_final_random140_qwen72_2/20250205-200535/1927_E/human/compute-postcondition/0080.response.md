Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k`, `len(permutation)` must be greater than `2 + 2*k`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[2 + k]` is `bottom_v`, `bottom_v` is incremented by 3, and `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v - 2`. If `idx` is not divisible by 2, `permutation[2 + k]` is `top_v`, `top_v` is decreased by 1, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, and `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v - 1`. `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1.
- Since `idx` is 2 (which is even), `permutation[2 + k]` is set to `bottom_v` (after the increment).
- `bottom_v` was previously incremented by 2, so now it is incremented by 3 in total.
- `permutation[2]` is set to `bottom_v - 2` (since `bottom_v` is now 3 more than its original value).
- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to the new value of `bottom_v`.

All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
