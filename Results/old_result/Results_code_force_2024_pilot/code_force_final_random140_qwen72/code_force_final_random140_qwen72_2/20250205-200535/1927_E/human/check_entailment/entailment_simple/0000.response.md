Reasoning:  
The program aims to generate a k-level permutation for given n and k, following the specific rules outlined in the problem statement. Let's break down the correctness of the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually using a loop in `func_2`.

2. **Permutation Construction in `func_1`**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two pointers, `bottom_v` starting at 1 and `top_v` starting at `n`, to fill the permutation.
   - The loop iterates over indices from 0 to `k-1` and fills the permutation at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index.
   - If the index is even, it assigns the next value from `bottom_v` and increments `bottom_v`.
   - If the index is odd, it assigns the next value from `top_v` and decrements `top_v`.

3. **Ensuring k-Level Property**:
   - The construction method ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. This is achieved by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining values, which helps balance the sums across the permutation.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation, it converts the list to a string and prints it.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including the edge cases where `k` is 2 or `n` is small.
   - The use of `bottom_v` and `top_v` ensures that all numbers from 1 to `n` are used exactly once, forming a valid permutation.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to generate a k-level permutation for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
