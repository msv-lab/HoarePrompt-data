Output State: **`t` is 0, and `func_1` has been called `t` times where `t` was initially an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` is no longer greater than 0. Additionally, `func_1` will have been called exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial value of `t` before the loop started. Since `t` was initially an integer between 1 and 10^4, `func_1` will have been called that many times.
