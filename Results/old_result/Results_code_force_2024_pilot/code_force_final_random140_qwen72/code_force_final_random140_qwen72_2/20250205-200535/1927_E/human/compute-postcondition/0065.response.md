Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`, `idx` is even, `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v`, and `bottom_v` is `bottom_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
