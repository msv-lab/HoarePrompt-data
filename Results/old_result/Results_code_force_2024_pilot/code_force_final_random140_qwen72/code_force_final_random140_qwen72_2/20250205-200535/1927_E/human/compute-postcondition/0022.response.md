The code snippet `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros.
- If `idx` is even:
  - `permutation[0]` is set to 1,
  - `permutation[k]` is set to `n`,
  - `bottom_v` is 2,
  - `top_v` is `n - 1`,
  - `idx` is 0,
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.
- If `idx` is odd:
  - `permutation[0]` is set to `n`,
  - `permutation[k]` is set to `n - 1`,
  - `bottom_v` is 1,
  - `top_v` is `n - 2`,
  - `idx` is 0,
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented by `k`, so its new value is `2 * k`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, if `idx` is even, `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[k]` is `n`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[0]` is `n`, `permutation[k]` is `n - 1`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n - 2`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.**
