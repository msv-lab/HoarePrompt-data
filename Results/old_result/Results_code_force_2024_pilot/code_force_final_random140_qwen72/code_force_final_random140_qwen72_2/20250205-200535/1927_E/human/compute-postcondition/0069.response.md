Postcondition: ***`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v`, and `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. If `idx` is not divisible by 2, `permutation[2]` is `top_v - 1`, and `top_v` is decremented by 1.***
