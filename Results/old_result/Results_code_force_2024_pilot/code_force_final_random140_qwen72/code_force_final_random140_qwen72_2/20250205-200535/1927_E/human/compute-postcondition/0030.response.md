Output State: **The loop completes when `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` reaches or exceeds the length of the `permutation` list. At this point, the `permutation` list will be filled with alternating values starting from `bottom_v` (1) and `top_v` (`n`) at positions that are multiples of `k`. The final values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` will depend on the number of iterations, but they will be such that `bottom_v` is the next value that would have been assigned if the loop continued, and `top_v` is the next value that would have been assigned from the top. The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to the smallest multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`. The `idx` remains 0 throughout the loop.**
