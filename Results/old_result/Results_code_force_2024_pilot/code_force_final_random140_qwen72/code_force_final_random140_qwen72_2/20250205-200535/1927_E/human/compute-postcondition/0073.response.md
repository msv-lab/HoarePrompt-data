Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`, `permutation[2 + k]` is `bottom_v`, `bottom_v` is incremented by 2, `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `bottom_v` is incremented by 1.
- The code snippet `bottom_v += 1` increments `bottom_v` by 1 again.
- Therefore, `bottom_v` is now incremented by a total of 2 from its original value.
- Since `permutation[2]` is initially `bottom_v - 1`, after `bottom_v` is incremented by 2, `permutation[2]` becomes `bottom_v - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
