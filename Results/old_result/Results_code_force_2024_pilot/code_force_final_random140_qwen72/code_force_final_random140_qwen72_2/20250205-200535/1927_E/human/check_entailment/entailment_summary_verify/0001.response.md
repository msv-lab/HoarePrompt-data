Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The key is to ensure that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of these segments is at most 1.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - **Permutation Initialization**: It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - **Variable Initialization**: It sets `bottom_v` to 1 and `top_v` to `n`, which will be used to fill the permutation.
   - **Filling the Permutation**:
     - The outer loop runs from `idx = 0` to `idx < k`.
     - For each `idx`, it fills the positions in the permutation that are multiples of `k` plus `idx`.
     - If `idx` is even, it fills the position with the next smallest value (`bottom_v`).
     - If `idx` is odd, it fills the position with the next largest value (`top_v`).
   - **Output**: The permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: It calls `func_1()` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Permutation Construction**: The way the permutation is constructed ensures that the sums of the segments of length `k` are balanced. By alternating between the smallest and largest values, the sums of the segments are kept close to each other.
   - **Balanced Sums**: The construction method ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of the segments of length `k` is at most 1, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

5. **Verification**:
   - **Example Test Cases**:
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `2 1`. The sums of the segments are `2 + 1 = 3` and `1 + 2 = 3`, which differ by 0.
     - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the output is `1 3 2`. The sums of the segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`, which differ by 1.
     - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. The sums of the segments are:
       - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
       - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
       - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
       - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
       - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
       - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
       - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
     - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 23, which differ by 1.

Given the above analysis and verification, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

Final: **True**
