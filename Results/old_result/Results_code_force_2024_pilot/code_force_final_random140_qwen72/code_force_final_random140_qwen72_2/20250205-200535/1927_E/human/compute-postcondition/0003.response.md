The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), after decrementing, `t` will be an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive). The function `func_1` has been called, but its internal operations and any changes it might make to the environment or variables are not specified, so no further changes to the state can be determined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), and `func_1` has been called.**
