Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` and `k` are updated based on user input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while idx < k:
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
    while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
        if idx % 2 == 0:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
            bottom_v += 1
        else:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
            top_v -= 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
    idx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop completes when `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` reaches or exceeds the length of the `permutation` list. At this point, the `permutation` list will be filled with alternating values starting from `bottom_v` (1) and `top_v` (`n`) at positions that are multiples of `k`. The final values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` will depend on the number of iterations, but they will be such that `bottom_v` is the next value that would have been assigned if the loop continued, and `top_v` is the next value that would have been assigned from the top. The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to the smallest multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`. The `idx` is now 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + n*k` where `n` is the number of iterations, and `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`. The elements in `permutation` at positions `1 + i*k` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) are set to either `bottom_v + i` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `top_v - i` if `idx % 2 != 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `idx` is 3, `k` is still greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + n*k`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`. If `idx` is not divisible by 2, `permutation[2 + i*k]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` are set to `top_v - i`, and `top_v` is decremented by `n`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
