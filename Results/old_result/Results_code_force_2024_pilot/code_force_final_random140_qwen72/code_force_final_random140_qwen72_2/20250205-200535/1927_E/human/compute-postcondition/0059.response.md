Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + n*k` where `n` is the number of iterations, and `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`. The elements in `permutation` at positions `1 + i*k` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) are set to either `bottom_v + i` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `top_v - i` if `idx % 2 != 0`.**

Explanation:
- `idx` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged:
  - `k` is still greater than 1.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains `1 + n*k` where `n` is the number of iterations.
  - `len(permutation)` is still greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`.
  - The elements in `permutation` at positions `1 + i*k` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) are still set to either `bottom_v + i` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `top_v - i` if `idx % 2 != 0`. Since `idx` is now 2, which is even, these elements will be set to `bottom_v + i`.
