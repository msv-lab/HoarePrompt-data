The variables in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + k`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must still be less than `len(permutation)`.

Given that `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which is `1 + k`) is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `len(permutation)` must be greater than `1 + k`.

State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + k`, and `len(permutation)` must be greater than `1 + k`**
