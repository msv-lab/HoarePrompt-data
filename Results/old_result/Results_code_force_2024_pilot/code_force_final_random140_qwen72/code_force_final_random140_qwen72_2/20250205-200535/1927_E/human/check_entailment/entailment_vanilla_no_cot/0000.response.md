Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The approach taken in `func_1` constructs a permutation that satisfies the conditions of being a k-level permutation. It alternates between placing the smallest and largest remaining numbers at positions determined by the index modulo k, ensuring that the sums of every k consecutive elements vary by at most 1. The outer function `func_2` handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach should work correctly for all valid inputs.
