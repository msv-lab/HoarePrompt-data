Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`, `permutation[2 + k]` is `top_v`, `top_v` is unchanged, `bottom_v` is unchanged, `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v` (since `idx` is even).** 

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` remains 2.
- The value of `k` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains `2 + k`.
- The length of `permutation` remains greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`.
- Since `idx` is even, `permutation[2]` is set to `bottom_v`, and `bottom_v` is incremented by 1.
- The code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v` sets the element at index `2 + k` in the `permutation` list to `top_v`.
- The value of `top_v` remains unchanged.
- The value of `bottom_v` remains unchanged.
