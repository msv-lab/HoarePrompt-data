Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` which is set to `bottom_v`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v` sets the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in the `permutation` list to `bottom_v`.
- Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k` and `bottom_v` is 2, the value at index `k` in the `permutation` list is now 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
