Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros.
- If `idx` is even:
  - `permutation[0]` is set to 1.
  - `bottom_v` is 2.
  - `top_v` is `n`.
  - `idx` is 0.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.
- If `idx` is odd:
  - `permutation[0]` is set to `n`.
  - `bottom_v` is 1.
  - `top_v` is `n - 1`.
  - `idx` is 0.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`:**
   - Since `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.

2. **Determine the value of `top_v`:**
   - If `idx` is even, `top_v` is `n`.
   - If `idx` is odd, `top_v` is `n - 1`.

3. **Update the `permutation` list:**
   - The code sets `permutation[k]` to `top_v`.

### Output State:
- If `idx` is even:
  - `permutation[0]` is 1.
  - `permutation[k]` is `n`.
  - `bottom_v` is 2.
  - `top_v` is `n`.
  - `idx` is 0.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.
- If `idx` is odd:
  - `permutation[0]` is `n`.
  - `permutation[k]` is `n - 1`.
  - `bottom_v` is 1.
  - `top_v` is `n - 1`.
  - `idx` is 0.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **If `idx` is even: `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[k]` is `n`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`. If `idx` is odd: `permutation[0]` is `n`, `permutation[k]` is `n - 1`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.**
