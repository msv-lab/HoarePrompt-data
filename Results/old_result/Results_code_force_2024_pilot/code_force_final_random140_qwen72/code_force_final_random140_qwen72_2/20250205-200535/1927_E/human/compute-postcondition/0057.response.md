The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated by adding `k` to its current value. Initially, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + 2*k`. After adding `k`, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + 2*k + k`, which simplifies to `1 + 3*k`.

The other variables (`idx`, `k`, `len(permutation)`, `permutation[1 + 2*k]`, `bottom_v`, and `top_v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + 3*k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than `1 + k`. If `idx % 2 == 0`, `permutation[1 + 2*k]` is `bottom_v + 1`. Otherwise, `permutation[1 + 2*k]` is set to `top_v - 1`, and `top_v` is decreased by 1.**
