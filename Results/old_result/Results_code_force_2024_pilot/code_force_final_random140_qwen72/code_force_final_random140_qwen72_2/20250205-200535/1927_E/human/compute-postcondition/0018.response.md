Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` which is set to `bottom_v`, `bottom_v` is 3, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
