The variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. If `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of `permutation`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than the length of `permutation`.

Given that `permutation` is a list of length `n`, the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is currently `2 * k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `2 * k` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed as long as `2 * k < n`, which is consistent with the given conditions (2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5).

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, if `idx` is even, `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[k]` is `n`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[0]` is `n`, `permutation[k]` is `n - 1`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n - 2`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.**
