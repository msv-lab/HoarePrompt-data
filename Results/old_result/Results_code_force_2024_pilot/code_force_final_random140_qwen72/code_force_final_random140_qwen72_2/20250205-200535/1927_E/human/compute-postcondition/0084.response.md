Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 3*k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than `2 + 2*k`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[2 + k]` is `bottom_v`, `bottom_v` is incremented by 3, and `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v - 2`. Additionally, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`. If `idx` is not divisible by 2, `permutation[2 + k]` is `top_v`, `top_v` is decreased by 1, `bottom_v` remains unchanged, and `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v`. Also, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k`.
- The code snippet `multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k` increments `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by `k`.
- Therefore, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k + k`, which simplifies to `2 + 3*k`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
