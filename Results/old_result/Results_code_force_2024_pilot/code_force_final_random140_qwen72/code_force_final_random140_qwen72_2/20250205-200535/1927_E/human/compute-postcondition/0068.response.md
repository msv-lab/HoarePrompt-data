Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`, `idx` is not divisible by 2, `permutation[2]` is `top_v - 1`, `top_v` is `top_v - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
