Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros.
- If `idx` is even:
  - `permutation[0]` is 1.
  - `permutation[k]` is `n`.
  - `bottom_v` is 2.
  - `top_v` is `n - 1`.
  - `idx` is 0.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.
- If `idx` is odd:
  - `permutation[0]` is `n`.
  - `permutation[k]` is `n - 1`.
  - `bottom_v` is 1.
  - `top_v` is `n - 2`.
  - `idx` is 0.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.

The code snippet:
```
permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`:**
   - Given `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.

2. **Identify the Value of `bottom_v`:**
   - Since `idx` is 0 (even), `bottom_v` is 2.

3. **Update the `permutation` List:**
   - The code sets `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` to `bottom_v`.
   - Therefore, `permutation[2 * k]` is set to 2.

### Output State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros.
- `permutation[0]` is 1.
- `permutation[k]` is `n`.
- `permutation[2 * k]` is 2.
- `bottom_v` is 2.
- `top_v` is `n - 1`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[k]` is `n`, `permutation[2 * k]` is 2, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.**
