Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The key is to ensure that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of these segments is at most 1.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - **Permutation Initialization**: It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - **Variable Initialization**: It sets `bottom_v` to 1 and `top_v` to `n`, which will be used to fill the permutation.
   - **Filling the Permutation**:
     - The outer loop runs from `idx = 0` to `idx < k`.
     - For each `idx`, it fills the positions in the permutation that are multiples of `k` plus `idx`.
     - If `idx` is even, it fills the position with the next smallest value (`bottom_v`).
     - If `idx` is odd, it fills the position with the next largest value (`top_v`).
   - **Output**: The permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: It calls `func_1()` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Permutation Construction**: The way the permutation is constructed ensures that the sums of the segments of length `k` are balanced. By alternating between the smallest and largest values, the sums of the segments are kept close to each other.
   - **Balanced Sums**: The construction method ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of the segments of length `k` is at most 1, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
