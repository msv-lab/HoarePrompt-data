The provided code snippet calls the function `func_1()`. Since the initial state mentions that `func_1` has already been called, calling it again does not provide additional information about changes to variables unless the function's behavior or side effects are known. However, since no specific details about `func_1` are provided, we cannot determine any changes to the state or variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), and `func_1` has been called.**
