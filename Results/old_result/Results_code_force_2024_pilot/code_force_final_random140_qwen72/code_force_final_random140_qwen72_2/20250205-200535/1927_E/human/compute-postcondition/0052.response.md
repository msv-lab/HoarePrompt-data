Output State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + 2*k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than `1 + k`, `permutation[1 + 2*k]` is `bottom_v`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `bottom_v` to the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, which is calculated as `1 + 2*k`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
