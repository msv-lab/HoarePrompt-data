To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that this condition remains true for the next iteration.

### Current State:
- `idx` is 1
- `k` is greater than 1
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + 2*k`
- `len(permutation)` is greater than `1 + k`

### Analysis:
1. **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx`**: This is calculated as `1 + 2*k`.
2. **`len(permutation)`**: This is greater than `1 + k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `len(permutation)`. Given the current values:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx = 1 + 2*k`
- `len(permutation) > 1 + k`

We need to ensure that `1 + 2*k < len(permutation)`. Since `len(permutation) > 1 + k`, it is sufficient to check if `1 + 2*k` is still less than `len(permutation)`.

### Conclusion:
Since `k` is greater than 1, `1 + 2*k` will always be greater than `1 + k`. Therefore, if `len(permutation)` is greater than `1 + k`, it will also be greater than `1 + 2*k`. Thus, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)` will hold true for the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
No adjustments are needed to the states of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` or `len(permutation)` because the current state already ensures that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + 2*k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than `1 + k`**
