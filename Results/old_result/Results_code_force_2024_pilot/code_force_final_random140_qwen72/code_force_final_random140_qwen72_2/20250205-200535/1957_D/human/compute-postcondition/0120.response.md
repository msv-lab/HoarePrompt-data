The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `32`, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `32`. If `j` is less than `32`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is `n + 1`, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[n + 1]`, `y` is now the last element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`. If the 1st bit of `c` is 1, `pre[1][1]` is now 3, `suf[0][1]` is now `y - 2`, and `suf[1][1]` is now `suf[1][1] - 1`. If the 1st bit of `c` is 0, `pre[1][0]` is now `pre[1][0] + 1`, `suf[0][1]` is now `y`, and `suf[1][0]` is now `suf[1][0] - 1`.**
