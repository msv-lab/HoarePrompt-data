Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is now a list of 32 sublists where each sublist at index `j` has been updated based on the `j`-th bit of `c`: if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, the sublist is [32, 1]; if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, the sublist is [33, 0]. `suf` is now a list of 32 sublists where each sublist at index `j` has been updated based on the `j`-th bit of `c`: if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, the sublist is [x, y-1]; if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, the sublist is [x-1, y]. `i` is `n + 1`, `cur`, `ans`, and `c` remain unchanged, `y` is now the last element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1.** 

Explanation: The variable `k` is set to the bit length of `y` minus 1. Since `y` is the last element of `arr`, `k` will be the highest bit position that is set in `y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
