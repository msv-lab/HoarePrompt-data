The code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the sublist at index `j` in the `suf` list by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is 0, and the least significant bit of `cur` is 1. The `suf` list initially contains 32 sublists, each with two zeros `[0, 0]`.

After executing the code, the second element of the first sublist in `suf` (i.e., `suf[0][1]`) is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0] except `suf[0][1]` which is 1, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 0, and the least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> j & 1`) is 1.**
