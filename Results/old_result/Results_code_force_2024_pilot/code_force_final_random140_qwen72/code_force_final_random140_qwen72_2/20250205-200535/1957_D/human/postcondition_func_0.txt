The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. It computes a value `ans` based on the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` and the bit counts of these cumulative XOR values. The function then prints the computed value `ans`. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and it processes each test case independently. After processing, the function prints the result for each test case.
