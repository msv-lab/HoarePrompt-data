Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least two elements, `prefix` is a list containing three elements `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ (v ^ 0)]`, `v` is the second element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the `prefix` list. Initially, `prefix` contains `[0, v ^ 0]`. The last element of `prefix` is `v ^ 0`, so the new element appended is `v ^ (v ^ 0)`. Since `v ^ 0` is `v`, the new element is `v ^ v`, which simplifies to `0`. Therefore, the updated `prefix` list is `[0, v ^ 0, 0]`. However, since `v ^ 0` is just `v`, the final `prefix` list is `[0, v, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
