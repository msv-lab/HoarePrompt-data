Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0] except for `suf[1]` which is [0, 2] if the second least significant bit of `cur` is 1, or [1, 1] if the second least significant bit of `cur` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 2, and `suf[2][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the first element of the sublist at index `j` (which is 2) in the list `suf`. Initially, `suf[2][0]` is 0, so after the increment, `suf[2][0]` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
