Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the count of bits in `cur` that are 0 and `y` is the count of bits in `cur` that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`, `j` is 1. If the bit at position 1 in `cur` is 1, then the second element of the sublist at index 1 in `suf` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of the sublist at index 1 in `suf` is incremented by 1.***
