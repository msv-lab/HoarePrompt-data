Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: This variable also remains unchanged as it represents the length of the `arr` list and is not modified within the loop.
- **`arr`**: This list remains unchanged as it is only being iterated over and not modified within the loop.
- **`prefix`**: After the loop has executed `n` times, the `prefix` list will contain `n + 1` elements. Each element in `prefix` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point. Specifically:
  - `prefix[0]` is `0`.
  - `prefix[1]` is `arr[0] ^ 0`.
  - `prefix[2]` is `arr[1] ^ prefix[1]`.
  - ...
  - `prefix[n]` is `arr[n-1] ^ prefix[n-1]`.

This means that `prefix[i]` for any `i` (where `0 ≤ i ≤ n`) is the result of XORing all elements in `arr` from index `0` to `i-1`.
