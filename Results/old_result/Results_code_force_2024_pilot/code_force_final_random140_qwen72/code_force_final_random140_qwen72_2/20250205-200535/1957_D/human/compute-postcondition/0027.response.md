To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements.
- `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point.
- `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0].
- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0] except for the following: if the least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> j & 1`) is 1, then `suf[j]` is [0, 1]; otherwise, `suf[j]` is [1, 0].
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `cur` is `prefix[n]`.
- `j` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(32):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 31 (inclusive).
- The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the start of the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 32.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 0.

### State After Adjustment:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0] except for the following: if the least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> j & 1`) is 1, then `suf[j]` is [0, 1]; otherwise, `suf[j]` is [1, 0]. `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, and `j` is 1.**
