You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the final computed value after all iterations of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. It computes a value `ans` based on the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` and the bit counts of these cumulative XOR values. The function then prints the computed value `ans`. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and it processes each test case independently. After processing, the function prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in the `prefix` list. This is done correctly using the formula `prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] ^ arr[i-1]`.

3. **Pre and Suf Arrays**:
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are used to keep track of the counts of bits set to 0 and 1 at each position from 0 to 31.
   - Initially, `pre` is set to count the number of leading zeros (since the prefix starts with 0).

4. **Suf Array Initialization**:
   - The `suf` array is initialized by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning, updating the counts of bits set to 0 and 1 for each prefix value.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates over each element in the array.
   - For each element, it calculates the bit position `k` of the highest set bit in the current element `y`.
   - It then updates the answer `ans` by adding the product of the counts of bits set to 0 and 1 in the `pre` and `suf` arrays at position `k`.
   - Finally, it updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays to reflect the current prefix value.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the program prints the final answer `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the prefix XOR and updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays is correct.
- The main loop correctly updates the answer based on the conditions specified in the problem.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
