Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, and `j` is 2. If the third least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> 2 & 1`) is 1, then `suf[1]` is [1, 1] and `suf[2]` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `suf[1]` is [0, 2] if the second least significant bit of `cur` is 1, or [1, 1] if the second least significant bit of `cur` is 0, and `suf[2][0]` is 1.***
