You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: After the loop executes all `n` iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is `n + 1`, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists where each sublist at index `j` has been updated based on the `j`-th bit of each `c` value encountered during the loop, and `suf` is a list of 32 sublists where each sublist at index `j` has been updated based on the `j`-th bit of each `c` value encountered during the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the final computed value after all iterations of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns or prints a result for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
