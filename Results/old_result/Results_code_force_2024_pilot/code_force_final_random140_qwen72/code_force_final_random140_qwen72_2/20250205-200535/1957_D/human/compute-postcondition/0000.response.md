Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `n` is now an input integer.**
