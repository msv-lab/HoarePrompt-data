Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0] except for the sublist at index `j` which now contains [33, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 0 and `y` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, and the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0.**
