The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the list `prefix`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least two elements.
- `prefix` initially contains three elements `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ (v ^ 0)]`. After the code execution, `prefix` will have an additional element, which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`.
- `v` remains the third element in `arr`.

Let's calculate the new value added to `prefix`:
- `prefix[-1]` before appending is `v ^ (v ^ 0)`, which simplifies to `0` because `v ^ v` is `0`.
- Therefore, `v ^ prefix[-1]` is `v ^ 0`, which is `v`.

So, the new element appended to `prefix` is `v`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least two elements, `prefix` is a list containing four elements `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ (v ^ 0), v]`, `v` is the third element in `arr`.**
