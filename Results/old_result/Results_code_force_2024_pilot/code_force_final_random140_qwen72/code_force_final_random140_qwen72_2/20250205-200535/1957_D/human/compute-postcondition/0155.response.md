To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n`: An integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr`: A list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements.
   - `prefix`: A list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point.
   - `i`: `n + 1`.
   - `cur`: `prefix[1]`.
   - `ans`: The final computed value after all iterations.
   - `pre`: A list of 32 sublists where each sublist at index `j` has been updated based on the `j`-th bit of each `c` value encountered during the loop.
   - `suf`: A list of 32 sublists where each sublist at index `j` has been updated based on the `j`-th bit of each `c` value encountered during the loop.

2. **Understanding the Context:**
   - The `prefix` list is constructed such that `prefix[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`.
   - The `pre` and `suf` lists are used to keep track of the bits of the elements encountered during the loop.
   - The `ans` variable is the final computed value after all iterations of the loop.

3. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - Since the exact algorithm or logic used to compute `ans` is not provided, we can only infer that `ans` is the result of some computation involving the elements of `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, and `suf`.
   - The value of `ans` is the final result after all iterations of the loop have completed.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **ans (where ans is the final computed value after all iterations of the loop)**

This output reflects the fact that `ans` is the result of the computations performed during the loop, but without the specific details of the algorithm, we cannot provide an exact numerical value.
