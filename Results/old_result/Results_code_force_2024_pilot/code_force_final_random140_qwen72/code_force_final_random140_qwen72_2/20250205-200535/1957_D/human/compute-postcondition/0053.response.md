Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the count of bits in `cur` that are 0 and `y` is the count of bits in `cur` that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-1]`, `j` is 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each bit position `j` from 0 to 31.
- For each bit position, the loop checks whether the bit at that position in `cur` (which is `prefix[n-1]`) is 1 or 0.
- If the bit is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1.
- If the bit is 0, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `suf` will contain the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position in `cur`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `i`, and `cur`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
