Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 32, `ans` is now `ans + Σ(pre[j][0] * suf[j][0] + pre[j][1] * suf[j][1]) for j in range(32)`. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates 32 times, once for each bit position from 0 to 31.
- After each iteration, the value of `j` is incremented by 1 until it reaches 32.
- During each iteration, the bit at position `j` in `c` is checked. If it is 1, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. If it is 0, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.
- The final value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `pre[j][0]` and `suf[j][0]` plus the product of `pre[j][1]` and `suf[j][1]` for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `i`, `cur`, `c`, `y`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
