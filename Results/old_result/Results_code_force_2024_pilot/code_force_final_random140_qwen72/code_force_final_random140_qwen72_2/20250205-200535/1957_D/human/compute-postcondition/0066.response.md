The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `32`, so we can only adjust `j`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 31 (inclusive), meaning `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 until it reaches 32. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the count of bits in `cur` that are 0 and `y` is the count of bits in `cur` that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`, `j` is 2.**
