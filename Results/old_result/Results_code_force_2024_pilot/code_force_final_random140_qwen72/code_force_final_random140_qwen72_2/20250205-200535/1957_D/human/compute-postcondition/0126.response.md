Output State: **After the loop executes all 32 iterations: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is `n + 1`, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[n + 1]`, `y` is now the last element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `j` is 31, and `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`. For each bit position `j` (from 0 to 31), if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is now `pre[j][1] + 1` and `suf[j][1]` is now `suf[j][1] - 1`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is now `pre[j][0] + 1` and `suf[j][0]` is now `suf[j][0] - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `i`, `cur`, `c`, `y`, `k`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`j`**: After 32 iterations, `j` will be 31 (since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to 31).
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, it is incremented by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.
- **`pre` and `suf`**: For each bit position `j` (from 0 to 31), the corresponding sublists in `pre` and `suf` are updated based on the `j`-th bit of `c`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.
