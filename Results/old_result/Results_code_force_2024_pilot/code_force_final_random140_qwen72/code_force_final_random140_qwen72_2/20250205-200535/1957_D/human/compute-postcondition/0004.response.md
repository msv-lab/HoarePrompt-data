Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one element, `prefix` is a list containing two elements `[0, v ^ 0]`, `v` is the first element in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `prefix` is a list containing a single element `[0]`.
- The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to `prefix`.
- Since `prefix[-1]` is `0`, the expression `v ^ prefix[-1]` simplifies to `v ^ 0`, which is just `v`.
- Therefore, `prefix` now contains two elements: `[0, v]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `v`) remain unchanged.
