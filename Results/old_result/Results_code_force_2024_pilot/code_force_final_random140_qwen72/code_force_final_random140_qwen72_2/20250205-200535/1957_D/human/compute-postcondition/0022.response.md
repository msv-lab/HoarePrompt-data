Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 0, and the least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> j & 1`) is 1.**
