Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 0 and `y` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
