Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 31, and `ans` is now the initial value of `ans` before any iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = arr[i - 1]` assigns the value of the first element of `arr` to `y`.
- Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0, which corresponds to the first element of `arr`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
