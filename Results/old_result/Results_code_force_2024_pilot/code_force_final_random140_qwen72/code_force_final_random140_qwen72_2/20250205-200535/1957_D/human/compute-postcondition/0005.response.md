The only objects in the loop head are the variable `v` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `v` was the first element in `arr`, and `arr` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must contain at least two elements. The next value of `v` will be the second element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least two elements, `prefix` is a list containing two elements `[0, v ^ 0]`, `v` is the second element in `arr`.**
