The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 31 (inclusive), meaning `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 32.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 32.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`. If the bit at position `j` in `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.**
