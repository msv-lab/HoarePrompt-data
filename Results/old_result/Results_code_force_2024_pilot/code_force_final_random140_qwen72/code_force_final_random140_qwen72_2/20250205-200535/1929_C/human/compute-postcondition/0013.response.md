Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is the result of the expression `s = 1 + sum((s // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x))`, `i` is `x - 1`**

Explanation:
- The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
