Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins given the constraints of the casino's betting system. The key logic in the program is the calculation of `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can recover from a series of losses and still end up with more coins.

The logic of the program is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. It initializes `s` to 1, representing the smallest possible bet.
3. It then iterates `x` times, simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times consecutively. In each iteration, it updates `s` using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula accounts for the fact that after each loss, Sasha needs to have enough coins to cover the next bet, which should be large enough to recover from the previous losses and still make a profit.
4. After the loop, it checks if the initial number of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The logic of the program is sound because:
- The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to recover from `x` consecutive losses.
- The condition `a >= s` ensures that Sasha starts with enough coins to follow the betting strategy and guarantee a win.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
