The code snippet `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. This operation changes the values of these variables based on the input provided.

- `k` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `x` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is the result of the expression `s = 1 + sum((s // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x))`, `i` is `x - 1`**.
