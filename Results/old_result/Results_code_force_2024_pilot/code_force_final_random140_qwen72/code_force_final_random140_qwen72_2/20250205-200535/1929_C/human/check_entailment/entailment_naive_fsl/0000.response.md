Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `s` does not accurately reflect the conditions under which Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins.

### Issue:
The program calculates `s` using the formula:
```python
s = 1
for i in range(x):
    s += s // (k - 1) + 1
```
This formula attempts to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins after a series of wins and losses, but it does not correctly account for the constraints and the way the casino operates.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case `(k, x, a) = (2, 1, 1)`:
- According to the problem, Sasha starts with 1 coin and can only bet 1 coin.
- If Sasha loses, he will have 0 coins and cannot place any more bets.
- The program outputs `NO` for this case, which is correct.

However, consider another test case `(k, x, a) = (2, 3, 15)`:
- The program outputs `YES` for this case.
- The logic in the program suggests that Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins with 15 initial coins, but this is not necessarily true. The program does not correctly simulate the betting strategy that would ensure Sasha can always reach any desired number of coins.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Simulate the betting process considering the maximum number of consecutive losses (`x`).
2. Ensure that after any sequence of losses, Sasha can still recover and reach any desired number of coins.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for certain test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
