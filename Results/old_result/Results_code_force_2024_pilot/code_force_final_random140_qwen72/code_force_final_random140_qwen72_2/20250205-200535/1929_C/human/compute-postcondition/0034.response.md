Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting with `s = 1`.
- `i` is `x - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `s`:**
   - `s` starts with the value 1.

2. **Expression Execution:**
   - The expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is executed `x` times.
   - This means that for each iteration, the value of `s` is updated according to the formula.

3. **Understanding the Expression:**
   - `s // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `s` by `(k - 1)`.
   - The result of this division is added to 1.
   - This sum is then added to the current value of `s`.

4. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the value of `s` after the `j`-th iteration as `s_j`.
   - Initially, `s_0 = 1`.
   - After the first iteration: `s_1 = s_0 + (s_0 // (k - 1)) + 1`.
   - After the second iteration: `s_2 = s_1 + (s_1 // (k - 1)) + 1`.
   - And so on, until the `x`-th iteration.

5. **Final Value of `s`:**
   - The final value of `s` after `x` iterations is denoted as `s_x`.

6. **Comparison with `a`:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s_x`.
   - If `a >= s_x`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Final Output:
The output depends on the values of `a` and `s_x`. Since the exact values of `k` and `x` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **'YES' if a >= s_x else 'NO' (where s_x is the value of s after x iterations of the expression s += s // (k - 1) + 1 starting with s = 1)**
