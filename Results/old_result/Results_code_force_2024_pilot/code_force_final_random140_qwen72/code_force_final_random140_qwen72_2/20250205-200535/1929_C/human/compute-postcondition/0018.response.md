Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `s` is 1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `s` is calculated as `1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1))`.
- The code snippet updates `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- The new value of `s` is therefore `1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
