The code snippet `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t`

After executing the code snippet, the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer.**
