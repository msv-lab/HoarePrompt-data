Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting with `s = 1` for each of the `t` test cases, and `i` is `x - 1` for the last iteration of the inner loop in the last test case.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The number of test cases remains unchanged as it determines how many times the outer loop will run.
- **`k`, `x`, `a`**: These are input values for each test case and are read from the input for each iteration of the outer loop.
- **`s`**: For each test case, `s` starts at 1 and is updated by the inner loop `x` times using the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- **`i`**: After the inner loop completes for the last test case, `i` will be `x - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed.
