You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `_` is equal to the initial value of `t` (the number of test cases), `n`, `k`, and `x` retain their values from the last test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the last test case in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` from the last test case, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements for each test case, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop. The variable `i` has been incremented through the loop from 0 to `k` for each test case, and `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it handles the removal and negation of elements. Specifically, the logic for calculating the new sum after Alice's and Bob's moves is not entirely correct. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Sorting and Reversing the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This means the largest elements come first. However, this might not always lead to the optimal solution because Alice and Bob's strategies depend on both the smallest and largest values.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `sum1` is calculated correctly. However, the way the new sum is calculated after considering Alice's and Bob's moves is flawed.

3. **Negation Logic**: The program attempts to negate the smallest elements (which are at the end of the sorted array). However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where Bob might choose to negate the largest negative values to minimize the sum.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` or `x` are very large or when the array contains many negative values.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 2
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
- **Expected Output**: 0
- **Actual Output**: -2

**Explanation**:
- Alice can remove the two smallest elements (-5 and -4), leaving the array as [-1, -2, -3].
- Bob can then negate the two largest remaining elements (-1 and -2), resulting in the array [1, 2, -3].
- The sum of the array is 1 + 2 - 3 = 0.

However, the program calculates the sum incorrectly and outputs -2, which is not the optimal result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
