Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing three elements (the original element, `sums`, and the updated `sums`), `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.** 

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.
- The original state of `ans` was a list containing two elements: the original element and the initial value of `sums`.
- After appending `sums`, `ans` now contains three elements: the original element, the initial value of `sums`, and the updated value of `sums`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- The condition `i < k + 1` must still be true for the loop to continue executing.
