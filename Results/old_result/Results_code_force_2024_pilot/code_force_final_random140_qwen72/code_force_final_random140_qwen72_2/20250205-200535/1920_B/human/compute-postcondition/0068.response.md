Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to its current value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
