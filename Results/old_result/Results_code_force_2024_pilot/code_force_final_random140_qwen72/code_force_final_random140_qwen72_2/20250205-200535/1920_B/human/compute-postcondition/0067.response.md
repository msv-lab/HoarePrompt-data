The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables such as `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, or `i`. However, the list `ans` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements (the original element and the new element which is the value of `sums`), `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
