The value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise, it is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and now also contains the value `sums`, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
