The code snippet `a.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The reversed list `a` will now have its elements in the opposite order compared to before.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop, `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop, the input integer must be greater than 1.**
