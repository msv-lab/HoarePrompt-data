The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the new input integer
- `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2
- `x` is the new input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing two values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, and the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`.
- `sums` is now `sums + a[3]`
- `i` is 4

The value of `sums` is added to the list `ans`. Since `ans` already contains two values, after appending `sums`, `ans` will contain three values.

Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing three values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`, and the third value is `sums`, `sums` is now `sums + a[3]`, `i` is 4.**
