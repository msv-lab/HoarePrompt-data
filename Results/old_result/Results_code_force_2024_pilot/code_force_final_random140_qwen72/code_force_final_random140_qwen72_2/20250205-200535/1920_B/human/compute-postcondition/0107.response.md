The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the impact of this operation:

- `ans` is initially a list containing a single value, which is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums` if `i` is not 0. Since `i` is 3, `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` before this operation.
- The value of `sums` is appended to `ans`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums` if `i` is not 0, and the second value is `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]`, `sums` is `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]`, the input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is 3.**
