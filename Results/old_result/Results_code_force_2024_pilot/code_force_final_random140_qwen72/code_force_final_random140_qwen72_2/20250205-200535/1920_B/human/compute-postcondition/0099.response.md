The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` from the list `a` to it. Let's break down the impact:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, the input integer must be greater than 1, `i` is not 0, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
