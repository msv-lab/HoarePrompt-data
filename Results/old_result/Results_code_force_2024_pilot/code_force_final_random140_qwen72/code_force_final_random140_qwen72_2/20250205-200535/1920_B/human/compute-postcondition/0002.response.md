The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`. The variables `_`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input (each greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
