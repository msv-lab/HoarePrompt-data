The code `a.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in the list `a`. This operation modifies the list `a` in place, changing its order from ascending to descending. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input (each greater than 0), `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order.**
