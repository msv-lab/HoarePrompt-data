The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Here's the detailed step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `_` is 2
   - `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1)
   - `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 2)
   - `x` is the new input integer
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
   - `ans` is a list containing two values:
     - The first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`
     - The second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`
   - `sums` is now `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`
   - `i` is 4

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `ans` now contains three values:
     - The first value remains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`
     - The second value remains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`
     - The third value is `sums` (which is `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`)

4. **Output State**:
   - `_` is 2
   - `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1)
   - `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 2)
   - `x` is the new input integer
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
   - `ans` is a list containing three values:
     - The first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`
     - The second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`
     - The third value is `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`
   - `sums` is `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`
   - `i` is 4

Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1), `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 2), `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing three values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`, the third value is `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`, `sums` is `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`, `i` is 4.**
