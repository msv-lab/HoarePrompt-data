To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the code).
- `n` is a new input integer (must be greater than 1).
- `k` is a new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 0).
- `x` is a new input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values where each value is calculated based on the loop conditions:
  - The first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
  - Subsequent values are updated as follows:
    - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
    - If `i + x - 1 ≥ n`, then `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- `sums` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop, which is the last element in the list `ans`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **First Value Calculation**:
   - The first value in `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
   - This means we take the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of `a` (which are the largest elements since `a` is sorted in reverse order), multiply it by 2, and subtract this from `sum1`.

3. **Subsequent Values Calculation**:
   - For each subsequent value in `ans` (from the second to the `k + 1`-th value):
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, update the current value as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 ≥ n`, update the current value as `sums + a[i - 1]`.

4. **Final Value**:
   - After the loop, `sums` is the last value in `ans`.

5. **Finding the Maximum**:
   - The `max(ans)` function will find the maximum value in the list `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `n = 5`
- `k = 2`
- `x = 2`
- `a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (sorted in reverse order)

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - `sum1 = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15`

2. **First Value**:
   - `sum(a[:x + 1]) = sum([5, 4, 3]) = 12`
   - First value in `ans` = `15 - 2 * 12 = 15 - 24 = -9`

3. **Subsequent Values**:
   - For `i = 2`:
     - `i + x - 1 = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3 < 5`
     - `sums = -9 + 4 - 2 * 2 = -9 + 4 - 4 = -9`
   - For `i = 3`:
     - `i + x - 1 = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 < 5`
     - `sums = -9 + 3 - 2 * 1 = -9 + 3 - 2 = -8`

4. **Final List**:
   - `ans = [-9, -9, -8]`

5. **Maximum Value**:
   - `max(ans) = -8`

### Final Output:
Output: **-8 (where -8 is the maximum value in the list `ans`)**

This output is based on the specific example provided. For different inputs, the values will vary, but the process remains the same.
