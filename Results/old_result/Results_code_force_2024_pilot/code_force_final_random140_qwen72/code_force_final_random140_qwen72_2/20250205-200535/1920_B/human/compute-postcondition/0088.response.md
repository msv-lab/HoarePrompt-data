The code snippet `sum1 = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `sum1`. Since `sum1` was already defined in the initial state as the sum of all elements in the list `a`, this operation does not change the value of `sum1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop, `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop, the input integer must be greater than 1.**
