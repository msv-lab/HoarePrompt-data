Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing three elements (the original element, `sums`, and the updated `sums` value), `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again. If `i == 0`, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.***
