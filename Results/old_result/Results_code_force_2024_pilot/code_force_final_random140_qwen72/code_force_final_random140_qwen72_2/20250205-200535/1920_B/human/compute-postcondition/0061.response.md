Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
