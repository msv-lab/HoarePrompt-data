Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input (each greater than 0), `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 0, and `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. Additionally, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i == 0`, `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i == 0`, `ans` also contains the value `sums`, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`. If `i != 0`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
