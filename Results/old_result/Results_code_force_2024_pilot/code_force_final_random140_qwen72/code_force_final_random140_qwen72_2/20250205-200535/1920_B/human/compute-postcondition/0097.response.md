Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, the input integer must be greater than 1, `i` is not 0, and the condition `(i + x - 1 < n)` is true.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `sums`.
