Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop. The variable `i` has been incremented through the loop from 0 to `k`, and `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `k + 1` times, as specified by the range `range(k + 1)`.
- During each iteration, the variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `k`.
- The list `ans` grows with each iteration, eventually containing `k + 1` elements.
- The variable `sums` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, and its final value after the loop completes is stored in the last element of `ans`.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`) remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
