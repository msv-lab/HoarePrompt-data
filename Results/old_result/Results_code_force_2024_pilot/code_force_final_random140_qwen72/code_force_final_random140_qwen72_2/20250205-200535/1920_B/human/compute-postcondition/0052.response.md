Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
