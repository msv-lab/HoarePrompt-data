Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop, `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop, the input integer must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, `sums`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that the input integer must be greater than 1 is still valid.
