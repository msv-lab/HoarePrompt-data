The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies the list `ans` by appending the value of `sums` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
