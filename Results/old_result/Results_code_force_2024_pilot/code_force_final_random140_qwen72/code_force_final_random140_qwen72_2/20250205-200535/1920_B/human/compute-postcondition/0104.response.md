Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing a single value which is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums` if `i` is not 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, the input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is 3**

Explanation:
- The code `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` updates the value of `sums`.
- The value of `sums` is now calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `ans` remains the same, but since `i` is 3, `ans` will contain the value of `sums`.
- The initial state conditions for `n`, `k`, `x`, and the input integer being greater than 1 are still valid.
