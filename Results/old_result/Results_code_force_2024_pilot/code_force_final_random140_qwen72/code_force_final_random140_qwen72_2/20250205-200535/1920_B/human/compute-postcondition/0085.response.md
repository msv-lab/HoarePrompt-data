Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop, `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop, the input integer must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` was previously a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input. After executing the given code, `a` is now a list of integers read from the new input.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `sums` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.
- The precondition that the input integer must be greater than 1 remains valid.
