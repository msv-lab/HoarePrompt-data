The code `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sums + a[i - 1]`, the value of `sums` before the append operation is the sum of all elements in the list `a` up to the index `i - 1`.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`, `sums` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` up to the index `i - 1`, the input integer must be greater than 1, `i` is not 0, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
