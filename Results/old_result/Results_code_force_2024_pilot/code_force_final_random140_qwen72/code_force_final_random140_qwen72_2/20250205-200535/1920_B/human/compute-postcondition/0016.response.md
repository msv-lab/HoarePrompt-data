Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `(i + x - 1)` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `sums` is the original value of `sums` plus the value at index `i - 1` in the list `a`.
