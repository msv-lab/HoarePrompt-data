The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is not equal to 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
