Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, representing the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all iterations, `_` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For subsequent elements, if `i + x - 1 < n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop. The variable `i` has been incremented through the loop from 0 to `k`, and `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1), `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 0), `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values where each value is calculated based on the loop conditions: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and subsequent values are updated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`. `sums` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop, which is the last element in the list `ans`. The input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is `k + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
