To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` remains 0 (not used in the context of the problem).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **First Element of `ans`:**
   - The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
   - This means the first element is the total sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of `a`.

2. **Subsequent Elements of `ans`:**
   - For each subsequent element in `ans` (from the second element onwards):
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Explanation:
- The list `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, where each element is calculated based on the conditions described.
- The `max(ans)` function will find the maximum value among these `k + 1` elements.

### Final Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, each representing the value of sums at each iteration of the loop, with the first element being sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]), and subsequent elements calculated based on the conditions provided)**
