Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 0, and `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. Additionally, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.***
