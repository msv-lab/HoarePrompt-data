The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. This does not affect the values of `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `sum1`. The only change is the creation of the new variable `ans` which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input (each greater than 0), `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list.**
