The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This overrides the initial values of `n` and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `_` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input (initially)
- `k` is the second integer from the input (initially)

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `k` are reassigned to the new values read from the input.

The specific condition for `k` (whether it is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is odd) is not affected by this code snippet, as it only reassigns the values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input.**
