To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the new input.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds up the result of the division to the nearest integer.
   - Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` will be a floating-point number.
   - The `ceil` function will round this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Given the initial state, the value of `k` is not explicitly provided, but it is an integer. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `k`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where k is the second integer from the new input)**
