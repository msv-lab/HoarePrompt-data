Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2, representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `k` is the second integer from the input. If `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is odd, then the specific condition for `k` is met. Otherwise, `k` is either odd or `k // 2` is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part, but since both parts do not alter the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, or `k`, these values remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
