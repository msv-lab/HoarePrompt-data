Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part, but since both parts do not alter the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, or `k`, these values remain unchanged.***
