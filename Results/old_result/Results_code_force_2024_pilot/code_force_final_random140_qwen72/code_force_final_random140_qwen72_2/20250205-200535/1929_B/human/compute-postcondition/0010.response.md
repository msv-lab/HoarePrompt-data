Initial State: 
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Explanation:
- The code snippet prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.
- `k` is an integer that is part of the input.
- The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` gives the final value that is printed.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the second integer from the new input)**
