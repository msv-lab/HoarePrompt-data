Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is odd.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `k`**:
   - `k` is an even number.
   - When `k` is divided by 2, the result is an odd number.
   - Let's denote the result of `k // 2` as `m`. According to the problem, `m` is an odd number.
   - Therefore, `k` can be expressed as \( k = 2m \), where \( m \) is an odd number.

2. **Expression `k // 2 + 1`**:
   - Since `k` is \( 2m \), `k // 2` will be \( m \).
   - Adding 1 to `m` gives \( m + 1 \).

3. **Result**:
   - Since `m` is an odd number, \( m + 1 \) will be an even number.

### Conclusion:
The expression `k // 2 + 1` will evaluate to an even number, specifically the next even number after the odd number `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **an even number (where the even number is the result of \( k // 2 + 1 \))**
