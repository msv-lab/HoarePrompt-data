To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - Either `k` is odd or `k // 2` is even.

2. **Understanding the Condition:**
   - If `k` is odd, then `k / 2` will be a non-integer (a floating-point number with a .5 decimal part).
   - If `k` is even, then `k // 2` will be an integer, and since it is specified that `k // 2` is even, `k` must be a multiple of 4 (i.e., `k` is divisible by 4).

3. **Calculation:**
   - The `ceil(k / 2)` function will round up the result of `k / 2` to the nearest integer.
   - If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a number ending in .5, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round this up to the next integer.
   - If `k` is even and a multiple of 4, `k / 2` will be an integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will be the same integer.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a number like 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, etc., and `ceil(k / 2)` will be 2, 3, 4, etc.
   - If `k` is even and a multiple of 4, `k / 2` will be a number like 2, 4, 6, etc., and `ceil(k / 2)` will be 2, 4, 6, etc.

Given the conditions, the output will be the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where k is the second integer from the input and either k is odd or k // 2 is even)**
