Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively. The function then calculates and prints a value for each test case: if `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
