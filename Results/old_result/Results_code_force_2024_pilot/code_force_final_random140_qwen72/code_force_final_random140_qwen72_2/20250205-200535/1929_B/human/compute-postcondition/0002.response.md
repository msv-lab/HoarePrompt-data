The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, converting both to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `_` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input
- `k` is assigned the second integer from the input

The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
