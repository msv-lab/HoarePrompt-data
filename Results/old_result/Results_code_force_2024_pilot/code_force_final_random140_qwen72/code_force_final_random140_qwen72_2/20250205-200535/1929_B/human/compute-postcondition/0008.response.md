The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the loop control variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `k` is the second integer from the input. If `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is odd, then the specific condition for `k` is met. Otherwise, `k` is either odd or `k // 2` is even.**
