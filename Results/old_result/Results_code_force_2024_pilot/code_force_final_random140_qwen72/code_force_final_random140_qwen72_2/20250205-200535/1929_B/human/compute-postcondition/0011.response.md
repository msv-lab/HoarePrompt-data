Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t`: An integer input where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `_`: A variable set to 1. This variable is also not directly used in the print statement.
   - `n`: The first integer from the new input. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `k`: The second integer from the new input. This variable is used in the print statement.

2. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `ceil(k / 2)`.
   - `k / 2` divides the value of `k` by 2.
   - `ceil(k / 2)` takes the ceiling of the result of `k / 2`, which means it rounds up to the nearest integer.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` will be a floating-point number.
   - The `ceil` function will round this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

### Final Output:
The code will print the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where k is the second integer from the new input)**

This means the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.
