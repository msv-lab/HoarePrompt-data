The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (n, k) and their constraints are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0**
