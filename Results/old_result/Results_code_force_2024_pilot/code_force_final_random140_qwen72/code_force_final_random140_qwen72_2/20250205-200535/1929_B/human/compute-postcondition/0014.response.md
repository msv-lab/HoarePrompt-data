The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the new input. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input.**
