You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively. The function then calculates and prints a value for each test case: if `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color does not account for the structure of the diagonals in the grid.

Consider the following test case:
- \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \).

According to the problem, a 3x3 grid has 10 diagonals. To cover 9 out of these 10 diagonals, we need to color at least 5 cells. However, the provided program outputs 5, which is correct for this specific case. But let's consider another case:

- \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \).

A 4x4 grid has 14 diagonals. To cover 7 out of these 14 diagonals, the minimum number of cells to color is 4. However, the provided program outputs 4, which is correct for this specific case.

However, the program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the general case. For example, consider:

- \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 10 \).

A 5x5 grid has 18 diagonals. To cover 10 out of these 18 diagonals, the minimum number of cells to color is 5. However, the provided program outputs 5, which is correct for this specific case.

But consider:

- \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 12 \).

A 6x6 grid has 22 diagonals. To cover 12 out of these 22 diagonals, the minimum number of cells to color is 6. However, the provided program outputs 6, which is correct for this specific case.

The issue arises when \( k \) is close to \( 4n - 2 \). The program's logic does not correctly handle the distribution of cells across the diagonals. For example, when \( k \) is large, the program might not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells needed to cover the required number of diagonals.

To correctly solve this problem, a more detailed approach is needed to ensure that the minimum number of cells is correctly calculated for all possible values of \( n \) and \( k \). The current logic is too simplistic and does not account for the complex distribution of cells across the diagonals.
