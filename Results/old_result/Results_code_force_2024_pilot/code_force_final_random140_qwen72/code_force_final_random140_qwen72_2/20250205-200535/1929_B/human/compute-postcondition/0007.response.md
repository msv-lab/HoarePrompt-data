Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `k` is the second integer from the input. If `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is odd, then the specific condition for `k` is met. Otherwise, `k` is either odd or `k // 2` is even.***
