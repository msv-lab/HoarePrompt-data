Postcondition: ***`idx` is 2, `arrs` has at least three elements, and `cnt1` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` was 1 and the second element is not 1. If the second element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt1` is 2. If `arrs[2]` (the third element) is 1, `cnt1` is incremented by 1, making it 2 if the first element was 1 and the second was not 1, or 3 if the second element was 1.***
