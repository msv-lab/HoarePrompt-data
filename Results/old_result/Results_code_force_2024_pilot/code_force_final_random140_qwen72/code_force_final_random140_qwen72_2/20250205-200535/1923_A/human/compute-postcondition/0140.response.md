Postcondition: ***`arrs` must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, and `arrs[0]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 2. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, and `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 2. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, and `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is not 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt0` remains unchanged.***
