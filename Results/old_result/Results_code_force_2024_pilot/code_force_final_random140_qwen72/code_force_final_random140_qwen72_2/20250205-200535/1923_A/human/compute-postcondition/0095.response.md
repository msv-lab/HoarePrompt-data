Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt1` is 2, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1, `ans` is set based on the conditions involving `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `_` is incremented by the number of times the conditions for incrementing `_` were met during the loop. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs`, `cnt1` remains 0, and `ans` is set based on the conditions involving `cnt0` and `cnt1`.***
