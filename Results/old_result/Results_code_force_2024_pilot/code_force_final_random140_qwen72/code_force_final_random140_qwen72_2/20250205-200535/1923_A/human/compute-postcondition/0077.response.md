Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the first element of `arrs` was 0, `cnt1` is the count of ones in the new `arrs`, `ans` is set based on the conditions involving `cnt0` and `cnt1`, `_` is incremented under certain conditions. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is incremented by 1.***
