Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the code seems to be counting the number of zeros in the array, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips (1s) without any free cells (0s) between them.

The correct approach involves finding the optimal position to gather all chips, which typically would involve calculating the cost of moving all chips to each possible position and choosing the position with the minimum total cost. The current implementation does not reflect this logic and thus is incorrect.
