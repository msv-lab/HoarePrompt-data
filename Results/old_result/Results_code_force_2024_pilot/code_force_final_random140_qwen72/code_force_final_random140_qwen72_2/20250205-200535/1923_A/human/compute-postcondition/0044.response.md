Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least `len(arrs)` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (or excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `arrs`.
- For each element, if it is 1, `cnt1` is incremented.
- After the loop completes, `idx` will be `len(arrs) - 1` because the loop index starts at 0 and increments up to `len(arrs) - 1`.
- `cnt1` will be the total count of 1s in the `arrs` list.
- `cnt0` remains the count of zeros in `arrs` (or excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), as it is not modified within the loop.
