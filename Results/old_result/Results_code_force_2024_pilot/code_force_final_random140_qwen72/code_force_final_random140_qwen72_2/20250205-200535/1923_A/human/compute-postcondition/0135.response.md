The only objects in the loop head are the variable `idx` and the list `arrs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arrs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arrs` must have at least 3 elements, and `idx` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

At the end of the last iteration, `arrs` must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `arrs` must have at least 3 elements, and `idx` will be 2.

State: **`arrs` must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt0` remains unchanged. If `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains unchanged.**
