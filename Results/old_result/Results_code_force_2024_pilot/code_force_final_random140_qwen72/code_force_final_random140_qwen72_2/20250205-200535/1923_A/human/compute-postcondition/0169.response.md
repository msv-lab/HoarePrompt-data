The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of cells on the ribbon.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell containing a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the configuration of the ribbon (list `a`). However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information. Given the context, a reasonable assumption is that the function might return some form of analysis or computation based on the positions of the chips on the ribbon.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of cells on the ribbon), and `a` (a list of integers representing the state of each cell on the ribbon). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the configuration of the ribbon.**
