The only objects in the loop head are the variables `idx` and the list `arrs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arrs`. If `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 0, `arrs` has at least one element, and `cnt1` is 0 unless the first element of `arrs` is 1, in which case `cnt1` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The list `arrs` must still have at least one element, but since `idx` is now 1, `arrs` must have at least two elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`idx` is 1, `arrs` has at least two elements, and `cnt1` is 0 unless the first element of `arrs` is 1, in which case `cnt1` is 1**
