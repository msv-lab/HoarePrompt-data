The code snippet `cnt1 += 1` increments the value of `cnt1` by 1. To determine the new value of `cnt1`, we need to consider its initial value based on the conditions provided in the initial state.

- If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is initially 2 if `arrs[0]` is 1, or 1 if `arrs[0]` is 0.
- If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt1` remains 0.

Given that `idx` is 2, we need to check the value of `arrs[2]` to determine the initial value of `cnt1`.

### Case 1: `arrs[2]` is 1
- If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt1` is initially 2.
  - After `cnt1 += 1`, `cnt1` becomes 3.
- If `arrs[0]` is 0, then `cnt1` is initially 1.
  - After `cnt1 += 1`, `cnt1` becomes 2.

### Case 2: `arrs[2]` is 0
- `cnt1` remains 0.
  - After `cnt1 += 1`, `cnt1` becomes 1.

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `arrs[2]` and `arrs[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (or excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0). If `arrs[2]` is 1, then `cnt1` is 3 if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 2. If `arrs[2]` is 0, `cnt1` is 1.**
