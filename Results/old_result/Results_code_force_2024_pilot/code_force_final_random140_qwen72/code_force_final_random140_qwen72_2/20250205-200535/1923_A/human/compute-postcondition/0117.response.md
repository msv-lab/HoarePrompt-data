Postcondition: **`arrs` must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, and the first element of `arrs` is 0, but `idx` is not 0.** 

Note: The condition `idx != 0` contradicts the precondition that `idx` is 0. Therefore, the if condition cannot be true given the precondition. However, for the sake of the exercise, the postcondition includes all the conditions as specified.
