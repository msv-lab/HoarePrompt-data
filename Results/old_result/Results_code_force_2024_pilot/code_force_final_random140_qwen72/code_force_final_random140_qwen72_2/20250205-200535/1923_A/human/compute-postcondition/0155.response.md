Output State: **`idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `arrs` has at least as many elements as its length, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the index `idx` will be at the last valid index of the array `arrs`, which is `len(arrs) - 1`. The variable `cnt1` will have counted the number of 1s in the entire array `arrs`, as the loop increments `cnt1` each time it encounters a 1 in `arrs`. The other variables mentioned in the initial state (`cnt0`, `ans`, and `_`) are not modified within the loop, so their final values remain as described in the initial state.
