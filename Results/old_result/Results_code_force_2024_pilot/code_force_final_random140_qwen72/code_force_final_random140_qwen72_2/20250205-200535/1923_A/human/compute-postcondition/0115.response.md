Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 0 or not 0, `ans` is 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is the value of `cnt0`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**
