You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip. For each iteration, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` minus 1 if the first and last elements of `arrs` are 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`. The loop will have executed `t` times, and the final output will be the value of `ans` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` indicating the number of cells on a ribbon, followed by a list of `n` integers (0s and 1s) representing the state of each cell. The function calculates the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the chips (1s) so that all 1s are grouped together, with all 0s either before or after them. The result for each test case is printed to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the chips are already in a single block but are not at the beginning of the ribbon. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
0 0 1 1 1
```

The output should be `2` because we need to move the first two chips to the left to form a single block without any free cells between them. However, the current program will output `0` because it incorrectly assumes that the number of zeros between the first and last chip is the answer, which is not always true. The program needs to account for the position of the chips and calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together in a contiguous block.
