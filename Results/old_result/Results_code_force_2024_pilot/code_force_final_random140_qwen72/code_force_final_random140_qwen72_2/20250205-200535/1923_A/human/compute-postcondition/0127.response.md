Postcondition: ***`arrs` must have at least 1 element, and `idx` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0 (which is impossible given the precondition that `idx` is 0), `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If neither of these conditions is met, `arrs[0]` remains 1 and `cnt0` is unchanged.***
