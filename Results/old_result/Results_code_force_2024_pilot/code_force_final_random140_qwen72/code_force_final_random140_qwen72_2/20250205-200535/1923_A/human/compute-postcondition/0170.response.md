Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` indicating the number of cells on a ribbon, followed by a list of `n` integers (0s and 1s) representing the state of each cell. The function calculates the minimum number of moves required to rearrange the chips (1s) so that all 1s are grouped together, with all 0s either before or after them. The result for each test case is printed to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
