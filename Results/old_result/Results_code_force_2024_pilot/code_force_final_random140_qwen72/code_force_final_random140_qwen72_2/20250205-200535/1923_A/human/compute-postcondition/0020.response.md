Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `cnt0` is 0, `idx` is 1. If the second element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1 and the second element of `arrs` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0 and the second element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1 depending on its original value.***
