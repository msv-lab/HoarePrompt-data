Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 1, `cnt1` is the count of ones in the new `arrs`, the first element of `arrs` is 1, if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0, otherwise, if `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `cnt0` is now 1.
