Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is the count of ones in the new `arrs`, if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decremented by 1, if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0, otherwise, if `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`, `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt1` is the count of ones in the new `arrs`. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is set to 1, and if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decremented by 1. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`. `_` is incremented by 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` is 0, and if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0; otherwise, if `cnt1` is greater than 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0 if the first element of `arrs` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element of `arrs` is 0, and if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is 2 if the second element of `arrs` is 0. `cnt1` is the count of ones in the new `arrs`, `ans` is set based on the conditions involving `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `_` is incremented under certain conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial conditions. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is incremented by 1 (so it becomes 1, 2, or 3). If `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is also incremented by 1. `cnt1` remains the count of ones in the new `arrs`, `ans` is set based on the conditions involving `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `_` is incremented under certain conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
