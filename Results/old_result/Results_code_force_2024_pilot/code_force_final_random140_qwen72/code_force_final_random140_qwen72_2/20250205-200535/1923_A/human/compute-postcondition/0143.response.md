Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `idx` will be equal to `len(arrs) - 1`. If `arrs[0]` is 0, `cnt0` will be the count of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. If `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt0` will be the count of zeros in `arrs`. The value of `ans` will be 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, otherwise, it will be the value of `cnt0`. The variable `_` will be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `t` for the loop to potentially execute again.**

Explanation:
- `idx` will be `len(arrs) - 1` because the loop iterates over all indices of `arrs`.
- `cnt0` will count the number of zeros in `arrs` starting from the second element if `arrs[0]` is 0, or from the first element if `arrs[0]` is 1.
- `ans` will be determined based on the value of `cnt1` as described in the initial state.
- The loop control variable `_` will be incremented by 1, but its value must still be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
