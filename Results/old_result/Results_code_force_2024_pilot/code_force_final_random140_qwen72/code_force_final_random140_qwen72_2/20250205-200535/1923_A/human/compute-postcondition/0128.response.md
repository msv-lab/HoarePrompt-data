The only objects in the loop head are the variable `idx` and the list `arrs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arrs`. If `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arrs` must have at least 1 element, and `idx` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be incremented by 1, and `arrs` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`arrs` must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1**
