Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (or excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0). If `arrs[idx]` is 1, then `cnt1` is 2 if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt1` remains 0.***
