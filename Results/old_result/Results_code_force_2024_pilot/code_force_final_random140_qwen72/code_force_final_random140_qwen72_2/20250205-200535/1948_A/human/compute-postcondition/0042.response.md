Output State: **`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, the console screen is cleared, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user.
- The values of `s`, `t`, `i`, and the state of the console screen remain unchanged.
- Since the code snippet only includes the assignment of `n`, no further changes to other variables or conditions are applied at this point.
