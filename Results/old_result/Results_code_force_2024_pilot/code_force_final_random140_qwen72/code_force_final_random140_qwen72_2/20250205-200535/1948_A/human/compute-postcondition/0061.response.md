Functionality: ** The function `func()` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it generates a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating each of the first `(n // 2)` characters of the uppercase alphabet twice and prints "YES" followed by the generated string. The function clears the console screen before processing the test cases. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value. **
