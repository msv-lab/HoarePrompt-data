Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1, `res` is 'AAA' if `n` >= 2, otherwise `res` is 'AA'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1.
- The value of `letter` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `res` is updated by appending the character at index `i % 26` from `letter` to the existing value of `res`.
  - Since `i` is 1, `i % 26` is 1.
  - The character at index 1 in `letter` is 'B'.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the initial value of `res` is 'AA', so `res` becomes 'AAA'.
  - If `n` is less than 2, the initial value of `res` is 'A', so `res` becomes 'AB'. However, since `n` is given to be greater than 1, this case does not apply.
