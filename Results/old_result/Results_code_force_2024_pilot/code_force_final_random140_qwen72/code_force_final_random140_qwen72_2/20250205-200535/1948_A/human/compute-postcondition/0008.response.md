The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Given the constraint that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, the function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, based on the given context, we can infer that the function might perform some operation or return a value related to `t`, but without further details on the output, we cannot specify what exactly it returns.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is expected to operate under the condition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 50, inclusive, but the specific output or return value is not defined in the provided information.**
