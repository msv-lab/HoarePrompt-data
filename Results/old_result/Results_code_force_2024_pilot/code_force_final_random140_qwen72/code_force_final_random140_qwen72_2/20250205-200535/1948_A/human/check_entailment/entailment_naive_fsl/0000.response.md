Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case when `n = 1`. According to the problem description, if `n = 1`, the output should be `NO` because it is impossible to construct a string where exactly one character is special (a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors). However, the current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly prints `YES` and attempts to construct a string, which is not valid according to the problem description.

Example Input:
```
1
1
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
A
```

This clearly shows that the program does not meet the requirements for the case when `n = 1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
