Postcondition: ***`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, the console screen is cleared, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, there are no additional changes. If `n` is even, `ans` is the string formed by repeating each character from the start of `s` twice up to the (n // 2)th character, `x` is n // 2, and `j` is n // 2 - 1.***
