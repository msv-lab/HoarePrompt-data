The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0** (Note: The actual value of `t` will be decremented by 1, but the condition for the loop to execute again is that `t` must be greater than 0.)
