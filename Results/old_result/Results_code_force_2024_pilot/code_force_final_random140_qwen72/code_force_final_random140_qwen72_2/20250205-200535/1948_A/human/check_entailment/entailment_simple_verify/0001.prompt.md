You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

Otherwise, `n` is greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is the smallest integer such that `i` = `initial_n` / 2 (rounded up), and `res` is a string where each character from 'A' onwards is repeated twice until the total length of the string equals `initial_n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `initial_n` is odd.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should be of length at most 200.
   - If no such string exists, we should output "NO".

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` from input.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have a special character if `n` is 1 or 0.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".
   - It then constructs a string `res` by appending pairs of the same character (from the alphabet) until `n` is reduced to 0.
   - The loop ensures that the string is constructed using different letters from the alphabet to avoid creating more than one special character per pair.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to handle the input and output for that specific `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the function correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have a single special character.
   - For `n = 2`, the function outputs "YES" followed by a string like "AA" which has exactly 2 special characters.
   - For larger values of `n`, the function continues to construct the string by adding pairs of the same character, ensuring that the number of special characters matches `n`.

5. **String Length**:
   - The maximum length of the string generated by the function is `2 * n` because it adds pairs of characters.
   - Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of the string is `100`, which is within the limit of 200.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and generates the required string for valid inputs. The logic is sound and the constraints are respected.

### Correctness:
**True**
