You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are required for this function. The function reads an integer n from the standard input, where 1 <= n <= 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is the smallest integer such that `i` = `initial_n` / 2 (rounded up), `res` is a string where each character from 'A' onwards is repeated twice until the total length of the string equals `initial_n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `initial_n` is odd.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: (an empty string)
    #State: *No input parameters are required for this function. The variable `n` is an integer read from the standard input, where 1 <= n <= 50. If `n` is 1 or less, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is the smallest integer such that `i` = `initial_n` / 2 (rounded up), and `res` is a string where each character from 'A' onwards is repeated twice until the total length of the string equals `initial_n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `initial_n` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, where `1 <= n <= 50`, and returns a value based on the input `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
