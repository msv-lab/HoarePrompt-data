The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by appending twice the character at index `x` of the string `s`. Given that `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `x` is 2, and `ans` is initially 'AABB', the character at index 2 of `s` is 'C'. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AABBCC'.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, the console screen is cleared, `n` must be at least 5, `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**
