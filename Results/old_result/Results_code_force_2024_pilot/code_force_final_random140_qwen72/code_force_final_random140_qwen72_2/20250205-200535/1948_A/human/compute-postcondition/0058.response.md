Postcondition: ***`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, the console screen is cleared, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, there are no changes to the variables. If `n` is even and at least 2, `ans` is the first `(n // 2)` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, `x` is `(n // 2)`, and `j` is `(n // 2) - 1`.***
