Output State: **`t` is 0 or greater, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the input integer.
- After each iteration, `func_1()` is called.
- By the time the loop finishes, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as there is no code modifying `t` within the loop body.
- Therefore, the final output state is that `t` is still 0 or greater (as it was initially), and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
