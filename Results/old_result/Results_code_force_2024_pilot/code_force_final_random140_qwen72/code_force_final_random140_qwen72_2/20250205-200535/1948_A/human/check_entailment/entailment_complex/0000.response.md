Reasoning:  
- The program correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually.
- For each test case, the program checks if `n` is 1 or less. If so, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have a special character under the given conditions when `n` is 1 or less.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the program prints "YES" and attempts to construct a string that meets the criteria. It does this by repeating each character from 'A' onwards twice until the total length of the string equals `n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `n` is odd.
- The logic for constructing the string ensures that each character is repeated twice, which means every character (except possibly the last one) will be equal to one of its neighbors, satisfying the condition for a special character.
- The program ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is within the constraints mentioned in the problem statement.
- The program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
