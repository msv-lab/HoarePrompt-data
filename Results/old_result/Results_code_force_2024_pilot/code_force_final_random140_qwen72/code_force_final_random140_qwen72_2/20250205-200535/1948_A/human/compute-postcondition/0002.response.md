The function `func_1()` is called, but there is no information about what `func_1()` does or any changes it might make to the variables. Since the initial state only specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and there are no other variables or operations that modify `t` or introduce new variables, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
