The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function should output a suitable string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, or "NO" if no such string exists.
