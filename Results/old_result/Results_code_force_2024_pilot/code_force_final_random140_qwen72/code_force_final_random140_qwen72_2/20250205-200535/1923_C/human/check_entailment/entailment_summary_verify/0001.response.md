### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays:**
   - `ones` is used to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 up to each index.
   - `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum of elements up to each index.
   - These arrays are correctly populated in the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
         sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
     ```

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot be good (it cannot satisfy condition 2).
   - For other cases, it calculates the number of ones in the subarray and the sum of the subarray using the auxiliary arrays:
     ```python
     onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
     sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
     ```
   - It then checks the condition:
     ```python
     if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
         print('YES')
     else:
         print('NO')
     ```

4. **Condition Explanation:**
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a good array.
   - This condition is derived from the fact that we need to change each element in the subarray to a different positive integer while maintaining the same sum. The minimum sum we can achieve by changing all elements to 1 (except those already 1) is `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
