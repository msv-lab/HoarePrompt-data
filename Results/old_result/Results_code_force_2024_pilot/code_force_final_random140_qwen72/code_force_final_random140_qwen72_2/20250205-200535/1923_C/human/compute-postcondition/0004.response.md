To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

Here, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, which means the loop will run `n` times if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will take values from 1 to `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop itself and will start at 1.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be 1 (this is set by the loop).
- `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
