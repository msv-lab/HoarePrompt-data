Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The value of `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- The values of `q`, `_`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition that if `l` is equal to `r`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop is still valid.
