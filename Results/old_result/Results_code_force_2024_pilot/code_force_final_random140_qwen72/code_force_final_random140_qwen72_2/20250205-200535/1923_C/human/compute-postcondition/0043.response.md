The code snippet `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]` updates the value of `sumInRange` based on the values of `sum[r]` and `sum[l - 1]`.

- `sumInRange` is updated to the value of `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- All other variables (`q`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is evaluated. If this condition is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition is greater than `sumInRange`.**
