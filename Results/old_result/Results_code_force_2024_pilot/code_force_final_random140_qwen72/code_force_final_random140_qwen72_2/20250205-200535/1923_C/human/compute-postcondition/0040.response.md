The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables `q`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, or `sumInRange`. However, the control flow is affected, and the loop will proceed to the next iteration without executing any subsequent code within the same iteration.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
