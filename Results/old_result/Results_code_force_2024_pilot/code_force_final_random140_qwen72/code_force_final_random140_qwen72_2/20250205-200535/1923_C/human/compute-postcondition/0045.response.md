To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is evaluated.
   - If this condition is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true.
   - Otherwise, the condition is greater than `sumInRange`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will only execute if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true. If this condition is false, the print statement will not execute.

However, the problem does not specify the exact values of `l`, `r`, `ones`, and `sum`, so we cannot definitively determine whether the condition will be true or false. Therefore, the output of the print statement depends on the specific values of these variables.

Since the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact outcome of the condition, we can only state that if the condition is met, the print statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES (if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true)**
