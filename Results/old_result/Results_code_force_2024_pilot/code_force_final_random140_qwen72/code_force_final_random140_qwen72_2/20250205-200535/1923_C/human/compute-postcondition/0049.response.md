The function `func_1` is described with certain constraints but lacks explicit parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context and the constraints given, it can be inferred that the function likely processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a series of queries on segments of this list. Here's the inferred functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` representing the size of a list `c` of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided, indicating a segment of the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i`. The function processes these queries and returns results based on the operations performed on the specified segments of the list `c`.**
