Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `q-1`, `l` and `r` are the last set of input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop would have printed 'NO' and continued to the next iteration. If `l` is not equal to `r`, the loop would have evaluated the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` and printed 'YES' if it is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, otherwise it would have printed 'NO'. The loop has completed all `q` iterations.**
