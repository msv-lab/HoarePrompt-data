### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays:**
   - `ones` is used to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 up to each index.
   - `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum of elements up to each index.
   - These arrays are correctly populated in the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
         sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
     ```

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot be good (it cannot satisfy condition 2).
   - For other cases, it calculates the number of ones in the subarray and the sum of the subarray using the auxiliary arrays:
     ```python
     onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
     sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
     ```
   - It then checks the condition:
     ```python
     if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
         print('YES')
     else:
         print('NO')
     ```

4. **Condition Explanation:**
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a good array.
   - This condition is derived from the fact that we need to change each element in the subarray to a different positive integer while maintaining the same sum. The minimum sum we can achieve by changing all elements to 1 (except those already 1) is `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange`.

### Verification Using Annotations:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers where \(1 \le n, q \le 3 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `c` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \le c_i \le 10^9\).
  - For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where \(1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n\).

- **After Reading Input:**
  - `n` and `q` are correctly read.
  - `nums` is correctly read as a list of integers.
  - `ones` and `sum` are initialized correctly.

- **After Populating Auxiliary Arrays:**
  - `ones` and `sum` are correctly populated with cumulative counts and sums, respectively.

- **During Query Handling:**
  - For each query, `l` and `r` are correctly read.
  - If `l == r`, the program correctly prints "NO".
  - For other cases, the program correctly calculates `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.
  - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is correctly checked and the appropriate response is printed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state and performs the necessary calculations accurately.

Final: **True**
