The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of control within a loop.

Given the initial state:
- `q` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `l` and `r` are input integers, and `l` is equal to `r`.

The `continue` statement does not alter these conditions. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional note that the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop (if inside a loop).

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` and `r` are input integers, and `l` is equal to `r`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
