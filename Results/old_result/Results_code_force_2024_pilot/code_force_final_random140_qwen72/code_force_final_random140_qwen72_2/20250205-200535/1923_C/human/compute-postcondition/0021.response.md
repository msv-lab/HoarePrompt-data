The code snippet assigns the difference between `sum[r]` and `sum[l - 1]` to the variable `sumInRange`. The values of `q`, `_`, `l`, `r`, and `onesInRange` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
