To determine what will be printed when the `print('NO')` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is evaluated.
   - If this condition is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true.
   - Otherwise, the condition is greater than `sumInRange`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print('NO')` statement.

Given the conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, and `sumInRange`. The conditions described do not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly; they only control the flow of the loop.

Therefore, the output of the `print('NO')` statement is:

Output: **NO**
