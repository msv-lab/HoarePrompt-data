Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `q` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `l` and `r` are input integers.
- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement directly. They only influence whether this line of code is reached or not. Since the problem does not specify any branching logic that would prevent this `print` statement from executing, we can assume it will execute under the given conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
