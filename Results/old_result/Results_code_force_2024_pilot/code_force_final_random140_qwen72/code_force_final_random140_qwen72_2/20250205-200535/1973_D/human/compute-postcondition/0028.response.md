The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `k` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
