The function `func_2(-1)` is called. Since the function call does not modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is 0, `p` is the final value after all iterations of the inner loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.**
