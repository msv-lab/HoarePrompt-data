Output State: **After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` is 0, `max_val` is 0, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `m` is 0, `j` is `k`, `p` is the final value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, unless `p` became greater than or equal to `n` during any iteration, in which case `p` is set to 0 and the loop breaks early. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The loop iterates from `n // k` down to 1. After the loop completes, `i` will be 0 because it is decremented until it reaches 0.
- **`max_val`**: Since the condition `r <= n` is never met (as per the given information), `max_val` remains 0.
- **`n` and `k`**: These values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
- **`m`**: `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`. Since `max_val` is 0, `m` will also be 0.
- **`j`**: The inner loop runs from 1 to `k`, so `j` will be `k` after the last iteration.
- **`p`**: `p` is updated within the inner loop using `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` during any iteration, it is reset to 0 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `p` will be the final value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n` at the end of the loop.
