Postcondition: **After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` remains `n // k - 2`, `n // k` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `m` is still `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `p` is the final value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, unless `p` became greater than or equal to `n` during any iteration, in which case `p` is set to 0 and the loop breaks early. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**
