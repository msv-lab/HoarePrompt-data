To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the current state:

### Current State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n // k - 1`.
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0).
- `m` is `i * max_val`.
- `p` is the final value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes.
- `j` is `k`.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
- `p` is not equal to `n`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from `n // k` down to 1 (inclusive).
- The loop condition is that `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n // k - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `n // k - 2`.

### New State:
- `i` is now `n // k - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**
