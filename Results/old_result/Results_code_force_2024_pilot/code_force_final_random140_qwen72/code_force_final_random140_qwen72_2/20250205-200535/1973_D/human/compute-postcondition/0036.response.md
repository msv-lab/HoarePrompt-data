Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n` before `j` reaches `k`, the loop breaks early.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = k`.
- In each iteration, `p` is updated to `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
- If at any point `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, the loop breaks.
- After the loop completes (either because `j` reaches `k` or `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`), `p` will hold its final value.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
