Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n`.**
