The value of `m` is calculated as the product of `i` and `max_val`. Given that `i` is `n // k` and `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (or 0 if no such \(i\) exists), the value of `m` will be `i * max_val`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`.**
