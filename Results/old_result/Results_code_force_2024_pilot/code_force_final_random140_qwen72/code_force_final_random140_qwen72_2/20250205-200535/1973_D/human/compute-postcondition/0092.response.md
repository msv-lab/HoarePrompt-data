Output State: **`i` is 0, `max_val` is 0, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `m` is 0, `j` is `k`, `p` is the final value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, unless `p` became greater than or equal to `n` during any iteration, in which case `p` is set to 0 and the loop breaks early. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`. The function `func_2(-1)` has been called, and its return value (if any) is not specified.**
