To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k - 2`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `j` is 2
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`
- If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `p`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `k` (inclusive).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
4. **Range Check**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `p`.**
