The function `func_3` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided snippet, but based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are positive integers and 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. However, all cases described indicate that the function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k` within the specified range but does not return any value regardless of the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both are positive integers and 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, but does not return any value.**
