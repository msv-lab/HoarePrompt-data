To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`. If no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(n // k, 0, -1)` is non-empty. This means `n // k` must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0 (this is the initial value of `i` before the loop starts, but it will be redefined by the loop).
   - `n` is a positive integer within the specified range.
   - `k` is a positive integer within the specified range.
   - `max_val` is defined based on the function `func_1`.

2. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n // k` must be greater than 0. This ensures that the range `range(n // k, 0, -1)` is non-empty.
   - The initial value of `i` inside the loop will be `n // k`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` will be set to `n // k` by the loop.
- `max_val` remains as defined (it is not directly involved in the loop head).

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute if `n // k` is greater than 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure this condition is met.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)**.
