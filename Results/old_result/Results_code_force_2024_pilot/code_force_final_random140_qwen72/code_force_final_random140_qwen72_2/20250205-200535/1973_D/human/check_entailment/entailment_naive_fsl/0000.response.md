Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `k = 1` correctly. According to the problem description, when `k = 1`, the value of `m` is always equal to `f(1, n)`. However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not directly handle this special case.

Here's a specific example where the program fails:
- Suppose `n = 5` and `k = 1`.
- The hidden array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

In this case, the correct value of `m` should be `f(1, 5) = 5 * 5 = 25`. However, the program does not directly compute this value and instead tries to find a value of `m` by iterating through possible values, which may not yield the correct result.

To fix this, the program should include a special case for `k = 1` where it directly computes `f(1, n)` and outputs that as the answer.
