Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: If the condition `r <= n` is met during any iteration, `max_val` will be set to the value of `i` at that point, and the loop will terminate. Otherwise, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, `max_val` will remain 0, and `r` will be the last computed value from `func_1(1, 1 * n)`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    m = i * max_val
    p = 0
    for j in range(1, k + 1):
        if p >= n:
            p = 0
            break
        p = func_1(p + 1, m)
    if p == n:
        func_2(m)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n // k`, `n // k` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `m` is `(n // k) * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` was less than `n` for each iteration, otherwise `p` is 0 and the loop breaks out. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n // k - 1`, `n // k` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and `p` is less than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` remains `n // k - 2`, `n // k` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `m` is still `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `p` is the final value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, unless `p` became greater than or equal to `n` during any iteration, in which case `p` is set to 0 and the loop breaks early. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
