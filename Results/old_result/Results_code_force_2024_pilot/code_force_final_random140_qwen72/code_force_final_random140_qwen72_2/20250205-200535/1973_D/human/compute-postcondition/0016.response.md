Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, `max_val` is `n - 2`, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, and `r` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is within.
