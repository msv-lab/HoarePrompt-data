Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `m = i * max_val` assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`.
- The value of `m` is updated to `i * max_val`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `p`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and relationships between the variables specified in the initial state are still valid.
