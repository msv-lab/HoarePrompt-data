Functionality: ** The function `func_3` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). It then attempts to find a specific value `m` such that a series of calls to `func_1` results in a value `p` that equals `n`. If such a value `m` is found, it calls `func_2(m)`. If no such value is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`. The function does not return any value. **
