The provided code snippet calls a function named `func_3()`. Since there's no definition or side effects of `func_3()` given in the context, we cannot determine what changes it might make to the program state. However, the initial state specifies that `t` is defined as `t - 2` and must be greater than 0. This implies that `t` was initially some value greater than 2, and after the operation, it is now 2 less than its original value but still greater than 0.

Since the call to `func_3()` does not provide any additional information about changes to `t` or any other variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state regarding `t`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and must be greater than 0.**
