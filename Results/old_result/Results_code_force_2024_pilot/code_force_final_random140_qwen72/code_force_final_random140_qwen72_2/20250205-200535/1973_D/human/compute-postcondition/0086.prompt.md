You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        
        if r <= n:
            assert r == n
            max_val = i
            break
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, and `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`. If no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0.
    for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
        m = i * max_val
        
        p = 0
        
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            p = func_1(p + 1, m)
            if p >= n:
                break
        
        if p == n:
            func_2(m)
            return
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `0 * max_val` (which is 0), `p` is the final value after all iterations of the inner loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
    func_2(-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both are positive integers and 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, but does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value as the return statement is empty.

Case_2: The program does not return any value as the return statement is empty.

Case_3: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
