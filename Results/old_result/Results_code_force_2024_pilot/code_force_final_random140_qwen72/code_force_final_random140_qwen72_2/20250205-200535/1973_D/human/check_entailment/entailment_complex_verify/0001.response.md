### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `m`.
   - We can make up to `2n` queries to determine the smallest `r` for a given `l` and `x`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function makes a query to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`. It prints the query and reads the response.
   - **func_2:** This function prints the final answer `m` and reads the response to check if it is correct.
   - **func_3:** This function handles the logic for a single test case.
     - It initializes `max_val` to 0 and iterates from `n` down to 1 to find the maximum possible value of `i` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` and `r <= n`.
     - Once `max_val` is found, it iterates from `n // k` down to 1 to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.
     - If such an `m` is found, it prints the answer using `func_2`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - **func_4:** This function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_3` for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Query Handling:** `func_1` and `func_2` handle the interaction correctly by flushing the output and reading the response.
   - **Logic for Single Test Case:**
     - The initial loop in `func_3` to find `max_val` is correct. It ensures that `max_val` is the largest possible value such that `f(1, r) = max_val * n` and `r <= n`.
     - The subsequent loop to find the largest `m` is also correct. It checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m` and prints the answer accordingly.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:** `func_4` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_3` for each.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Edge Cases:** The program should handle edge cases such as when `k = 1` or when the array is very small.
   - **Efficiency:** The program should ensure that it does not exceed the query limit of `2n`.

5. **Annotated Code Review:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly handles the interaction and the logic for finding the largest `m`.
   - The assertions in the code help ensure that the program behaves as expected during the queries and responses.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The interaction with the judge is handled properly, and the logic for finding the largest `m` is sound.

Final: **True**
