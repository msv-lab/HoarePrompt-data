To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `j` and `k`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k - 2`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is 0
- `j` is `k`
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
```
For the loop to execute, the range `range(1, k + 1)` must contain at least one value. This means `k` must be at least 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `j` should start at 1.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the initial state, `k` is already greater than or equal to 1, so no adjustment is needed for `k`. However, `j` needs to be set to 1 for the loop to start correctly.

### Final State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k - 2`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`**
