Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`max_val`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: After each iteration, `p` is updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The loop continues until either `j` reaches `k` or `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `k` because the loop iterates from 1 to `k` inclusive.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **Condition for breaking the loop**: The loop will break if `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` at any point during the iterations. If the loop completes without breaking, `p` will be the final value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration.
