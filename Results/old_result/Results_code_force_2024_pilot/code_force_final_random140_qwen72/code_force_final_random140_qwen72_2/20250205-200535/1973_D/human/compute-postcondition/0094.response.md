Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes no explicit parameters but reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`. It performs a series of computations involving calls to `func_1` and potentially `func_2`. The primary goal is to find a specific value `m` based on the conditions within nested loops. If a certain condition (`p == n`) is met, it calls `func_2(m)` and terminates. If the condition is never met, it calls `func_2(-1)` before ending. The function does not return any value. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the execution. **
