Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `0 * max_val` (which is 0), `p` is the final value after all iterations of the inner loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The variable `i` has been decremented from its initial value of `n // k` down to 0, as the loop iterates backwards from `n // k` to 1.
- The variable `max_val` remains the same as it was initially determined.
- The variable `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`, and since `i` is 0 at the end of the loop, `m` is also 0.
- The variable `p` is the final value after the inner loop has completed all its iterations or until `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
- The variable `j` is `k`, indicating that the inner loop has completed its full range of iterations.
- The variable `k` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
- The loop will terminate if `p` becomes equal to `n` at any point, otherwise, `p` will be the final result of the inner loop's operations.
