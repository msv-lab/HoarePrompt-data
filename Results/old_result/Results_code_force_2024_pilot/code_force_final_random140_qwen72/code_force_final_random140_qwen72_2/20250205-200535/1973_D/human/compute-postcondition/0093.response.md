The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. The function does not return any value in all cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to perform some operations internally but does not return any value to the caller.

Functionality: **The function performs internal operations but does not return any value.**
