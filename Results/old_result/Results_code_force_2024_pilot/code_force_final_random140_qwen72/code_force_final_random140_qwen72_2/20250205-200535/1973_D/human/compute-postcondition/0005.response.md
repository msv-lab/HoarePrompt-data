The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was `t - 1` and it must be greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must now be `t - 1 - 1` (or simply `t - 2`) and it must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is `t - 2` and must be greater than 0.**
