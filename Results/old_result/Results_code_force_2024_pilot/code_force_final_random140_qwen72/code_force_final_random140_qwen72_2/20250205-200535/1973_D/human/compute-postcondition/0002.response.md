The function `func_3()` is called, but without knowing what `func_3()` does, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, since the initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and there is no indication that `func_3()` modifies `t` or any other variables, we assume that the function does not change the state of `t`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
