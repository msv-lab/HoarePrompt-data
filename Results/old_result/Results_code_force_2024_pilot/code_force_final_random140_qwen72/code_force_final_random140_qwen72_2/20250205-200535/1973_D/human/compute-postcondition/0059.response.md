The function `func_2(m)` is called, which implies that the function executes with the argument `m`. Since the details of `func_2` are not provided, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the changes it might make to the variables. However, we can infer that if `func_2` does not explicitly modify any of the global variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`, `j`, `k`), their values remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k - 1`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is the final value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, and `p` is equal to `n`
- `j` is `k`
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1

After calling `func_2(m)`, the only change is that `func_2` has been executed with `m` as its argument. The values of the variables remain the same unless `func_2` modifies them, which we cannot confirm without the function's definition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, and `p` is equal to `n`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `func_2(m)` has been executed.**
