Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, and `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `max_val` is set to `n - 2` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_val` remains as either 0 or `n - 1` depending on whether `r` was initially greater than `n` or not.***
