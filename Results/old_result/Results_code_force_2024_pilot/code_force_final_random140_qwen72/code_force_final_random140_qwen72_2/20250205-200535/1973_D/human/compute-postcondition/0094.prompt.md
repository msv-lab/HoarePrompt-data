You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        
        if r <= n:
            assert r == n
            max_val = i
            break
        
    #State: If the condition `r <= n` is met during any iteration, `max_val` will be set to the value of `i` at that point, and the loop will terminate. Otherwise, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, `max_val` will remain 0, and `r` will be the last computed value from `func_1(1, 1 * n)`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
        m = i * max_val
        
        p = 0
        
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if p >= n:
                p = 0
                break
            p = func_1(p + 1, m)
        
        if p == n:
            func_2(m)
            return
        
    #State: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` is 0, `max_val` is 0, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `m` is 0, `j` is `k`, `p` is the final value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, unless `p` became greater than or equal to `n` during any iteration, in which case `p` is set to 0 and the loop breaks early. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.
    func_2(-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function performs internal operations but does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value.

Case_2: The program does not return any value.

Case_3: The program returns nothing (None). The value of `p` was previously set to `n`, but since the return statement does not specify a value, the function ends without returning a specific value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
