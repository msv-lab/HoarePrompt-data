Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `p` is not equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
- No variables are modified by the `break` statement itself.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
