Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `p` and the current values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `k`.***
