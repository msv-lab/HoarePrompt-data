To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n // k`.
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0).
- `m` is `i * max_val`.
- `p` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`.
- `j` is `k`.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `p` is not equal to `n`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `n // k` down to 1 (inclusive) in steps of -1.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n // k`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

### Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
- Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n // k - 1`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is now `n // k - 1`.
- `max_val`, `m`, `p`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n`.**
