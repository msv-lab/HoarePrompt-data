To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k - 2`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `j` is `k`
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has executed `k` times. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks, and `p` retains the value it had when the condition was met. Otherwise, `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes all `k` iterations.
- `p` is equal to `n`

### Code Snippet:
```python
func_2(m)
```

### Analysis:
- The function `func_2(m)` is called with the argument `m`.
- The function `func_2` does not modify any of the variables directly mentioned in the initial state. It only processes the value of `m` and returns a result, which is not captured or stored in any variable in the given code snippet.

### Impact on Variables:
- Since `func_2(m)` does not modify any of the variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, `k`, or `p`, their values remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k - 2`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `j` is `k`
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `p` is equal to `n`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is equal to `n`.**
