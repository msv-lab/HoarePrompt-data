The function `func_3()` is called, but without knowing the implementation of `func_3()`, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, the initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and is currently `t - 1`. Assuming `func_3()` does not modify `t` or any other variables mentioned, the only change is that `t` is one less than its original value.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.**
