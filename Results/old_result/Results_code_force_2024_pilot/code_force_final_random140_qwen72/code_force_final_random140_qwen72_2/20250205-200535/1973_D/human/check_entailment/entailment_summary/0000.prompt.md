Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is an interactive problem.

Fox gave Cat two positive integers n and k . She has a hidden array a_1,
\ldots , a_n of length n , such that 1 \leq a_i \leq n for every i . Now they
are going to play the following game:

For any two integers l, r such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n , define f(l, r) =
(r - l + 1) \cdot \max\limits_{x=l}^r a_x . In other words, f(l, r) is equal
to the maximum of the subarray a_l, \ldots, a_r multiplied by its size.

Cat can ask Fox at most 2 n questions about the array. He will tell her two
integers l and x (1 \leq l \leq n, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ), and she will tell him
one integer p as the answer — the smallest positive integer r such that f(l,
r) = x , or n+1 if no such r exists.

Now, Cat needs to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence
c_1, \ldots, c_{k-1} such that 1 \leq c_1 < \ldots < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1)
= f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = \ldots = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m . If no such m exists, he
should indicate this and take -1 as the answer. Note that for k = 1 , m is
always equal to f(1, n) .

In other words, the goal is to find the largest m such that you can split the
array into exactly k subarrays (k is the constant given to you in the
beginning of the interaction) so that all the subarrays have the product of
their length and their maximum equal to m , or determine that no such m
exists. Every element should belong in exactly one of the subarrays.

Cat doesn't know what he should do, so he asked you to play the game for him.

Interaction

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1
\leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 ) — the length of the hidden array and the number of
subarrays in the desired split.

Now you are allowed to make queries in the following way — print one line of
the form "\mathtt{?} \ l \ x " (it must hold that 1 \leq l \leq n , 1 \leq x
\leq 10^9 ) and you will receive the smallest integer r such that l \leq r
\leq n and f(l, r) = x , or n + 1 if no such r exists.

If you want to print the answer, output "\mathtt{!} \ m " and you will recieve
1 if your answer is correct and -1 otherwise. In the first case, the
interaction continues with the next test case. Note that printing the answer
doesn't count towards the number of queries made. Please note that you don't
receive the values for the next test case immediately, you will first have to
read whether your answer to the last test case was correct.

If you receive the integer -1 at any moment, it means your program has made an
invalid query, exceeded the query limit, or gave an incorrect answer. Your
program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the
output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the total sum of n over the test cases won't exceed 10^4
.

Hacks

The format of the hacks should be the following: the first line should contain
one integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases should follow.

The first line of each test case should contain two integers n and k (1 \leq k
\leq n \leq 10^4 ) — the length of the array a and the number of subarrays you
want to split it into.

The second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \leq a_i
\leq n ).

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

    ? 4 6
    
    ! 6

Note

The hidden arrays in the three testcases are [1] , [1, 2] and [1, 3, 6, 1, 2,
1] . In the second testcase, no split satisfies the constraints, so the answer
is -1 .

The answer for the first query of the third testcase is 7 since no valid r
exists. For the second query of the third testcase, since 2 \cdot \max(1, 3) =
6 , we will get 2 as the answer, since r = 1 doesn't satisfy the constraint.

The sample interaction guessed all three answers (1, -1 and 6 ) correctly, so
it received 1 after each answer.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import sys

func_4()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(l, x):
    print(f'? {l} {x}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    ret = int(input())
    assert ret >= 0
    return ret
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `l` and `x`, where `l` is an integer between 1 and n, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. It prints a query string in the format `? [l] [x]` to the standard output and then reads an integer input from the standard input. The function returns this integer value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(m):
    print(f'! {m}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    ret = int(input())
    assert ret == 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes an integer `m` as input and prints it in a specific format. It then reads an integer from standard input and returns this integer. The function does not modify the input `m` but uses it to determine the format of the printed message. The returned value is determined by the user's input and is not directly related to the input `m`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        if r <= n:
            assert r == n
            max_val = i
            break
    assert max_val > 0
    for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
        m = i * max_val
        p = 0
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            p = func_1(p + 1, m)
            if p >= n:
                break
        if p == n:
            func_2(m)
            return
    func_2(-1)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). It then attempts to find a specific value `m` such that a series of calls to `func_1` results in a value `p` that equals `n`. If such a value `m` is found, it calls `func_2(m)`. If no such value is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`. The function does not return any value.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_3()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates `t` times, calling the function `func_3` in each iteration. After completing all iterations, the value of `t` is unchanged. The function does not return any value.
