Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `p = 0` sets the variable `p` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
