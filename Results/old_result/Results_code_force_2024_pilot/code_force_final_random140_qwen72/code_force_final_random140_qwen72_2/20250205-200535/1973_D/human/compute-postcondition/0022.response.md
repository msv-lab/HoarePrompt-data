Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `p` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, or `m`. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `p` being set to 0.
