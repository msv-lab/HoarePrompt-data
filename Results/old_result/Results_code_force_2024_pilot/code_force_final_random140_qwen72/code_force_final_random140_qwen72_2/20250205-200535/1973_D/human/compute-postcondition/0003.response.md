The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `t`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and simply iterates over the range defined by `t`, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before the start of the next iteration. However, since the loop has already run once, `t` should now be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`)**
