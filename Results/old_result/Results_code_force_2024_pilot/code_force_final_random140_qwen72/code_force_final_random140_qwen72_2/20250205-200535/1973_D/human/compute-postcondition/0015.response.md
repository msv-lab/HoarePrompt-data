Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, `max_val` is `n - 2`, and `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `max_val` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is initially `n - 2`, `max_val` now holds the value `n - 2`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.
