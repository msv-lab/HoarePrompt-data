Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `n` is 2 correctly. According to the problem description, when `n` is 2, the only possible permutation is `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, and the maximum XOR value is `1`. However, the program incorrectly prints the same index twice (`ans` and `ans1`), which means it outputs a pair like `(0, 0)` or `(1, 1)`, both of which have an XOR value of `0`.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
2
```
The program will output:
```
! 0 0
```
or
```
! 1 1
```
Both of these outputs are incorrect because the correct output should be:
```
! 0 1
```
or
```
! 1 0
```
This is a clear violation of the problem requirements, making the program incorrect.
