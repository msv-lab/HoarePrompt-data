### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - It uses `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of pairs and updates `ans1` if the current index \(i\) yields a greater result.
   - After finding `ans1`, it initializes `mx` to 0 and a list `v` containing 0.
   - It then iterates through the indices again, comparing the bitwise OR of pairs involving `ans1` and updates `mx` and `v` accordingly.
   - Finally, it finds the maximum value within the list `v` and prints the result.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly uses the `func_1` function to make queries and update the necessary variables.
   - The logic for finding `ans1` and `mx` seems to be designed to identify the indices that maximize the bitwise OR operations.
   - The final step of finding the maximum value within `v` ensures that the indices with the maximum XOR value are selected.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if the number of queries exceeds \(3n\), but it appears to be structured in a way that should not exceed this limit.
   - The logic for updating `v` and `mx` is correct, ensuring that the maximum XOR value is found.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program follows the problem constraints and logic correctly.
   - It uses the allowed number of queries and correctly identifies the indices with the maximum XOR value.
