Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are constrained such that \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\).
- `n` is an integer with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', a, b, c, d)
```

When this statement is executed, it will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we can only describe them based on the constraints given. Each of these variables will be a non-negative integer less than `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where [a], [b], [c], and [d] are non-negative integers such that 0 <= [a], [b], [c], [d] < n, and n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^4)**
