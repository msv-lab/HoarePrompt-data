Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It uses a series of queries to identify the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized, adhering to the constraints and the interactive nature of the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Loop Setup**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Finding the First Maximum Index (`ans1`)**:
   - The program iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`, comparing each index with the current maximum index (`ans1`) using the bitwise OR operation.
   - If the result of the comparison indicates that the new index is greater, it updates `ans1`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Index (`mx`)**:
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and creates a list `v` to store potential candidates for the second maximum index.
   - It iterates through the indices again, comparing each index with the current maximum index (`ans1`) and the current candidate for the second maximum index (`mx`).
   - Based on the comparison results, it updates `mx` and the list `v` accordingly.

4. **Refining the Second Maximum Index**:
   - After identifying potential candidates for the second maximum index, the program further refines the selection by comparing the candidates among themselves.
   - It ensures that the final selected index `ans` is indeed the one that maximizes the XOR value with `ans1`.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - The program outputs the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the final answer.

The program also handles the interactive queries correctly by flushing the output after each query and reading the response from the interactor. This ensures that the program adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
