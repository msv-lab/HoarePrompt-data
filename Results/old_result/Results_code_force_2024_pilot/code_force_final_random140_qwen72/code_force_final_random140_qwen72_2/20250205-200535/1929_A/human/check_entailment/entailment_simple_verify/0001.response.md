Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The mathematical expression for the beauty is:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
   \]
   To maximize this sum, we need to ensure that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are as large as possible.

2. **Optimal Rearrangement**: Sorting the array in ascending order is indeed the optimal way to achieve this. When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are minimized for the smallest elements and maximized for the largest elements, leading to the highest possible sum of differences.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension.
   - It prints the result.

4. **Verification**:
   - The sorting step ensures that the array is in ascending order, which is the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty.
   - The calculation of the sum of differences is done correctly using a list comprehension and the `sum` function.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop to process each test case independently.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), resulting in a beauty of 0.
   - It also handles the general case where the elements are distinct and can be rearranged to maximize the beauty.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
