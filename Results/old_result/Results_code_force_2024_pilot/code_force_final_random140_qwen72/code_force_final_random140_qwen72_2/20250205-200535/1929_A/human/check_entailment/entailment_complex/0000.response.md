Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in ascending order because the difference between consecutive elements will be minimized, leading to the maximum possible sum of these differences.

The provided program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the length of the array, `n`.
2. Reads the array elements and sorts them.
3. Calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
4. Prints the result for each test case.

This approach is correct because sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the goal of the problem. The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
