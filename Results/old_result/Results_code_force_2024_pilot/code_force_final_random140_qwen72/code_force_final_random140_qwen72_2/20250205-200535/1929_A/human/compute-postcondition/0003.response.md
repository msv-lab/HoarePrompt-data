To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List Comprehension**: The expression inside the `sum` function is a list comprehension that iterates over the indices from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates indices from 1 to `n-1`).
2. **Difference Calculation**: For each index `i` in this range, it calculates the difference between the current element `ar[i]` and the previous element `ar[i - 1]`.
3. **Summation**: The `sum` function then adds up all these differences.

### Explanation:
- Since `ar` is a sorted list of integers, the differences `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]` represent the gaps between consecutive elements in the list.
- Summing these differences will give the total difference between the last element `ar[n-1]` and the first element `ar[0]`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the total difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `ar`.

Output: **ar[n-1] - ar[0]** (where `ar[n-1]` is the last element of the list `ar` and `ar[0]` is the first element of the list `ar`)
