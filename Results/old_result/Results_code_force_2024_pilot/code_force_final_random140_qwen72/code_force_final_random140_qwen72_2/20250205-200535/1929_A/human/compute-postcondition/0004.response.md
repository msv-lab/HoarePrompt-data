The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The variable `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `_` is 0.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (since `_` starts from 0).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, and the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
