Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))` updates the variable `ar` to be a sorted list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `ar` is a sorted list of integers, which means the elements in `ar` are now in ascending order.
