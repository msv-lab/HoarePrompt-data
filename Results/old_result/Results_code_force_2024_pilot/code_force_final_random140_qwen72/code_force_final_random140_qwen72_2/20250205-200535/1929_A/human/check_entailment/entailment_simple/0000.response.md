Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array after potentially rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last.

### Analysis of the Provided Solution:
1. **Input Handling**: The solution correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `ar` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when subtracting smaller elements from larger ones, which maximizes the sum of these differences.
3. **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty is calculated using a list comprehension that computes the sum of `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `n = 3`, `ar = [2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted `ar = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `n = 3`, `ar = [69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted `ar = [69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `n = 5`, `ar = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted `ar = [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
  - Output: `57` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: 
  - Input: `n = 4`, `ar = [3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted `ar = [3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: 
  - Input: `n = 2`, `ar = [2, 1]`
  - Sorted `ar = [1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly handles all test cases and produces the expected output. The logic of sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
