The code snippet `ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `ar` is updated to be a new sorted list of integers input by the user.
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.**
