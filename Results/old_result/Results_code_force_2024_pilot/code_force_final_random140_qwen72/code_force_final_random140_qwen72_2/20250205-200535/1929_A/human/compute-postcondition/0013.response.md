The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers. Each test case is defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the length of the array `a`, which contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

The function's output is not specified in the provided context, but typically, such a function would process each test case and return some result based on the array `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case based on the array `a`.**
