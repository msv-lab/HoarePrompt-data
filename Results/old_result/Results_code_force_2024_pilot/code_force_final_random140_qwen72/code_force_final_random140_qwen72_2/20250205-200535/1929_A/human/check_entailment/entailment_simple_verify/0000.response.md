Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the provided program. The program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements. While this approach ensures that the differences are non-negative, it does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined by the problem statement.

The problem requires maximizing the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. To achieve this, the optimal strategy is to alternate the largest and smallest remaining elements in the sorted array. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty is `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` or `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which yields:
```
(5-1) + (2-5) + (4-2) + (3-4) = 4 + (-3) + 2 + (-1) = 2
```
But the correct maximum beauty is:
```
(5-1) + (4-2) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8
```

The provided program fails to achieve this optimal arrangement and thus does not always produce the correct result. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
