Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not always produce the correct result for maximizing the beauty of the array. The issue lies in the approach used to calculate the maximum beauty. The current implementation sorts the array and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, this does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined by the problem statement.

To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized. This can be achieved by alternating the largest and smallest remaining elements in the sorted array. For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` or `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which would yield a higher beauty value.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The current program will sort the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and calculate the beauty as:
```
(2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) + (5-4) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
```
However, the optimal arrangement is `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` or `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which gives:
```
(5-1) + (2-5) + (4-2) + (3-4) = 4 + (-3) + 2 + (-1) = 2
```
But the correct maximum beauty is actually:
```
(5-1) + (4-2) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8
```
Thus, the program does not always produce the correct result, making it incorrect.
