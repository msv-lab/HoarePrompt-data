Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. Mathematically, this is:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
   \]
   To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

2. **Optimal Rearrangement**: Sorting the array in ascending order is indeed the optimal way to achieve this. By sorting, we ensure that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are minimized for the smallest elements and maximized for the largest elements, leading to the highest possible sum.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension and the `sum` function.
   - It prints the result.

4. **Verification**:
   - The sorting step ensures that the array is in ascending order, which is the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty.
   - The calculation of the sum of differences is done correctly using a list comprehension and the `sum` function.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop to process each test case independently.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Final: **True**
