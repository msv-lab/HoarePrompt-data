To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `_` is 1 (though it is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List Comprehension**: The expression inside the `sum` function is a list comprehension that iterates over the indices from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates indices from 1 to `n-1`).
2. **Difference Calculation**: For each index `i` in the range, it calculates the difference between the current element `ar[i]` and the previous element `ar[i - 1]`.
3. **Summation**: The `sum` function then adds up all these differences.

### Explanation:
- Since `ar` is a sorted list of integers, the difference `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]` represents the gap between consecutive elements in the list.
- Summing these differences gives the total sum of the gaps between all consecutive elements in the list.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`.

Output: **sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`**

This means the output will be the total sum of the gaps between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `ar`.
