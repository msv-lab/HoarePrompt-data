Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `prices` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * (prices[0] + prices[1])`, `tickets_bought` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` plus the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `tickets_to_buy` to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `total_cost`, and `tickets_bought`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `tickets_to_buy` is calculated based on the current values of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.
- The condition that `tickets_bought` equals `k` and the subsequent breaking out of the loop or if statement is not affected by this code snippet.
