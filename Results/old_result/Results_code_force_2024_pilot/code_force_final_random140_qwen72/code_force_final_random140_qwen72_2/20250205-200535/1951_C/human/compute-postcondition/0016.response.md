To determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `prices` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Inputs:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `t` is a variable that must be greater than 2, but it is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `_` is set to 2, but it is also not directly used in the `print` statement.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` is called with the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.
   - The return value of this function is stored in the variable `result`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`.
- However, we know that `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when it is called with the specified arguments.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will print the value returned by the function `func_1` when it is called with the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
