Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `_`, `prices`, and `result` remain unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned the values from the input split by spaces, converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Thus, `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific input integers.
