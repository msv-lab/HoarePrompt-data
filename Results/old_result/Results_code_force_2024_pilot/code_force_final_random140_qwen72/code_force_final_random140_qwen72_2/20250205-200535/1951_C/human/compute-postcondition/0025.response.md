Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `prices` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * (prices[0] + prices[1]) + tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, `tickets_bought` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` plus the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought` before the increment, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought` before the increment, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
