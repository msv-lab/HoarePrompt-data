Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list `prices` of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.**
