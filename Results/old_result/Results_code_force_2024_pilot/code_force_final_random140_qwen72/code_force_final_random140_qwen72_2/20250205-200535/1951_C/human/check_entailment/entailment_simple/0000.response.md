Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Sorting Prices**: The program sorts the `prices` list in ascending order. This ensures that the program always buys tickets at the lowest available prices first, which is a key part of minimizing the total cost.

3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program uses a loop to purchase tickets. In each iteration, it calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`) as the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`). It then updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought. The loop breaks once the required number of tickets (`k`) has been purchased.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases where `k` is less than or equal to `m`, meaning all tickets can be bought in a single day. It also handles cases where `k` is much larger, requiring multiple days to purchase all tickets.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the sum of the costs of buying the required number of tickets at the lowest possible prices.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
