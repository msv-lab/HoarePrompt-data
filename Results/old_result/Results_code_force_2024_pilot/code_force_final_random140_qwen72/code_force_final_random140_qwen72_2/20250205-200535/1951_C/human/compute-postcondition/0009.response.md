The code snippet `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `prices`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `prices` is a list of integers input by the user
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`

After executing the code snippet, the variable `prices` is updated to a new list of integers based on the user's input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
