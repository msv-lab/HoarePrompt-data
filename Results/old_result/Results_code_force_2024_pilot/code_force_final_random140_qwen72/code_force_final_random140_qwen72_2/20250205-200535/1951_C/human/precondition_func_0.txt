n is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, m is a positive integer representing the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, k is a positive integer representing the total number of tickets to buy, and prices is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. Additionally, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9).
