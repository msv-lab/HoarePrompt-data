### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, where each day has a different ticket price and there is a limit of `m` tickets that can be purchased per day.
   - Additionally, purchasing tickets on a day increases the price of tickets on subsequent days.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function sorts the `prices` list in ascending order to ensure that tickets are bought at the lowest possible prices first.
     - It iterates through the sorted prices, buying up to `m` tickets each day until `k` tickets are purchased.
     - The function correctly accounts for the increasing prices due to ticket purchases by sorting the prices initially and then buying tickets in the order of increasing prices.
     - The function ensures that the total cost is minimized by always choosing the cheapest available tickets first.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.
     - The function correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions handle edge cases such as when `k` is less than or equal to `m` (buying all tickets in one day).
   - The functions also handle the case where `k` is greater than `m` and requires multiple days to purchase all tickets.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The approach of sorting the prices and buying tickets in the order of increasing prices is optimal for minimizing the total cost.
   - The functions correctly implement the logic and handle the input/output as required.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
