Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `result` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
