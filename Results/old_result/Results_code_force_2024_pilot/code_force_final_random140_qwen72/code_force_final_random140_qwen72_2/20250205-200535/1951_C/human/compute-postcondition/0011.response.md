To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `prices` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

2. **Understanding the Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.
   - Without the actual implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of this function.

3. **What Will Be Printed:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `result`.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`)**
