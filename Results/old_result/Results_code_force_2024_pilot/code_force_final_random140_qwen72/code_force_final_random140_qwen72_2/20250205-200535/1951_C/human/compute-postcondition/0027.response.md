Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking early, `m` remains a positive integer, `k` remains a positive integer, `prices` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying the required number of tickets at the lowest possible prices, `tickets_bought` is `k` (the total number of tickets to buy), `tickets_to_buy` is 0 (since all tickets have been bought).**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations or exited early due to all tickets being bought, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `n` retains its original value as the total number of sale days.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early.
- The variable `m` remains unchanged as the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged as the total number of tickets to buy.
- The list `prices` remains unchanged as the sorted list of ticket prices for each sale day.
- The variable `total_cost` will be the total cost incurred for buying all `k` tickets at the lowest possible prices.
- The variable `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, indicating that all the required tickets have been purchased.
- The variable `tickets_to_buy` will be 0, as no more tickets need to be bought once the loop exits.
