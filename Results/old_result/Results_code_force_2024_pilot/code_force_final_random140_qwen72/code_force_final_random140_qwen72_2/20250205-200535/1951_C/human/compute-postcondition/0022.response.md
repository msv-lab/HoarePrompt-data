The code snippet `cost = tickets_to_buy * prices[i]` calculates the cost of buying a certain number of tickets at the price indexed by `i` in the `prices` list. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `prices` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers
- `total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * (prices[0] + prices[1])`
- `tickets_bought` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` plus the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`
- `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`

The code `cost = tickets_to_buy * prices[i]` updates the variable `cost` to be the product of `tickets_to_buy` and the price at index `i` in the `prices` list. Since `i` is 2, the price used is `prices[2]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `prices` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers
- `total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * (prices[0] + prices[1])`
- `tickets_bought` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` plus the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`
- `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`
- `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `prices` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * (prices[0] + prices[1])`, `tickets_bought` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` plus the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`.**
