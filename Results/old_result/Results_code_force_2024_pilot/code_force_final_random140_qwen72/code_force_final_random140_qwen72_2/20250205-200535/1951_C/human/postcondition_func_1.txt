The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `prices`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.
