The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `_` is 1. At the start of the next iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2, and for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
