Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

### Explanation:
- **`T`**: The value of `T` remains `T - 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: The value of `p` must be greater than or equal to 0, as the loop runs `p` times.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`S`**: After all iterations, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `p-1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `p-1`.
- **`C`**: The value of `C` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`den`**: The value of `den` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: The value of `g` remains the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`num`**: The value of `num` is calculated as `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g` after all iterations.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is calculated as `num * den % MOD` after all iterations.
