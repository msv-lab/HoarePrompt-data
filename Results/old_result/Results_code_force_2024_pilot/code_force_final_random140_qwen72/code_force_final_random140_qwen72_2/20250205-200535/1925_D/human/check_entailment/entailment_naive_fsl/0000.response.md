Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `num` and `den` is incorrect. The program incorrectly multiplies the number of pairs `C` and the sum of friendship values `S` in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Issue Explanation:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value using a formula that does not correctly account for the probability of selecting a friend pair and the subsequent increase in friendship value.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion and summing these expected values over all excursions.

2. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula used in the program:
     ```python
     num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
     den = 2 * C * C
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly represent the expected value calculation. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the initial friendship values.

### Correct Approach:
- For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs divided by the total number of possible pairs, plus the number of friend pairs (since each friend pair's value increases by 1 if selected).
- The expected value for `k` excursions can be calculated as:
  ```python
  expected_value = (S + p) * k / C
  ```
- This needs to be adjusted for modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required modulo.

### Example Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  3 1 2
  1 2 1
  ```
  - Here, `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and the only friend pair is `(1, 2)` with an initial friendship value of `1`.
  - The total number of possible pairs `C` is `3 * (3 - 1) // 2 = 3`.
  - The expected value for each excursion is `(1 + 1) / 3 = 2 / 3`.
  - Over 2 excursions, the expected value is `2 * (2 / 3) = 4 / 3`.
  - The program's current formula does not correctly compute this expected value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed formula used to calculate the expected value.
