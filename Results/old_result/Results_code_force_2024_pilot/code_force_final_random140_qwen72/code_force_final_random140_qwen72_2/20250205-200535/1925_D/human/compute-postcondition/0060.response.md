To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is `T - 1`: This indicates that `T` is being decremented by 1, but it does not affect the other variables directly.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs.
   - `i` is `p - 1`.
   - `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`: This is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, also known as the binomial coefficient "n choose 2".
   - `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`.
   - `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`.
   - `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`.
   - `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

2. **Calculations:**
   - `C = n * (n - 1) // 2`: This is the binomial coefficient "n choose 2".
   - `g = gcd(num, den)`: The greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
   - `num = (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`: This is the numerator of the fraction after dividing by the GCD.
   - `den = modinv(2 * C * C // g, MOD)`: This is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`.
   - `ans = num * den % MOD`: The final result is the product of `num` and `den` modulo `MOD`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the result of the calculation `num * den % MOD`.

Given the complexity of the calculations and the dependencies on the input values, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `p`, `k`, and `S`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of the calculation (num * den) % MOD, with num and den derived from the given formulas and input values)**
