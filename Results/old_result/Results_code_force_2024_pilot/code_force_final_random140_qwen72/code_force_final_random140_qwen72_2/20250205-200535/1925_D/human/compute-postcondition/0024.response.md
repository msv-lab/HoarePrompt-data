To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `p`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `p` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `S` is 0.
- `i` is `p-1`.
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`.
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
- `num` is `num // g`.
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

For the loop to execute, `p` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is 0, `i` is 0, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**
