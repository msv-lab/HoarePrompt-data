Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue with the formula used in the program to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The program's formula:
```python
num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
den = 2 * C * C
```
is indeed incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Calculation:
To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider the following:
1. **Initial Friendship Values:** The sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs, denoted as \( S \).
2. **Number of Friend Pairs:** The number of friend pairs, denoted as \( p \).
3. **Total Number of Possible Pairs:** The total number of possible pairs, denoted as \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is:
- The sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs, \( S \), divided by the total number of possible pairs, \( C \).
- Plus the number of friend pairs, \( p \), because each friend pair's value increases by 1 if selected.

Thus, the expected value for each excursion is:
\[ \text{Expected Increase} = \frac{S}{C} + \frac{p}{C} = \frac{S + p}{C} \]

Over \( k \) excursions, the total expected value is:
\[ \text{Total Expected Value} = k \times \left( \frac{S + p}{C} \right) \]

This needs to be adjusted for modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Corrected Formula:
The corrected formula should be:
```python
expected_value = k * (S + p) * pow(C, -1, MOD) % MOD
```

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the example case provided:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 1 2
  1 2 1
  ```
- Here, \( n = 3 \), \( m = 1 \), \( k = 2 \), and the only friend pair is \( (1, 2) \) with an initial friendship value of \( 1 \).
- The total number of possible pairs \( C \) is \( 3 \times (3 - 1) // 2 = 3 \).
- The expected value for each excursion is \( \frac{1 + 1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \).
- Over 2 excursions, the expected value is \( 2 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \).

Using modular arithmetic:
- \( \frac{4}{3} \mod (10^9 + 7) \) can be computed as \( 4 \times 3^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).
- The modular inverse of 3 modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) is \( 333333336 \) (since \( 3 \times 333333336 \equiv 1 \mod (10^9 + 7) \)).
- Therefore, \( 4 \times 333333336 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 1333333344 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 400000048 \).

The program's current formula does not correctly compute this expected value, confirming the original assessment's correctness.

Final: **False**
