To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `p`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the integer value of the third element in the initial input plus the integer value of the third element in the new input
- `i` is 1
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`
- `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(p):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `p`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 2) is less than `p`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `p` remains the same and must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element in the initial input plus the integer value of the third element in the new input, `i` is 2, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
