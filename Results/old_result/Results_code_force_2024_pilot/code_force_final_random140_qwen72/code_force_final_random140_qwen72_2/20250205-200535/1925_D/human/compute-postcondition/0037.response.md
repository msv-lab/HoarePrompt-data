The code snippet updates the value of `den` by computing its modular multiplicative inverse under modulo `MOD`. This means `den` is updated to the value such that when multiplied by the original `den`, the result is congruent to 1 modulo `MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `p` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines.
- `i` is `p-1`.
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `den` is `2 * C * C // g`.
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
- `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`.
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `den` is updated to `pow(den, -1, MOD)`, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` under modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
