The code snippet `S += int(input().split()[2])` updates the value of `S` by adding the integer value of the third element from a new input split by spaces.

- Initial State:
  - `T` is `T - 1`
  - `n` is an input integer
  - `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1
  - `k` is an input integer
  - `S` is the integer value of the third element in the input split by spaces
  - `i` is 1
  - `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
  - `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`
  - `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`
  - `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
  - `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

- Impact of the Code:
  - `S` is updated to `S + int(input().split()[2])`
  - All other variables remain unchanged

- Calculation:
  - Let the new input be `a b c d e` (where `c` is the third element).
  - The new value of `S` is `S + int(c)`.

- Output State:
  - `T` is `T - 1`
  - `n` is an input integer
  - `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1
  - `k` is an input integer
  - `S` is the integer value of the third element in the initial input plus the integer value of the third element in the new input
  - `i` is 1
  - `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
  - `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`
  - `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`
  - `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
  - `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element in the initial input plus the integer value of the third element in the new input, `i` is 1, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
