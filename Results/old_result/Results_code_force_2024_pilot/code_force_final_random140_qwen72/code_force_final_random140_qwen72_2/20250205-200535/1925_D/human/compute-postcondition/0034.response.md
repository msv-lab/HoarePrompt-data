Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `num`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
