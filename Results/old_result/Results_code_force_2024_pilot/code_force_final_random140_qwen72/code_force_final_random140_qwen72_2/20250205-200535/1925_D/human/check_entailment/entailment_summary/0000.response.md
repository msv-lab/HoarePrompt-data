Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, with the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Let's break down the key components and logic of the program to evaluate its correctness:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `p`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of friend pairs, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `S` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program reads `p` lines of input, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It correctly sums the `f_i` values into `S`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - It then calculates the numerator `num` and the denominator `den` of the expected value formula:
     \[
     \text{num} = p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S
     \]
     \[
     \text{den} = 2 \cdot C \cdot C
     \]
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both `num` and `den` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

4. **Modular Inverse and Final Calculation**:
   - The program computes the modular inverse of `den` using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.
   - It then calculates the final answer as `num * den % MOD` and prints it.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the edge case where there are no friend pairs (`p = 0`) correctly, as the sum `S` will be 0, leading to an expected value of 0.
   - The program ensures that the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The use of modular arithmetic and the gcd for simplifying fractions is appropriate for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
