The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `p`, and `k`. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the input provided.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers.
- `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
- `p` is the same as the initial `p`.
- `i` is `p-1`.
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`.
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
- `num` is `num // g`.
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `p`, and `k` are updated to the new values provided by the input.
- The values of `T`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `g`, `num`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
