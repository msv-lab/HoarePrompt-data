Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is 0, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.** 

Explanation: The variable `S` is reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
