The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of nodes `n`, a parameter `p`, and a condition `k`. It then reads `p` lines of input, each containing three integers, and sums the third integer from each line. Using this sum and other derived values, it calculates a result based on a specific formula involving modular arithmetic and prints the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
