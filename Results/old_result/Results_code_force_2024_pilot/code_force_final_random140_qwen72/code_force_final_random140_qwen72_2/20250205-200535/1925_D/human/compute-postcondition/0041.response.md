The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `p`, and `k`. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the new inputs, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**. 

The values of `n`, `p`, and `k` have been updated to the new input values, while the rest of the variables retain their previous definitions and values.
