The code snippet `C = n * (n - 1) // 2` recalculates the value of `C` based on the current value of `n`. Since `C` was already defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2` in the initial state, the value of `C` remains unchanged. All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `den`, `g`, `num`, `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
