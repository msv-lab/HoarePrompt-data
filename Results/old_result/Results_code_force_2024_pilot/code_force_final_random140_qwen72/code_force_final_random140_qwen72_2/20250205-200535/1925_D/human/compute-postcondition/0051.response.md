The provided code snippet updates the value of `num` based on the formula `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `num` is recalculated using the new formula: `num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `g`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs
- `i` is `p - 1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`
- `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

After executing the code:
- `num` is updated to `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
