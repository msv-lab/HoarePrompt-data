Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `p` is the same as the initial `p`, `i` is `p-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`T`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`, `p`, `k`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`S`**: After all iterations, `S` will be the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
- **`p`**: The value of `p` remains the same as it was initially, as it is only used to determine the number of iterations but is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `p-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `p-1`.
