Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element in the initial input plus the integer value of the third element in the new input plus the integer value of the third element in the latest input, `i` is 2, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
