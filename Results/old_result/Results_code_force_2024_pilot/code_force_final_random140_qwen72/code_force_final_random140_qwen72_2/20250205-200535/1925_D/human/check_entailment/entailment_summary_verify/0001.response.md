### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m` (number of pairs of friends), and `k` (number of excursions).

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `S` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It then reads the `m` pairs and sums up their friendship values. This part is correct.

3. **Calculating Total Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the combination formula \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is correct.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `num` and the denominator `den` for the expected value.
   - The formula used for the numerator is \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \).
   - The formula used for the denominator is \( 2 \cdot C \cdot C \).

   However, the formula for the numerator seems incorrect. The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values should be derived from the probability of selecting a friend pair and the increase in friendship value. The correct formula should be:
   \[
   \text{Expected Value} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k + 1)}{2 \cdot C}
   \]
   where \( m \) is the number of friend pairs, \( k \) is the number of excursions, and \( C \) is the total number of possible pairs.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction.
   - It then computes the modular inverse of the simplified denominator using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.

6. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program multiplies the simplified numerator by the modular inverse of the simplified denominator and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis:
- The program's logic for reading inputs and summing friendship values is correct.
- The calculation of the total number of possible pairs is correct.
- The formula used for the expected value calculation is incorrect, leading to potential wrong results.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used for the expected value calculation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
