### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the provided function summary to determine if the assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - Each of the `m` pairs has a friendship value `f_i`.

2. **Output:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Key Points:**
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value is calculated based on the probability of choosing a friend pair and the initial friendship values.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.
- It calculates a result using a specific formula and prints the result.

#### Original Assessment Analysis:
- The original assessment states that the program has a logical error in the formula used to calculate the expected value.
- The formula used in the program is:
  ```python
  num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
  den = 2 * C * C
  ```
- This formula is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly account for the probability of selecting a friend pair and the subsequent increase in friendship value.

#### Correct Formula:
- The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion.
- The expected value for each excursion is:
  \[
  \text{expected\_value} = \left(\frac{S + m}{C}\right)
  \]
  where:
  - `S` is the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
  - `m` is the number of friend pairs.
  - `C` is the total number of possible pairs, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

- Over `k` excursions, the expected value is:
  \[
  \text{total\_expected\_value} = k \times \left(\frac{S + m}{C}\right)
  \]

- This needs to be adjusted for modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Example Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  3 1 2
  1 2 1
  ```
  - Here, `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and the only friend pair is `(1, 2)` with an initial friendship value of `1`.
  - The total number of possible pairs `C` is \(3 \times (3 - 1) // 2 = 3\).
  - The expected value for each excursion is \(\frac{1 + 1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\).
  - Over 2 excursions, the expected value is \(2 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\).
  - The program's current formula does not correctly compute this expected value.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program uses an incorrect formula to calculate the expected value, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
