The code snippet `num = num // g` performs an integer division of `num` by `g`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`. This operation updates the value of `num` to the quotient of this division.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers
- `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop
- `p` is the same as the initial `p`
- `i` is `p-1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`
- `den` is `2 * C * C`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`

After executing the code snippet:
- `num` is updated to `num // g`, which means `num` is now the result of dividing `num` by its GCD with `den`.

The other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `g`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `p` is the same as the initial `p`, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `num` is `num // g`.**
