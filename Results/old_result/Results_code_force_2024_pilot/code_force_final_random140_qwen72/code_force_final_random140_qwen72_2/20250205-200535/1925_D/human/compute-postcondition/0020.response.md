To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers.
- `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
- `p` remains the same as the initial `p`.
- `i` is `p - 1`.
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`.
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
- `num` is `num // g`.
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `C`:**
   \[
   C = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}
   \]
   This is the combination formula for choosing 2 items out of `n`.

2. **Calculate `g`:**
   \[
   g = \gcd(\text{num}, 2 \times C \times C)
   \]
   Here, `gcd` stands for the greatest common divisor.

3. **Update `num`:**
   \[
   \text{num} = \frac{\text{num}}{g}
   \]

4. **Calculate `den`:**
   \[
   \text{den} = \text{modular\_multiplicative\_inverse}\left(\frac{2 \times C \times C}{g}, \text{MOD}\right)
   \]
   The modular multiplicative inverse of a number `a` modulo `m` is a number `b` such that:
   \[
   (a \times b) \equiv 1 \pmod{m}
   \]

5. **Calculate `ans`:**
   \[
   \text{ans} = (\text{num} \times \text{den}) \% \text{MOD}
   \]

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the result of the above calculations. Since the exact values of `n`, `p`, `k`, and `num` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the operations performed.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of the calculation num * den % MOD, with num being the initial num divided by the gcd of num and 2 * C * C, and den being the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 * C * C // gcd(num, 2 * C * C) modulo MOD)**
