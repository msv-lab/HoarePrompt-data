Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `S` will contain the sum of the third elements from all `p` input lines. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `p-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. All other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `C`, `den`, `g`, `num`, and `ans`) will retain their values as they were not modified within the loop.
