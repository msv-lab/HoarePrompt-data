Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for pairs of children chosen for excursions, with the result given as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: For each test case, it calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of the pairs of friends.
3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: It calculates the total number of possible pairs \( C \) using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program computes the numerator and denominator for the expected value calculation:
   - **Numerator**: \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \)
   - **Denominator**: \( 2 \cdot C \cdot C \)
5. **GCD and Simplification**: It simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
6. **Modular Inverse**: It computes the modular multiplicative inverse of the simplified denominator.
7. **Final Answer**: It calculates the final answer as \( \text{num} \cdot \text{den}^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Potential Issues:
- **Variable Naming**: The variable `p` is used instead of `m` in the input reading, which might cause confusion but does not affect the correctness of the logic.
- **Combination Calculation**: The calculation of \( C \) is correct.
- **Expected Value Formula**: The formula used for the expected value seems to be derived correctly based on the problem statement.
- **GCD and Simplification**: The use of GCD to simplify the fraction is appropriate.
- **Modular Inverse**: The use of `pow(den, -1, MOD)` to compute the modular inverse is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the correct logic and steps to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent logical errors in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
