Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `p` is the same as the initial `p`, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `den` is assigned the value `2 * C * C`.
- The value of `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `num`) retain their initial values or expressions as specified in the initial state.
