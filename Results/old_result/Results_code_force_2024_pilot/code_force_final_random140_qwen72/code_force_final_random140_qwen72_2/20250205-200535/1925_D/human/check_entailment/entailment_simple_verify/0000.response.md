Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a logical error in the program. The formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is indeed incorrect. Let's break down the issues and the correct approach:

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program uses the formula:
     ```python
     num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
     den = 2 * C * C
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly represent the expected value calculation. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the initial friendship values.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs divided by the total number of possible pairs, plus the number of friend pairs (since each friend pair's value increases by 1 if selected).
   - The correct formula for the expected value for `k` excursions is:
     ```python
     expected_value = (S + p) * k / C
     ```
   - This needs to be adjusted for modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required modulo.

### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the total number of possible pairs `C`:
  ```python
  C = n * (n - 1) // 2
  ```
- Calculate the sum of initial friendship values `S`:
  ```python
  S = sum(f_i for _ in range(p))
  ```
- Calculate the expected value for `k` excursions:
  ```python
  expected_value = (S + p) * k / C
  ```
- Adjust for modular arithmetic:
  ```python
  expected_value = ((S + p) * k * pow(C, -1, MOD)) % MOD
  ```

### Example Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  3 1 2
  1 2 1
  ```
  - Here, `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and the only friend pair is `(1, 2)` with an initial friendship value of `1`.
  - The total number of possible pairs `C` is `3 * (3 - 1) // 2 = 3`.
  - The sum of initial friendship values `S` is `1`.
  - The expected value for each excursion is `(1 + 1) / 3 = 2 / 3`.
  - Over 2 excursions, the expected value is `2 * (2 / 3) = 4 / 3`.
  - Using modular arithmetic:
    ```python
    expected_value = ((1 + 1) * 2 * pow(3, -1, MOD)) % MOD
    expected_value = (2 * 2 * 2) % MOD
    expected_value = 8 % MOD
    expected_value = 8
    ```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical error in the program. The formula used to calculate the expected value is incorrect, and the correct approach involves a different formula that accounts for the probability of selecting a friend pair and the initial friendship values.

Final: **False**
