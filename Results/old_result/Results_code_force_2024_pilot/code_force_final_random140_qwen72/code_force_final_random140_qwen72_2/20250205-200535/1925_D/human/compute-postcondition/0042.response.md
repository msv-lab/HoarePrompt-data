Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is 0, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `S` to 0.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `g`, `num`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `S` was previously the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, but now it is explicitly set to 0.
