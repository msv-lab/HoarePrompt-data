Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Summing Friendship Values**: The program correctly sums the friendship values `f_i` for the `m` pairs of friends. This is done using a loop that reads `m` lines and adds the third integer from each line to `S`.

3. **Calculating Combinations**: The program calculates the number of possible pairs `C` using the combination formula \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{num} = p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S
   \]
   \[
   \text{den} = 2 \cdot C \cdot C
   \]
   This formula seems to be derived from the problem's requirements, but it needs to be verified against the expected mathematical derivation.

5. **GCD and Modular Inverse**: The program correctly uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction and then computes the modular multiplicative inverse of the denominator. This is necessary for calculating the final result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

6. **Final Result**: The program computes the final result as:
   \[
   \text{ans} = \left( \frac{\text{num}}{\text{den}} \right) \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   and prints it.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used for the expected value calculation. The formula should be derived from the problem's requirements, and it seems that the current formula might not be correct. Specifically, the term \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \) might not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Given the complexity of the problem, the formula should be re-evaluated to ensure it correctly captures the expected value. The correct formula should consider the probability of selecting each pair and how the friendship values evolve over the excursions.

Therefore, based on the current implementation and the potential issue with the formula, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
