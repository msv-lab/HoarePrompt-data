To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `p`. The loop will execute if `p` is greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is 0
- `i` is `p-1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`
- `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

For the loop to execute, we need:
- `p` to be greater than 0
- `i` to start from 0

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is 0, `i` is 0, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**
