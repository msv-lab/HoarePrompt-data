The value of `num` is updated by performing integer division (`//`) with `g`. This means `num` is now `num // g`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
