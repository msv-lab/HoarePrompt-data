The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop is iterating a certain number of times without using the loop variable directly. The loop iterates `T` times, and since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, it does not need to be adjusted.

However, the state of `T` needs to be considered because the loop's continuation depends on `T`. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is greater than 0, and it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than 0 before the start of the next iteration.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `T` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and thus not directly affected by the loop's iteration mechanism.

State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**.
