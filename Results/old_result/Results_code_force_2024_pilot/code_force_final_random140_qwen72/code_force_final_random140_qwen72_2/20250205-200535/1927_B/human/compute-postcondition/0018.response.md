Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 â‰¤ a_i < n. It returns a string `res` where each character is determined by the count of occurrences of each integer in `a`, mapped to characters from the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz' based on their position, with counts taken modulo 27. The final state of the program includes the returned string `res` and the internal state of the function (such as the dictionary `a_map`) is not accessible outside the function. **
