To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
- `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 1
- `res` is 'a'
- `beg` is 0

The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the start of the next iteration:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` was some value `k` (where `k < n`).
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `k + 1` (i.e., `n > k + 1`).

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 1, `res` is 'a', `beg` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`**.
