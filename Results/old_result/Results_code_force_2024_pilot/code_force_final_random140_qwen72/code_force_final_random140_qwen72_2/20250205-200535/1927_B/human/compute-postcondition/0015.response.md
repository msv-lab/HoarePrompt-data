Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `a`, `res` is a string composed of characters from `sam` based on the counts in `a_map` modulo 27, and the loop has completed all `n` iterations.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers, each satisfying the condition 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- `sam` remains the same string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'.
- `a_map` is updated such that each key (integer from 0 to n-1) maps to the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.
- `res` is constructed by appending characters from `sam` based on the current value of `a_map[a[i]] % 27` for each iteration of the loop.
- The loop has executed `n` times, once for each element in the list `a`.
