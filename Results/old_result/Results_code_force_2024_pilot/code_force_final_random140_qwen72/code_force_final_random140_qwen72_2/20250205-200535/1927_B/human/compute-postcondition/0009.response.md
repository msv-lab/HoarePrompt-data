The code snippet `res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` updates the value of `res` by appending a character from the string `sam`. The character appended is determined by the value of `a_map[a[i]] % 27`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
- `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 1
- `res` is 'a'
- `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 1]]`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `k + 1`

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `a_map[a[i]]` is the value in the dictionary `a_map` corresponding to the key `a[i]`.
2. Since `a_map[a[i]]` is 1 (as per the initial state), `a_map[a[i]] % 27` is `1 % 27`, which is 1.
3. The character at index 1 in the string `sam` is 'b'.
4. `res` is updated to `res + 'b'`, so `res` becomes 'ab'.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 1, `res` is 'ab', `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 1]]`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**
