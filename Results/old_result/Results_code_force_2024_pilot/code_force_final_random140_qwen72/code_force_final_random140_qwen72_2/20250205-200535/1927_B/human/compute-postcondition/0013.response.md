The code snippet `res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` updates the value of `res` by appending a character from the string `sam`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
   - `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n.
   - `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'.
   - `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 2.
   - `res` is 'ab'.
   - `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 2]]`.
   - `i` is `k + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `a_map[a[i]]` retrieves the value from the dictionary `a_map` at the key `a[i]`.
   - Since `a_map[a[i]]` is 2 (as per the initial state), the expression `a_map[a[i]] % 27` evaluates to `2 % 27`, which is 2.
   - `sam[2]` retrieves the character at index 2 from the string `sam`, which is 'c'.
   - `res` is updated by appending 'c' to its current value, resulting in `res` becoming 'abc'.

3. **Output State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
   - `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n.
   - `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'.
   - `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 2.
   - `res` is 'abc'.
   - `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 2]]`.
   - `i` is `k + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 2, `res` is 'abc', `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 2]]`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.**
