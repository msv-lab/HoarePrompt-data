Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, a)
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n.
def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
    a_map = {x: (0) for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
        
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `a`, `res` is a string composed of characters from `sam` based on the counts in `a_map` modulo 27, and the loop has completed all `n` iterations.
    return res
    #The program returns a string `res` composed of characters from the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz' based on the counts in `a_map` modulo 27, where `a_map` maps each integer from 0 to n-1 to the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. It returns a string `res` where each character is determined by the count of occurrences of each integer in `a`, mapped to characters from the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz' based on their position, with counts taken modulo 27. The final state of the program includes the returned string `res` and the internal state of the function (such as the dictionary `a_map`) is not accessible outside the function.
