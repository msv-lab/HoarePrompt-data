You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `a`, `res` is a string composed of characters from `sam` based on the counts in `a_map` modulo 27, and the loop has completed all `n` iterations.
    return res
    #The program returns a string `res` composed of characters from the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz' based on the counts in `a_map` modulo 27, where `a_map` maps each integer from 0 to n-1 to the count of occurrences of that integer in the list `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the trace values are very high, leading to an index out of range error in the string `sam`. The string `sam` contains only 26 characters (from 'a' to 'z'), but the program uses `a_map[a[i]] % 27` to index into `sam`, which means it will attempt to access `sam[26]` when `a_map[a[i]]` is 26, causing an index out of range error.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
0 1 26
```
The trace `[0, 1, 26]` indicates that the third character should appear 26 times before itself, which is impossible with only 26 unique lowercase letters. However, the program will attempt to access `sam[26]`, which is out of bounds.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the index used to access `sam` is always within the valid range (0 to 25). A simple fix would be to use `a_map[a[i]] % 26` instead of `a_map[a[i]] % 27`.
