Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 3, `res` is 'abc', `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 2]]`, `i` is `k + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a_map[a[i]]` by 1.
- Initially, `a_map[a[i]]` was 2 (as given in the initial state).
- After executing the code, `a_map[a[i]]` becomes 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
