The code snippet `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `a_map` by 1.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `a_map` is a dictionary where each integer from 0 to n-1 is initially mapped to 0, except for the keys corresponding to elements in the list `a`, which are mapped to 1.
- `i` is set to `k + 1`, and `a[i]` refers to the element in the list `a` at index `i`.
- The value of `a_map[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'.
- `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 1.
- `res` is 'ab'.
- `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 1]]`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

After executing the code:
- The value of `a_map[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `a_map[a[i]]` was initially 1, it is now 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 2, `res` is 'ab', `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 1]]`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**
