The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function returns a string `res` composed of characters from the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'. The characters in `res` are determined by the counts of each integer in the list `a` mapped to their respective positions in the alphabet string, with the counts taken modulo 27.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `res` where each character corresponds to the count of occurrences of each integer in `a`, mapped to characters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz' based on their position, with counts taken modulo 27.**
