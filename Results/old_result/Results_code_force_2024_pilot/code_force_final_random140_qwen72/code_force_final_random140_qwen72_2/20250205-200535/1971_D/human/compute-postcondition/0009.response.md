The value of `cut` is incremented by 1. If the first character of `a` is '1' and the second character of `a` is '0', `cut` was initially set to 1, so now `cut` is 2. Otherwise, `cut` was initially 0, so now `cut` is 1. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `i` is 1, if the first character of `a` is '1' and the second character of `a` is '0', then `cut` is 2. Otherwise, `cut` is 1.**
