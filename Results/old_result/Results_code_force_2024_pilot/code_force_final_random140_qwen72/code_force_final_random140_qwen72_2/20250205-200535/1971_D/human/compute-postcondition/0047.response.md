The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `s` is a string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function returns a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function returns a result based on the values of `t` and `s`.**
