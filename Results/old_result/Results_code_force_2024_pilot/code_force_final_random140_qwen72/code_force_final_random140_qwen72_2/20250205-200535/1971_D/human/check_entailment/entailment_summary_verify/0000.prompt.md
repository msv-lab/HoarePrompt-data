You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        print(cut + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings `s` each consisting of characters '0' and '1'. For each string, it calculates the number of occurrences of the substring "10" and prints this count plus one. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `a` is the last input string processed, `i` is the index of the second-to-last character of `a`, and `cut` is the number of occurrences of "10" in the last input string `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem of finding the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string. The logic in the program counts the transitions from '1' to '0' in the string, which directly corresponds to the number of cuts needed to separate the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Each transition represents a point where a cut is necessary to ensure that all '0's can be moved to the front and all '1's to the back. Adding 1 to the count of these transitions gives the total number of pieces required. This approach works for all possible binary strings, including edge cases like strings composed entirely of '0's or '1's, and strings that are already sorted. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
