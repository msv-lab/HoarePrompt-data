Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`, and then iterates through the string to count the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0'. This count represents the number of cuts needed to separate the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The final output is the number of cuts plus one, which accounts for the total number of pieces after making the cuts. This approach is correct according to the problem's requirements.
