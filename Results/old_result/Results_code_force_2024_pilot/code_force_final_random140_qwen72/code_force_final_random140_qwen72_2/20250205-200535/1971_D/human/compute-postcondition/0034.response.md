To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `a` is a new input string
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`
- `cut` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(a) - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `range(len(a) - 1)` produces a non-empty sequence. This means `len(a) - 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`a`**: The length of `a` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is redefined by the loop, so its initial value (`len(a) - 2`) does not affect the loop's execution. However, for clarity, we should note that `i` will start from 0 when the loop begins.

### Final State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `a` is a new input string with a length greater than 1
- `i` is 0 (as it will be set by the loop)
- `cut` is 0 (unchanged)

### State:
**`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a new input string with a length greater than 1, `i` is 0, `cut` is 0**
