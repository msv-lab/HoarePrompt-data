### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - `func_1` reads the input for a single test case.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Both functions handle invalid input formats by catching `ValueError`.

2. **Data Structures and Initialization:**
   - `n` and `k` are read from the input, representing the number of monsters and the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, respectively.
   - `a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster.
   - `b` is a list initialized to zero with length `n + 1`. This list is used to accumulate the total health of monsters at each distance from the player.

3. **Processing Monster Positions:**
   - For each monster, the absolute value of its position `x` is used to index into `b`, and the corresponding health `a[i]` is added to `b[abs(x)]`.
   - This step ensures that `b[i]` contains the total health of all monsters at distance `i` from the player.

4. **Simulation of Game Mechanics:**
   - A variable `r` is initialized to 0, representing the total number of bullets available.
   - For each distance `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - `r` is incremented by `k` (the number of bullets fired per second).
     - If `r` is less than `b[i]`, it means the player cannot kill all monsters at distance `i` before they reach the player, so the function prints 'NO' and returns.
     - Otherwise, `r` is decremented by `b[i]` to account for the bullets used to kill the monsters at distance `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', the function prints 'YES', indicating that the player can survive and kill all monsters.

### Correctness:
- The logic correctly simulates the game mechanics and checks if the player can survive and kill all monsters.
- The use of `b` to accumulate the total health of monsters at each distance is efficient and avoids unnecessary complexity.
- The function handles edge cases and invalid input formats appropriately.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
