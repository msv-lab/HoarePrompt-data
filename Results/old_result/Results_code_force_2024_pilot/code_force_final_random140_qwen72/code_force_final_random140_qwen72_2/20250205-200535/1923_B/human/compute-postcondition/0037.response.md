Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9. It also uses a list `b` initialized to zeros with length `n + 1`. The function returns different values based on the following cases:**

- **Case_1:** The function does not return any value.
- **Case_2:** The function returns the value of `r` calculated as `2 * k - b[2]`, where `b[2]` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to 2.
- **Case_3:** The function returns the value of `r` calculated as `3 * k - b[2] - b[3]`, where `b[2]` and `b[3]` are the sums of elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value of 2 and 3, respectively.
