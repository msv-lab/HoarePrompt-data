Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`, and for each index `j` in `b`, `b[j]` is the sum of all elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to `j`, `r` is `k`, and the current value of `r` is less than `b[i]`.**
