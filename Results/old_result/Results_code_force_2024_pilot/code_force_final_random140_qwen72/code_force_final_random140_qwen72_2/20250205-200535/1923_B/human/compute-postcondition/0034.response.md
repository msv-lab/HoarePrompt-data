To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `i` is initially set to `n`.
- `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`.
- For each index `j` in `b`, `b[j]` is the sum of all elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to `j`.
- `r` is calculated as `n * k - (sum of b[1] to b[n])`.
- If at any point during the loop `r` becomes less than `b[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and returns.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
   - `b[j]` is populated such that it contains the sum of all elements in `a` whose absolute value is `j`.

2. **Calculation of `r`**:
   - `r` is calculated as `n * k - (sum of b[1] to b[n])`.
   - This means `r` is the total number of operations allowed (`n * k`) minus the sum of all the sums stored in `b` from index 1 to `n`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates while `i` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration, `r` is checked against `b[i]`.
   - If `r` is less than `b[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and returns immediately.

4. **Final Print Statement**:
   - If the loop completes without printing 'NO', the program reaches the `print('YES')` statement.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('YES')` statement will only be reached if the loop completes without encountering the condition where `r` is less than `b[i]`.
- Therefore, if the loop completes without printing 'NO', the program will print 'YES'.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
