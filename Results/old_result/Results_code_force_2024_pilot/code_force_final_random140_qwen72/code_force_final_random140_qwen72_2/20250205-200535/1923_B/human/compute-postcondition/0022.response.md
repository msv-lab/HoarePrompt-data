Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`, and for each index `j` in `b`, `b[j]` is the sum of all elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to `j`, `r` is `2 * k - b[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated by adding `k` to its current value.
- Initially, `r` is `k - b[2]`.
- After the operation `r += k`, `r` becomes `k - b[2] + k`, which simplifies to `2 * k - b[2]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
