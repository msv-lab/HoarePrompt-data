A `ValueError` can occur when the `int()` function tries to convert the input into an integer but fails because the input is not a valid integer. This happens at the line `t = int(input())`.

The `try` block attempts to read an integer from the user input and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration. If the input is a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4), the loop will execute `t` times. However, if the input is not a valid integer, a `ValueError` is raised, and the program moves to the `except` block.

In the `except` block, the program prints 'Invalid input format' and the function terminates without executing the loop.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **If the input is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `t` is set to this integer, and the function calls `func_1()` `t` times. If the input is not a valid integer, the program prints 'Invalid input format' and terminates without executing the loop.**
