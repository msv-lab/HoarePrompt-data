The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` is now 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1**
