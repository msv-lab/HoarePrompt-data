The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have run at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented to 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2 for the loop condition to be true.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2**
