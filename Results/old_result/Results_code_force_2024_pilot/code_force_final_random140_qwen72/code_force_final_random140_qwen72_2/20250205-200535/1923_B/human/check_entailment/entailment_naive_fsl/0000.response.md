Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem states that each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers representing the health of the monsters, and the third line contains `n` integers representing the positions of the monsters. However, in `func_1`, the positions of the monsters are read one by one using a loop, which is incorrect. This will cause the program to fail when reading the input for multiple test cases.

Additionally, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game as described. The program incorrectly assumes that the positions of the monsters are always positive and uses `abs(x)` to index into the `b` array. This will not work correctly for negative positions, as the problem specifies that the positions can be negative.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
```
Input:
2
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
2 1
1 1
-1 1

Expected Output:
YES
NO

Actual Output:
NO
NO
```

In the first test case, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly handle the positions of the monsters. In the second test case, the program also outputs "NO" incorrectly for the same reason.
