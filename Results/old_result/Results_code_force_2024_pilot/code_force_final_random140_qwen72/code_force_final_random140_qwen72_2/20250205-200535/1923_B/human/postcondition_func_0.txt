The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It then reads `n` additional integers, each of which is used to update a list `b` of length `n + 1` by adding the corresponding element from `a` to `b[abs(x)]`. The function checks if the cumulative value `r` (initialized as 0 and incremented by `k` for each iteration) is sufficient to cover the values in `b` at each step. If at any point `r` is less than `b[i]`, the function prints 'NO' and returns. If the loop completes without this condition being met, the function prints 'YES'. In case of invalid input, the function prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value explicitly, but its primary purpose is to determine and print whether the condition `r >= b[i]` holds true for all `i` in the range 1 to `n`.
