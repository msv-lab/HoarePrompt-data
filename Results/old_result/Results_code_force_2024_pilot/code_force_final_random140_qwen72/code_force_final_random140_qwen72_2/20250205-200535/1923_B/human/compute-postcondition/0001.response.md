The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, it ensures that `t` is at least 1, making the loop executable.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 0 (the loop counter starts from 0)**
