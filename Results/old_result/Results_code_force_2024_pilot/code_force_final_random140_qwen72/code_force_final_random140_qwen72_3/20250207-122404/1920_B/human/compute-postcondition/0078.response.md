Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. The variable `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: Remains a reversed list of integers.
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`_`**: Remains a placeholder.
- **`n`, `k`, `x`**: Remain the integers read from the input.
- **`sum1`**: Remains the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- **`ans`**: Contains `k + 1` elements, where each element represents the value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop.
  - The first element is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
  - Subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions:
    - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
    - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` is `k + 1`.
- **`k`**: Remains at least 0.
