Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is further updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` remains `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
