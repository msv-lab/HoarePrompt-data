Output State: **`sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` contains the new value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. All other conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `sums` to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- Since `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, the condition for updating `sums` in this way is satisfied.
- After updating `sums`, the new value of `sums` is added to the list `ans`.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
