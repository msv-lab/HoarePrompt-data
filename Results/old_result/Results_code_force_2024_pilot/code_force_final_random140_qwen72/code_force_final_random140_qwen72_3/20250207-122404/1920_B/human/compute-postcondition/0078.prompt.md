Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is now a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` (where `a` is now reversed). For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` (using the reversed `a`). If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1]` (using the reversed `a`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, `k` is at least 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i == 0`, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1` and the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i != 0`, the first element of `ans` is the initial value of `sums`, and the second element is the current value of `sums`. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing three elements. If `i == 0`, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1`, the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and the third element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i != 0`, the first element of `ans` is the initial value of `sums`, the second element is the current value of `sums`, and the third element is the current value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to continue.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
