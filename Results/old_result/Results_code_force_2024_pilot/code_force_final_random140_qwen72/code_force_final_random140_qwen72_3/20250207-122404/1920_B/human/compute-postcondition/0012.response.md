Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `k` must be at least 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
