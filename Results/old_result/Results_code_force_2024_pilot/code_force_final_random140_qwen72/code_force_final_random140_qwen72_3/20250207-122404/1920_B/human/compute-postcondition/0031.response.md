The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, where `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, and `a[:x + 1]` is a slice of the first `x + 1` elements of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is a placeholder
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `k` is at least 0
- `i` is less than `k + 1`
- `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`

After executing the code:
- The list `ans` now includes the value of `sums` as its last element.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list with `sums` appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, `i` is less than `k + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
