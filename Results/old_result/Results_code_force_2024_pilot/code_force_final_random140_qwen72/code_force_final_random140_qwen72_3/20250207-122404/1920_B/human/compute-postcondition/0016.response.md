The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` from the list `a`. Since `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, the element at index `i - 1` is one of the elements in this list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `k` must be at least 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
