Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `k` must be at least 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.** 

The value of `sums` is incremented by the value of `a[i - 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
