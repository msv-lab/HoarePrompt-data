The code snippet `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is a placeholder
- The input is `t` (which must be a positive integer)

After executing the code snippet, the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.**
