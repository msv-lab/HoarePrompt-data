The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is now sorted in non-increasing order.
- `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing one element which is the updated value of `sums`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` must be at least the new value of `i`.
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- If `i == 1`, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- If `i > 1` and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- If `i > 1` and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

After executing `ans.append(sums)`, the value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the updated value of `sums` before the append operation and the second element is the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be at least the new value of `i`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` (or `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i == 1`, or `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i > 1` and `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i > 1` and `i + x - 1 >= n`).**
