The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a reversed list of integers.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `i` is not 0.
- `k` is at least 0.
- `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `sums` is added to the list `ans`.
- The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `sums`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, `k` is at least 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
