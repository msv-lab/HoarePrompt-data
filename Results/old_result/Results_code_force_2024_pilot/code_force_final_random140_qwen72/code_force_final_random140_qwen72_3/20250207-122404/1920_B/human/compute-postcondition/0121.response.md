Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by four parameters: `n`, `k`, `x`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, `n` represents the number of elements in the array `a`, `k` is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove from the array, and `x` is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the given information.**
