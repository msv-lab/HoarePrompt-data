Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, `i` is less than `k + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sums` is assigned the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `a[:x + 1]` is a slice of the list `a` from the start up to (and including) the `x`-th element.
- `sum(a[:x + 1])` calculates the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of the list `a`.
- `2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` doubles this sum.
- `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` subtracts this doubled sum from `sum1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.
