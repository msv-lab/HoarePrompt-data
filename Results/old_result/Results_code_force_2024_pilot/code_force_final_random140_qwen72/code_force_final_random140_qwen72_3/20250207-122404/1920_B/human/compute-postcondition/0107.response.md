Postcondition: ***`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the updated value of `sums` and the second element is the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be at least the new value of `i`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.***
