Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i == 1`, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1` and the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i != 1`, the first element of `ans` is the initial value of `sums`, and the second element is the current value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. `i` is now `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to continue.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `i + x - 1 < n` is assumed to be true for this update to occur. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the update would be different, but since the code specifically uses `a[i + x - 1]`, we assume the condition holds.
- The loop continues as long as `i < k + 1`.
