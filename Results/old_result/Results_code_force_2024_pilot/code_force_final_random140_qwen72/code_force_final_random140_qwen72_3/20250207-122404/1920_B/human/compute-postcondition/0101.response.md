The code snippet updates the value of `sums` based on the initial conditions and the provided formula. Here's the detailed calculation:

- `sums` is initially set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original array `a`.
- `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a[:x + 1]` is the first `x + 1` elements of the sorted array `a`.

Given these conditions, the value of `sums` is calculated as follows:
- `sum1` remains unchanged.
- `sum(a[:x + 1])` is the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of the sorted array `a`.
- `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.

The other variables (`a`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the updated value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be at least the new value of `i`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
