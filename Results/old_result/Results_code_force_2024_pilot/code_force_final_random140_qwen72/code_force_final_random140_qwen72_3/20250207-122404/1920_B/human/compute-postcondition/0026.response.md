The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is a placeholder
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `k` is at least 0
- If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`
- If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains one element which is the value of `sums`
- If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` contains this new value of `sums`
- If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` contains this new value of `sums`

After executing the code snippet `ans.append(sums)`, the value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is at least 0. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains one element which is the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` contains this new value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` contains this new value of `sums`.**
