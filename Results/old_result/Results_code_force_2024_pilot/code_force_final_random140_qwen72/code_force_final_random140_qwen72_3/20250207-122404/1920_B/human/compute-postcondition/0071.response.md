Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing three elements. The first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1` if `i == 1` or the initial value of `sums` if `i != 1`, the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and the third element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, and `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
