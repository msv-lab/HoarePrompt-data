The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, this condition remains true after the increment. All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` contains the new value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. All other conditions remain unchanged.**
