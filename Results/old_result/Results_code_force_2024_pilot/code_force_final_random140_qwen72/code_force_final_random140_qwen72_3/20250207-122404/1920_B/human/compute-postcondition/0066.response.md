The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the value of `sum1`, and the second element is the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and possibly further adjusted based on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`.**
