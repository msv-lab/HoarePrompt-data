Output State: **`a` is now a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` (where `a` is now reversed). For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` (using the reversed `a`). If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1]` (using the reversed `a`).**
