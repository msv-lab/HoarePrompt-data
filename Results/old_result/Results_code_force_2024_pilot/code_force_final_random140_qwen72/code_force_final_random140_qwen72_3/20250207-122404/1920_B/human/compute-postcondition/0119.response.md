To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-increasing order.
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the context of this problem).
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original list `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each element representing the updated value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop.
- `i` starts at `k + 1`.
- `k` is at least `k`.

### Loop Logic:
1. **Initialization:**
   - If `i == 0`, `sums` is initially set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.

2. **Iteration:**
   - For each subsequent iteration:
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Explanation:
- The list `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` at different stages of the loop.
- The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value from the list `ans`.

### Final Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`, which contains the updated values of `sums` at each iteration of the loop.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list containing k + 1 elements, each representing the updated value of sums at each iteration of the loop)**
