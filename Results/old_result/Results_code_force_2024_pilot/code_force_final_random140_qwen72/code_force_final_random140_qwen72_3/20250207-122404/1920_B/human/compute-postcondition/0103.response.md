Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the updated value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be at least the new value of `i`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) retain their previous values or conditions.
- The condition that `k` must be at least the new value of `i` remains valid.
