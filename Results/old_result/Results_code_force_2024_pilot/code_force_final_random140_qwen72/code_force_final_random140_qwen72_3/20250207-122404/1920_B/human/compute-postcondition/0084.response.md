Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` was sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., from smallest to largest).
- After reversing, `a` is now sorted in non-increasing order (i.e., from largest to smallest).
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.
