Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i == 1`, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1` and the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i != 1`, the first element of `ans` is the initial value of `sums`, and the second element is the current value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0. `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the variable `sums` to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- The initial state of `a`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, and `ans` remains unchanged.
- The value of `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the code snippet only updates `sums`, the increment of `i` is not reflected in this output state.
