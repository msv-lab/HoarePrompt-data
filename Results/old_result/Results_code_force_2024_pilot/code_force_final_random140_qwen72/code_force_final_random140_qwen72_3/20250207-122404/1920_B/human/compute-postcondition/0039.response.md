To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements.
- `i` is initialized to `k + 1`.
- `k` is at least 0.

### List Initialization:
- The first element in `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`):
  - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1]`.

### Explanation:
1. **First Element Calculation:**
   - The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
   - This means the first element is the total sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of `a`.

2. **Subsequent Elements Calculation:**
   - For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`):
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is `sum1 + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is `sum1 + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Value:**
   - The `max(ans)` function will find the maximum value among all the elements in the list `ans`.

### Final Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the maximum element in `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value calculated according to the given conditions.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements calculated based on the given conditions)**
