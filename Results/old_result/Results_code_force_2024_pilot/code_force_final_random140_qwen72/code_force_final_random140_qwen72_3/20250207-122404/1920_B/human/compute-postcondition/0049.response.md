The code calculates the value of `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of the reversed list `a` from `sum1`. 

- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original list `a`.
- `a` is a reversed list of integers.
- `x` is an integer read from the input.
- The slice `a[:x + 1]` includes the first `x + 1` elements of the reversed list `a`.

Let's calculate the new value of `sums`:

1. `sum(a[:x + 1])` computes the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of the reversed list `a`.
2. `2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` doubles this sum.
3. `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` subtracts this doubled sum from `sum1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
