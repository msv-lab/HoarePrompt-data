Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.** 

The list `a` was initially sorted in ascending order, and after executing the `reverse()` method, it is now sorted in descending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
