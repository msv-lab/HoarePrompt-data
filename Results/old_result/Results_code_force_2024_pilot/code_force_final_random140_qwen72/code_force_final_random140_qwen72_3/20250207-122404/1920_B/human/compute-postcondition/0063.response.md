Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The values of `a`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains at least 0. The new value of `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
