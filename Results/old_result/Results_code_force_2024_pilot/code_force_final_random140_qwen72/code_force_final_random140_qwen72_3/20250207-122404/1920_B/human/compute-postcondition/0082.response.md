Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` was a reversed list of integers, but after executing the code, `a` is now a list of integers input by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
