Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `sum1 = sum(a)` updates the value of `sum1` to be the sum of the elements in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is still within the specified range, and the inputs `n`, `k`, and `x` retain their original values. The list `ans` still contains `k + 1` elements, and `i` remains `k + 1`.
