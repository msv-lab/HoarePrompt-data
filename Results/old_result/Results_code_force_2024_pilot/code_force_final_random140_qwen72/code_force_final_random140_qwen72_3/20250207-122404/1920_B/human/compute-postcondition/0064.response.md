The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `a`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `i`, and the condition that `k` is at least 0 remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `sums`.

Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the initial value of `sums` and the second element is the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
