Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, `xor` is 0. The bitwise right shift of `xor` by `bit` positions results in a value where the least significant bit is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `xor` was initially set to the first element of `cur_arr`.
- The code snippet sets `xor` to 0.
- All other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that the bitwise right shift of `xor` by `bit` positions results in a value where the least significant bit is 0 is still valid because shifting 0 by any number of positions results in 0, which has its least significant bit as 0.
