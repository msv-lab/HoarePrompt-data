Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, reading the necessary inputs (n, x, and the array).

2. **Function Call**: For each test case, the program calls `func_1(arr, x)`, which is expected to compute the maximum number of segments that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`. The choice of 30 is appropriate because the problem specifies that \(0 \le x < 2^{30}\), meaning the highest bit position to consider is 29 (0-indexed).

4. **Function `find_new`**:
   - **Base Case**: When `bit` is -1, the function returns the length of `cur_arr`. This is correct because it indicates that all bits have been processed, and the length of `cur_arr` represents the number of valid segments.
   - **XOR Calculation**: The function iterates through `cur_arr`, maintaining a running XOR (`xor`). If the current bit (determined by `bit`) of the running XOR is 0, the current XOR is appended to `new_arr`, and `xor` is reset to 0. This ensures that the segments being considered do not set the current bit in the final OR result.
   - **Recursive Calls**:
     - If the current bit of `xor` is 1, `thing1` is set to -1, indicating that no valid segment can be formed at this bit level.
     - If the current bit of `x` is 1, the function returns the maximum of `thing1` and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. This is correct because if `x` allows the current bit to be set, we should consider both possibilities: including the current bit or not.
     - If the current bit of `x` is 0 and `thing1` is not -1, the function recursively calls `find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)`. This is correct because if `x` does not allow the current bit to be set, we must ensure that the current bit is not set in the final OR result.
     - If neither condition is met, the function returns -1, indicating that no valid segments can be formed.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `x` is 0 or when the array has only one element.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
