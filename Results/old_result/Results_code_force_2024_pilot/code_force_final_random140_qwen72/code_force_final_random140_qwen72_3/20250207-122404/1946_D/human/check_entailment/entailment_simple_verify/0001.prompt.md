You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Each segment must start from the beginning of the array and end at the end of the array, with no gaps between segments.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**: This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`. The choice of `30` is because the problem constraints state that `0 ≤ x < 2^30`, meaning `x` can have up to 30 bits.
   - **`find_new(cur_arr, bit)`**: This function recursively processes the array to find the maximum number of valid segments.

3. **Recursive Function `find_new`:**
   - **Base Case**: If `bit == -1`, it means we have processed all bits, and the length of the current array (`cur_arr`) is returned as the number of valid segments.
   - **Bit Processing**:
     - A new array `new_arr` is created to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit.
     - `xor` is used to accumulate the XOR of elements in the current segment.
     - If the current bit of `xor` is not set (`not xor >> bit & 1`), the segment is valid, and `xor` is appended to `new_arr`.
     - If the current bit of `xor` is set, the segment is invalid, and `thing1` is set to `-1`.
   - **Recursion**:
     - If the current bit of `x` is set (`x >> bit & 1`), we consider both the valid and invalid segments and return the maximum.
     - If the current bit of `x` is not set and `thing1` is not `-1`, we only consider the valid segments.
     - If neither condition is met, return `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function correctly processes the array by checking each bit from the most significant to the least significant.
   - It ensures that the segments are valid by checking the current bit of the XOR result.
   - The recursion handles the different cases (valid and invalid segments) and returns the maximum number of valid segments.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of valid segments based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
