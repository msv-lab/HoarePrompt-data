The code appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Since `xor` was initially set to `cur_arr[0]`, the first element of `cur_arr` is added to `new_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, `xor` is `cur_arr[0]`. The bitwise right shift of `xor` by `bit` positions results in a value where the least significant bit is 0.**
