Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`. Additionally, the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0.**
