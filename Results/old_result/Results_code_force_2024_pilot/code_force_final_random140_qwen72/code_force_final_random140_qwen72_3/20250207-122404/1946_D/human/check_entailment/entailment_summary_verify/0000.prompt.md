You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_new(arr, 30)

#Function 2:
def find_new(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = len(new_arr)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(thing1, find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1))
    elif thing1 != -1:
        return find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)
    return -1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_new` takes a list of non-negative integers (`cur_arr`) and an integer (`bit`) such that 0 <= bit < 30. It processes the list to determine the length of a new list (`new_arr`) that contains elements from `cur_arr` which, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the `bit`-th bit is 0. The function returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it recursively evaluates the list by considering the `bit`-th bit and the (bit - 1)-th bit, returning the maximum length found or -1 if no valid elements are found.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here’s a breakdown of why the solution works:

1. **Bitwise Analysis**: The function `find_new` iterates over the bits of the numbers in the array, starting from the most significant bit (MSB) down to the least significant bit (LSB). This approach ensures that the algorithm considers the impact of each bit position on the final result.

2. **Segmentation**: For each bit position, the function `find_new` attempts to segment the array into subarrays where the XOR of each subarray does not set the current bit. This is done by maintaining a running XOR (`xor`) and appending the current XOR to `new_arr` whenever the current bit is not set.

3. **Recursion**: The function recursively processes the segmented arrays for the next lower bit. This ensures that the algorithm checks all possible segmentations for all bit positions.

4. **Base Case**: When the bit position reaches -1, the function returns the length of the current array, which represents the number of valid segments found.

5. **Handling Constraints**: The function correctly handles the constraints by ensuring that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments does not exceed the given limit `x`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where no valid segmentation is possible by returning -1.

Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed implementation, the solution appears to cover all potential cases and edge conditions as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
