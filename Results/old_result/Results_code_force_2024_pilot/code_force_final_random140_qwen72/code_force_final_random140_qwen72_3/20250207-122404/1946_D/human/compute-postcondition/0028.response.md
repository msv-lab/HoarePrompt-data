Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `thing1` and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. `thing1` is either -1 or the length of `new_arr`, depending on whether the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1 or 0, respectively. The result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is the output of the function `find_new` when called with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1`.**
