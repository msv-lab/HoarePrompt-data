Output State: **The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Here, `new_arr` is a list containing elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0. The value of `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1. The function `find_new` is called with `bit - 1`, which means the next call will consider the (bit - 1)-th bit.**
