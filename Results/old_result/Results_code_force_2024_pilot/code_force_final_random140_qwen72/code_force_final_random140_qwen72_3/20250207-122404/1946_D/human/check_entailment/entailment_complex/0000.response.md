Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**: This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`. The choice of 30 is because the problem specifies that the elements of `arr` and `x` are less than \(2^{30}\), meaning they can be represented using 30 bits.
   - **`find_new(cur_arr, bit)`**: This function processes the array to find the maximum number of segments by recursively checking each bit position from the most significant bit (30) to the least significant bit (0).

3. **Recursive Logic**:
   - The function `find_new` starts with the highest bit (30) and checks if the current segment can be split into valid segments.
   - If the current bit is not set in `x`, it tries to form segments where the current bit is not set in the XOR result.
   - If the current bit is set in `x`, it considers both the possibility of forming segments where the current bit is not set and where it is set.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the next lower bit until it reaches the least significant bit (0).

4. **Base Case**:
   - When `bit` becomes -1, the function returns the length of the current array, which represents the number of valid segments found.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no valid segments can be formed by returning -1.
   - The function correctly processes the input and ensures that the constraints are met.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `find_new` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments.
   - The recursive approach ensures that all possible segmentations are considered.
   - The base case and edge cases are handled appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
