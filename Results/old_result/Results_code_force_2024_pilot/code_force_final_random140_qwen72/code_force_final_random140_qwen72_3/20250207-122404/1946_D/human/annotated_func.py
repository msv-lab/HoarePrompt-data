#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, both within the range [0, 2^30 - 1]. It returns the result of calling the function `find_new` with `arr` and 30 as arguments. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `find_new`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `x`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_new` takes a list of non-negative integers (`cur_arr`) and an integer (`bit`) such that 0 <= bit < 30. It processes the list to determine the length of a new list (`new_arr`) that contains elements from `cur_arr` which, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the `bit`-th bit is 0. The function returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it recursively evaluates the list by considering the `bit`-th bit and the (bit - 1)-th bit, returning the maximum length found or -1 if no valid elements are found.
