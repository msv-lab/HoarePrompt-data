The code `new_arr.append(xor)` adds the value of `xor` to the end of the list `new_arr`. Given the initial state, `xor` is the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`, and `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.

- `cur_arr` remains unchanged.
- `bit` remains unchanged.
- `new_arr` now contains the first element of `cur_arr` and the value of `xor`.
- `xor` is the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`.
- `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and the value of `xor`, `xor` is the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`, and `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
