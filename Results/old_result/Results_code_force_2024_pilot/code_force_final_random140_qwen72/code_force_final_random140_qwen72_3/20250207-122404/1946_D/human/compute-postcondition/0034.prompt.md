You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, and bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
```
def find_new(cur_arr, bit):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between `thing1` and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. `thing1` is either -1 or the length of `new_arr`, depending on whether the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1 or 0, respectively. The result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is the output of the function `find_new` when called with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1`.

Case_3: The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Here, `new_arr` is a list containing elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0. The value of `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1. The function `find_new` is called with `bit - 1`, which means the next call will consider the (bit - 1)-th bit.

Case_4: The program returns -1.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
