Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit-th bit of `xor` (the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`) is 0, then `new_arr` also contains the value of `xor`, and `xor` is 0. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.***
