You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, and bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
def find_new(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers.
    #State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, and bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not -1
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0, and `xor` is 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = len(new_arr)
    #State: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0, `xor` is 0. If the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(thing1, find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1))
        #The program returns the maximum value between `thing1` and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. `thing1` is either -1 or the length of `new_arr`, depending on whether the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1 or 0, respectively. The result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is the output of the function `find_new` when called with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1`.
    else :
        if (thing1 != -1) :
            return find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)
            #The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Here, `new_arr` is a list containing elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0. The value of `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1. The function `find_new` is called with `bit - 1`, which means the next call will consider the (bit - 1)-th bit.
        #State: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0, `xor` is 0. The bit-th bit of `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`. Additionally, `thing1` is -1.
    #State: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0, `xor` is 0. The bit-th bit of `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`. Additionally, `thing1` is -1.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `find_new` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, a list of non-negative integers, and `bit`, an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between `thing1` and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. `thing1` is either -1 or the length of `new_arr`, depending on whether the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1 or 0, respectively. The result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is the output of the function `find_new` when called with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1`.

Case_3: The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Here, `new_arr` is a list containing elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0. The value of `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1. The function `find_new` is called with `bit - 1`, which means the next call will consider the (bit - 1)-th bit.

Case_4: The program returns -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
