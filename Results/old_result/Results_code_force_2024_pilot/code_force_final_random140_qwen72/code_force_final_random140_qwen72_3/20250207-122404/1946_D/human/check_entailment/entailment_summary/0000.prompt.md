Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr, k))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_new(arr, 30)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, both within the range [0, 2^30 - 1]. It returns the result of calling the function `find_new` with `arr` and 30 as arguments. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `find_new`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `x`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_new(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = len(new_arr)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(thing1, find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1))
    elif thing1 != -1:
        return find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `find_new` takes a list of non-negative integers (`cur_arr`) and an integer (`bit`) such that 0 <= bit < 30. It processes the list to determine the length of a new list (`new_arr`) that contains elements from `cur_arr` which, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the `bit`-th bit is 0. The function returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it recursively evaluates the list by considering the `bit`-th bit and the (bit - 1)-th bit, returning the maximum length found or -1 if no valid elements are found.
