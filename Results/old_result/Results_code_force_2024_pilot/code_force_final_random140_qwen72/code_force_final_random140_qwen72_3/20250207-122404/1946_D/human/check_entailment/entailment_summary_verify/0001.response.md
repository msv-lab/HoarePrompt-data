### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Each segment must start from the beginning of the array and end at the end of the array, with no gaps between segments.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**: This function simply calls `find_new(arr, 30)`. The choice of `30` is appropriate because the problem constraints state that `0 â‰¤ x < 2^30`, meaning `x` can have up to 30 bits.
   - **`find_new(cur_arr, bit)`**: This function recursively processes the array to find the maximum number of valid segments.

3. **Recursive Function `find_new`:**
   - **Base Case**: If `bit == -1`, it means we have processed all bits, and the length of the current array (`cur_arr`) is returned as the number of valid segments.
   - **Bit Processing**:
     - A new array `new_arr` is created to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit.
     - `xor` is used to accumulate the XOR of elements in the current segment.
     - If the current bit of `xor` is not set (`not xor >> bit & 1`), the segment is valid, and `xor` is appended to `new_arr`.
     - If the current bit of `xor` is set, the segment is invalid, and `thing1` is set to `-1`.
   - **Recursion**:
     - If the current bit of `x` is set (`x >> bit & 1`), we consider both the valid and invalid segments and return the maximum.
     - If the current bit of `x` is not set and `thing1` is not `-1`, we only consider the valid segments.
     - If neither condition is met, return `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function correctly processes the array by checking each bit from the most significant to the least significant.
   - It ensures that the segments are valid by checking the current bit of the XOR result.
   - The recursion handles the different cases (valid and invalid segments) and returns the maximum number of valid segments.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of valid segments based on the problem description. The recursive approach ensures that all possible segments are considered, and the conditions for validity are checked appropriately.

Final: **True**
