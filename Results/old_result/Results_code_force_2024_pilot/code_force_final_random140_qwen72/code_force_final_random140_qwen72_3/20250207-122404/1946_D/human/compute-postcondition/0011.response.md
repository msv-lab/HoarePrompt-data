To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1.
- `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`.
- `xor` is the first element of `cur_arr`.
- If the bitwise right shift of `xor` by `bit` positions results in a value where the least significant bit is 0, then `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in cur_arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in `cur_arr`.
- The state of `cur_arr` does not change between iterations; it remains the same list.
- The variable `i` takes the value of the next element in `cur_arr` at the start of each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element of `cur_arr`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `cur_arr`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `cur_arr` remains unchanged.
- The state of `i` is updated to the next element in `cur_arr`.

### Final State:
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, `xor` is the first element of `cur_arr`, and `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`**.
