Functionality: ** The function `find_new` takes a list of non-negative integers (`cur_arr`) and an integer (`bit`) such that 0 <= bit < 30. It processes the list to determine the length of a new list (`new_arr`) that contains elements from `cur_arr` which, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the `bit`-th bit is 0. The function returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it recursively evaluates the list by considering the `bit`-th bit and the (bit - 1)-th bit, returning the maximum length found or -1 if no valid elements are found. **
