Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 4998, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer provided by the user, which is constrained to be between 1 and 50 inclusive. The other variables, `t` and `A`, remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while keeping the initial conditions of `t` and `A` intact.
