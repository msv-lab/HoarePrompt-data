The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, the new value of `n` must also fall within this range.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7**
