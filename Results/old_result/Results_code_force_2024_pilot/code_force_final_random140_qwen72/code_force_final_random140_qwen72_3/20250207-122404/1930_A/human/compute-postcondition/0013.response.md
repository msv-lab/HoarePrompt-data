The code snippet `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `A`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 4998
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `A` is a list of integers read from input

After executing the code:
- `A` is now a list of integers read from the input.

The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 4998, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of integers read from input.**
