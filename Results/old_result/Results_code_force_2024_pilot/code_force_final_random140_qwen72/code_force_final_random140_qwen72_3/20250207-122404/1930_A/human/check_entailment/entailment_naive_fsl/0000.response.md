Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply sums every other element in the list `A` starting from the first element, which is not the optimal strategy to maximize the score according to the problem description.

The correct approach to maximize the score is to sort the array and then sum the first `n` elements (since these will be the smallest elements, and thus the minimum values when paired). This ensures that the sum of the minimum values of each pair is maximized.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
2
3 1 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output from the given program:**
```
4
```

The expected output is 3 because the optimal way to pair the numbers is to pair 1 with 2 and 3 with 4, resulting in a score of 1 + 2 = 3. However, the given program outputs 4, which is incorrect.
