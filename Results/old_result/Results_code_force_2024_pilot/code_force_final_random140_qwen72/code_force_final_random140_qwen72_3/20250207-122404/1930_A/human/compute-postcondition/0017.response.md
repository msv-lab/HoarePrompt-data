The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the function should accept:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of pairs of integers.
  - A list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input. The specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function will return some form of result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
