Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. It then prints the sum of the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0. **
