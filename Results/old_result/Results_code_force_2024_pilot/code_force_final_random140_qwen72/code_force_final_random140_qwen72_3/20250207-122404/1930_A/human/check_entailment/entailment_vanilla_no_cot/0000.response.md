Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The solution prints the sum of every other element in the list `A`, which is not the correct approach to find the maximum score according to the problem's rules.

To solve this problem correctly, you should sort the list `A` and then take the sum of the first `n` elements. This is because, in each move, you want to maximize the minimum value between the two chosen numbers, and the optimal way to do this is to pair the smallest numbers together.

Here is the correct approach:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number `n`.
   - Read the list of `2n` integers.
   - Sort the list.
   - Sum the first `n` elements of the sorted list.
   - Print the result.

The correct implementation would look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[:n]))

func()
```

This ensures that you are always taking the smallest `n` elements, which gives you the maximum possible score.
