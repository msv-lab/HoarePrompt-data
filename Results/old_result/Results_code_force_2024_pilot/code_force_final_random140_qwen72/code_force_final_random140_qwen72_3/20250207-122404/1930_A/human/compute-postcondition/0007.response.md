Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which must be within the range 1 to 50. The other variables, `t` and `A`, remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
