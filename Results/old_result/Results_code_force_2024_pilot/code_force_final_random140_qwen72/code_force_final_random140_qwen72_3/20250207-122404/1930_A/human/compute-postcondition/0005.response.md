The value of `t` is decremented by 1, while the values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged. Since `t` was initially an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, after decrementing, `t` will now be an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 4999.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**
