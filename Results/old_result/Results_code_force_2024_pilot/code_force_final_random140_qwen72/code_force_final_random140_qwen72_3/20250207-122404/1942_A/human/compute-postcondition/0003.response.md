Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `k` is an input integer greater than 0.
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Multiplication**: The expression `'1 ' * n` creates a string where the character sequence `"1 "` is repeated `n` times. For example, if `n` is 3, the result would be `"1 1 1 "`.

2. **Slicing**: The `[:-1]` part removes the last character from the resulting string. This is because the last character is always a space, and we want to remove it to avoid trailing spaces. For example, if `n` is 3, the string `"1 1 1 "` becomes `"1 1 1"` after slicing.

3. **Print Statement**: The `print` function then outputs the modified string.

### Given the Initial State:
- Since `n` is equal to `k`, and both are input integers greater than 0, the value of `n` is a positive integer.
- Let's assume `n = k = 3` for illustration purposes. The same logic applies for any positive integer value of `n`.

### Calculation:
- If `n = 3`, the string `'1 ' * 3` results in `"1 1 1 "`.
- Removing the last character with `[:-1]` gives us `"1 1 1"`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output a string of `"1 "` repeated `n` times, with the trailing space removed.

Output: **1 1 1 (where the number of 1s is equal to the value of n)**

This format ensures that the output is clear and easily understandable, adhering to the given format.
