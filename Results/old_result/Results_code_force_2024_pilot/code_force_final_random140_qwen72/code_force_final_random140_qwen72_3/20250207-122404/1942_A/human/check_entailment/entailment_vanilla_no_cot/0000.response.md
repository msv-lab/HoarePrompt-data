Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly addresses the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Case `n == k`:**
   - If `n` equals `k`, then all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This can be achieved by having all elements of the array be the same. The code prints `1 1 ... 1` (n times), which ensures that every cyclic shift is sorted.

2. **Case `k == 1`:**
   - If `k` equals 1, then only one cyclic shift of the array should be sorted. This can be achieved by creating an array where the elements are in increasing order except for one element that breaks the order. The code prints the array `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).

3. **Other Cases:**
   - For all other cases, the code prints `-1`. This is because if `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, it is impossible to construct an array that meets the criteria of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

The logic and implementation are correct, and the solution handles all the specified cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
