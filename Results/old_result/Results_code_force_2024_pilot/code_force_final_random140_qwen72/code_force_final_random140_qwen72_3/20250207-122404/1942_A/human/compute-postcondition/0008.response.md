The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **-1**
