The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it seems the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3`, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`.

Given these constraints, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each one. Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume the function returns some form of result or results based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3`). It returns a result for each test case, with the total number of test cases `t` being an integer where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`.**
