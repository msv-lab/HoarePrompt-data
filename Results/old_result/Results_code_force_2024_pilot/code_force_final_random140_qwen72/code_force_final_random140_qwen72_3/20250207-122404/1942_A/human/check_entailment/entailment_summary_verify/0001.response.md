### Reasoning:

1. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**  
   - The function correctly handles the case where \( n = k \). In this scenario, all \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way to achieve this is by having all elements in the array be the same. The function prints a space-separated string of `n` ones, ensuring that every cyclic shift will be sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `1 1`.

2. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**  
   - The function correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \). Here, only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. The function prints a space-separated string of integers from 1 to \( n \). This ensures that the original array is sorted, but any other cyclic shift will not be sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the output is `1 2 3`.

3. **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**  
   - The function correctly handles the case where \( 1 < k < n \). In this scenario, it is impossible to construct an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. The function prints `-1` in this case, indicating that no such array exists.
   - Example: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly processes the input and produces the expected output for all specified cases. It handles the edge cases and the general case appropriately, ensuring that the output meets the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
