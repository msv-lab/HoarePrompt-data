Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to solve the problem of generating an array that meets the specified conditions regarding the number of sorted cyclic shifts. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly handles all the cases as per the problem statement:

1. **Case when `n == k`:**
   - If `n` equals `k`, the program prints a string of `n` ones. This is correct because an array of `n` identical elements will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted, thus satisfying the condition of having exactly `k` (which is equal to `n`) sorted cyclic shifts.

2. **Case when `k == 1`:**
   - If `k` equals 1, the program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. This is also correct because the only sorted cyclic shift of this array is the original array itself, and all other cyclic shifts will be unsorted due to the increasing order of the elements.

3. **Other cases:**
   - For any other combination of `n` and `k`, the program prints `-1`. This is correct because the problem specifies that there should be exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, and the only known configurations that satisfy this are when `n == k` (all shifts are sorted) or `k == 1` (only one shift is sorted).

The program handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem statement. It correctly outputs the required arrays or `-1` when no valid array exists.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
