Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0. If `n` == `k`, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `n` != `k`, and `k` == 1, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` > 1, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` also remain unchanged.***
