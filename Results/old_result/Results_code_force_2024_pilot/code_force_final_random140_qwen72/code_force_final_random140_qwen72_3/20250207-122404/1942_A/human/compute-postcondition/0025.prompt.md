Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; for each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if n == k:
        print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
    elif k == 1:
        print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
    else:
        print(-1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `k` is an input integer greater than 0. If `n` equals `k`, the program maintains the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`. If `n` does not equal `k`, and `k` is 1, the program does nothing. Otherwise, if `k` is not 1, the program maintains the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, and `k` is the second input integer greater than 0. If `n` == `k`, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `n` != `k`, and `k` == 1, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` also remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0. If `n` == `k`, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `n` != `k`, and `k` == 1, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` > 1, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
