You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; for each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        else:
            print(-1)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3`). For each test case, it prints a specific output based on the values of `n` and `k`:
- If `n` equals `k`, it prints a space-separated string of `n` ones.
- If `k` equals 1, it prints a space-separated string of integers from 1 to `n`.
- For any other values of `n` and `k`, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**  
   - If \( n = k \), it means all \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are equal. Therefore, the solution is to print an array where all elements are `1`. This ensures that every cyclic shift will be sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `1 1`.

2. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**  
   - If \( k = 1 \), it means only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. This can be achieved by creating an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order except for the last element, which is smaller than the first element. This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the output is `1 2 3` (or any other strictly increasing sequence followed by a smaller number).

3. **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**  
   - If \( 1 < k < n \), it is impossible to construct an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. This is because if more than one cyclic shift is sorted, the array must have a specific structure that cannot be easily generalized to produce exactly \( k \) sorted shifts without violating the constraints.
   - Therefore, the program correctly prints `-1` in this case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified cases and produces the expected output for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
