Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that meets specific conditions regarding its cyclic shifts being sorted. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the solution:

1. **Case when \( n = k \)**:
   - If the number of elements \( n \) is equal to the required number of sorted cyclic shifts \( k \), then the simplest solution is to create an array where all elements are the same. This ensures that every cyclic shift will be sorted because all elements are equal.
   - The program correctly prints a string of \( n \) ones, which is a valid solution.

2. **Case when \( k = 1 \)**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), we need exactly one cyclic shift to be sorted. One way to achieve this is to create an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order except for the last element, which is smaller than the first element. This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   - The program correctly prints a sequence of integers from 1 to \( n \), which is a valid solution.

3. **Other cases**:
   - For any other combination of \( n \) and \( k \), the problem states that there is no valid array that can meet the requirements. The program correctly prints `-1` in these cases.

Given the above reasoning, the program handles all specified cases correctly and follows the problem constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
