Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the first input integer greater than 0.
- `k` is the second input integer greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String Multiplication**: 
   - The expression `'1 ' * n` creates a string where the character sequence `"1 "` is repeated `n` times. For example, if `n = 3`, the result would be `"1 1 1 "`.

2. **Slicing**:
   - The expression `[:-1]` removes the last character from the resulting string. This is done to remove the trailing space. Continuing the example, if `n = 3`, the string `"1 1 1 "` becomes `"1 1 1"` after slicing.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` function then outputs the modified string.

### Final Output:
- The output will be a string consisting of `n` occurrences of the number `1`, separated by spaces, with no trailing space.

Output: **"1 1 1 ... 1" (where there are `n` occurrences of `1`, separated by spaces, and no trailing space)**
