Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is `m`, `res` is either the minimum value of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` for all valid `s` values calculated during the loop, or remains `inf` if no valid `s` was found.**

Explanation:
- The line `n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively.
- `n` and `m` are now integers greater than 0, and `k` is an integer read from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
