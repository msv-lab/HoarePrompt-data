Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the current input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `i` is `m`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `res` is the minimum value of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` computed during the loop, and `res` is equal to infinity (`inf`).**
