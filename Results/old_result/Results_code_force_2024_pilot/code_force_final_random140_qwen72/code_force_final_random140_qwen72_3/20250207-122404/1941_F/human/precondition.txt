t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of prepared problems, models, and functions, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 × 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}, representing the complexities of the prepared problems. d is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9, representing the complexities of the models. f is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9, representing the complexities of the functions.
