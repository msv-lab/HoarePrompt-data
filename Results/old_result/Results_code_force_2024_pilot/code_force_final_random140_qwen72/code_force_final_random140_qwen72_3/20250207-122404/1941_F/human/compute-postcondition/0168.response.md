Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `remain` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[0]`, and the `start < s < end` condition remains unchanged. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
