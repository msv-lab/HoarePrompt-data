Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `res` is set to infinity (`inf`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index in the sorted list `f` where the value `remain` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If `j != k` and `j >= 1`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If `j < 1`, no changes are made to `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 1, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index in the sorted list `f` where the value `remain` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, and `m` must be greater than 1. If `j == k`, and `start < s < end` where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[1]` if `j >= 1`, `res` is updated to `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If `j != k` and `j >= 1`, `s` is updated to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd). Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the index in the sorted list `f` where the value `remain` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, and `m` must be greater than 2. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[2]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))`. Otherwise, if `j != k`, `s` is `f[j] + b[2]` if `j < 1`, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[2]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
