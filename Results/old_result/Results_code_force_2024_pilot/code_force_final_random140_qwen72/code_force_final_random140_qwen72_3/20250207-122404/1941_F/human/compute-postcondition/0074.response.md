Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is a list of integers read from the current input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is `m`, `res` is either the minimum value of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` for all valid `s` values calculated during the loop, or remains `inf` if no valid `s` was found.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]` generates a new list `gap` where each element is a tuple `(y - x, x, y)` for consecutive elements `x` and `y` in the list `a`.
- This updates the value of `gap` to a list of tuples as described.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `res`) remain unchanged or are derived from the updated `gap` list as specified in the initial state.
