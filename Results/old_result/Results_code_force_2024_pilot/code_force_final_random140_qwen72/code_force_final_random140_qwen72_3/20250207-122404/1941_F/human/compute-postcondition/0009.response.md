Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is a list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2.** 

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `start` and `end` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
