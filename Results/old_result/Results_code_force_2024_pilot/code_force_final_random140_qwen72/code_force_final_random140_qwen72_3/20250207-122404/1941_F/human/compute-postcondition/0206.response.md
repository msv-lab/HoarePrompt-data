The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`, `m`, and `k`: Integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 * 10^5.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}.
  - `d`: A list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `f`: A list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a`, `d`, and `f`. It returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
