To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The state of `t` (the number of test cases) is already given as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases, `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The placeholder variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is just a counter for the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**.
