You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a`, `b`, and `f`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum possible maximum gap between elements in a modified list derived from `a` by inserting an element `s` such that `s` is the sum of an element from `b` and an element from `f`. The function prints the result for each test case, which is either the minimum maximum gap found or the largest gap in the original list `a` if no valid `s` is found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which matches the problem description.

2. **Gap Calculation**: It calculates the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list of problem complexities and sorts these gaps in descending order. This helps in identifying the largest gap, which is the primary focus for minimizing imbalance.

3. **Binary Search and Insertion**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate position for inserting a new problem complexity within the largest gap. It checks both the exact match and the closest lower value to ensure the best possible insertion point.

4. **Result Calculation**: For each model and function combination, it calculates the new imbalance and keeps track of the minimum imbalance found. If no valid insertion point is found, it prints the original largest gap.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there is only one gap or when no valid insertion point is found.

Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of various scenarios, the program seems to cover all potential cases and works as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
