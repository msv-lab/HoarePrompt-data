Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `mid - b[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[0]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k`, `s` is either `f[j] + b[0]` or `f[j - 1] + b[0]` depending on whether `j >= 1`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.**
