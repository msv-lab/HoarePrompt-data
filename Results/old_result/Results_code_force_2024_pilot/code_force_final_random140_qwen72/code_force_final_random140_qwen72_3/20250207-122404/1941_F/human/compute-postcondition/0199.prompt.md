Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the current input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `i` is `m`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `res` is now equal to infinity (`inf`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `remain` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[0]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k`, `s` is either `f[j] + b[0]` or `f[j - 1] + b[0]` depending on whether `j >= 1`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `start`, `end`, and `nd` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, and `j` is the index in `f` where `mid - b[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[1]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and `j >= 1`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[1]`, and `res` remains unchanged unless `start < s < end` is true, in which case `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and `j < 1`, `s` is `f[j] + b[1]`, and `res` remains unchanged unless `start < s < end` is true, in which case `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, and `j` is the index in `f` where `mid - b[2]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `j == k` and `start < s < end`, where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[2]`, then `res` is updated to the minimum value between the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j >= 1` and `start < s < end`, where `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[2]`, then `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. In all other cases, the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
