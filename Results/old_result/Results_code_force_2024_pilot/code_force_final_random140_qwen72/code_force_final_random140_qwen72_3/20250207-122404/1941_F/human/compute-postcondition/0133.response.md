To determine what will be printed by the `print(gap[0][0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the precondition:

1. **`gap`**: This is a sorted list of tuples in descending order. Each tuple is of the form `(y - x, x, y)` for consecutive elements `x` and `y` in the list `a`.

2. **`gap[0]`**: This is the first tuple in the `gap` list, which is the largest gap between consecutive elements in `a`.

3. **`gap[0][0]`**: This is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, which represents the largest difference `(y - x)` between consecutive elements in `a`.

Given this information, the `print(gap[0][0])` statement will print the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `a`.

Output: **largest difference between consecutive elements in the list `a`**
