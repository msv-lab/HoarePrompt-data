Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index in the sorted list `f` where the value `remain` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to `min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`.***
