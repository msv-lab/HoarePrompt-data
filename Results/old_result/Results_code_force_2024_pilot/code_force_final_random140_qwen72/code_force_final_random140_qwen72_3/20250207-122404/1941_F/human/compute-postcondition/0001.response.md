The code snippet `n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t`

After executing the code snippet, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
