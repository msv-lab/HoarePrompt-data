### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the list of integers and splits them into a list of strings.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list is sorted based on the length of the number after removing trailing zeros. This is done using `sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip('0')) - len(x))`.
   - The sorting key is `len(x.rstrip('0')) - len(x)`, which effectively sorts the numbers by their length after removing trailing zeros. However, this key is incorrect because it should be `len(x.rstrip('0'))` to sort by the length of the number without trailing zeros.

3. **Reversing and Concatenating**:
   - The function iterates over the sorted list and concatenates the numbers into a single string `rev_res`.
   - For even indices, it removes trailing zeros before concatenating.
   - For odd indices, it concatenates the number as is.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - After concatenating all the numbers, it checks if the length of the resulting string `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna".

### Issues:
- **Sorting Key**: The sorting key `len(x.rstrip('0')) - len(x)` is incorrect. It should be `len(x.rstrip('0'))` to correctly sort the numbers by their length after removing trailing zeros.
- **Concatenation Logic**: The logic for concatenating the numbers is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game rules where Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number and Sasha concatenates two numbers. Instead, it simply concatenates the numbers in a specific order.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Reverse the digits of each number in the list
        a = [int(str(x)[::-1]) for x in a]
        
        # Sort the list in descending order
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Concatenate the numbers
        result = ''.join(map(str, a))
        
        # Check the winning condition
        if len(result) >= m + 1:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: Same as before.
2. **Reverse Digits**: Each number in the list is reversed using `int(str(x)[::-1])`.
3. **Sort in Descending Order**: The list is sorted in descending order to maximize the concatenated result.
4. **Concatenate Numbers**: The numbers are concatenated into a single string.
5. **Winning Condition**: The length of the concatenated string is checked against `m + 1` to determine the winner.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
