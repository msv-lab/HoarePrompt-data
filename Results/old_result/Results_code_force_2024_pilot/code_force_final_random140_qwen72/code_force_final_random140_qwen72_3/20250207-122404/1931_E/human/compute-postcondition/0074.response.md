Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a threshold value. It constructs a string by concatenating the elements of the list, removing trailing zeros from elements at even indices. If the resulting string's length meets or exceeds the threshold plus one, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna". The function handles multiple test cases and outputs the result for each. **
