The code snippet `list_len, max_power = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. Since `input()` returns a string, both `list_len` and `max_power` will be strings.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `y` is 0
- `rev_res` is an empty string

After executing the code snippet, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `y` is 0
- `rev_res` is an empty string
- `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input
- `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input.**
