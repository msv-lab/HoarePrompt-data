The code snippet `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` appends to `rev_res` the string obtained by removing trailing zeros from the element at index `x` in `operational_list`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `y` is 0
- `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input and must be greater than 1 when converted to an integer
- `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input
- `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string
- `x` is 1
- If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string obtained by stripping trailing zeros from the first element of `operational_list`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the first element of `operational_list`.

Since `x` is 1 (odd), `rev_res` is initially the first element of `operational_list`. The code appends to `rev_res` the string obtained by removing trailing zeros from the element at index `x` (which is 1) in `operational_list`.

Let's denote the first element of `operational_list` as `op_list[0]` and the second element as `op_list[1]`. Since `x` is 1, the code appends `op_list[1].rstrip('0')` to `rev_res`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input and must be greater than 1 when converted to an integer, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 1, `rev_res` is `op_list[0] + op_list[1].rstrip('0')`**.
