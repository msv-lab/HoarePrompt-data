Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input and must be greater than 0 when converted to an integer, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 0. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string obtained by stripping trailing zeros from the first element of `operational_list`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the first element of `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input and must be greater than 1 when converted to an integer, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list` and the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros stripped. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first and second elements of `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input and must be greater than 2 when converted to an integer, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list`, the second element of `operational_list`, and the third element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros stripped. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list` and the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros stripped, followed by the third element of `operational_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
