Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input provided, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is now a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code sorts the `operational_list` based on the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros (`len(x.rstrip('0'))`) and the original length of the string (`len(x)`).
- The sorting operation updates the `operational_list` to reflect this new order.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `x`, and `rev_res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
