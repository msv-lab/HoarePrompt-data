Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input provided, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is now a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is the integer value of `list_len` - 1, `rev_res` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` must be greater than 0, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 0. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list` without trailing zeros. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` must be greater than 1, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list` without trailing zeros. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is greater than 2, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 2, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list` (without trailing zeros if `x` was initially even), and the third string in `operational_list` (without trailing zeros if `x` was initially even).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
