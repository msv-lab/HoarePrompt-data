Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input and must be greater than 1 when converted to an integer, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first element of `operational_list` and the second element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros stripped. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first and second elements of `operational_list`.***
