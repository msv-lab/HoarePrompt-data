Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `y`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power`.
- The code reads input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and sorts this list based on a custom key.
- The key used for sorting is the difference between the length of each string after removing trailing zeros (`len(x.rstrip('0'))`) and the original length of the string (`len(x)`).
- The resulting sorted list is stored in the variable `operational_list`.
