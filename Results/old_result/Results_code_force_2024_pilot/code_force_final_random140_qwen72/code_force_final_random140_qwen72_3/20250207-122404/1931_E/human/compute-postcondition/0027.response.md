The provided code snippet sorts the `operational_list` based on the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `x`, or `rev_res`. However, it updates the `operational_list` to be sorted according to the specified key.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input provided, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is now a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is the integer value of `list_len` - 1, `rev_res` is an empty string.**
