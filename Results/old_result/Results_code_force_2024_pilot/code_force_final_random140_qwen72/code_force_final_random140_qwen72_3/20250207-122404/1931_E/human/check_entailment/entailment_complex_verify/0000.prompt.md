You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, representing the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the list of integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is `t` - 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of all strings in `operational_list` where strings at even indices (0-based) have their trailing zeros removed, and strings at odd indices are concatenated as they are. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a threshold value. It constructs a string by concatenating the elements of the list, removing trailing zeros from elements at even indices. If the resulting string's length meets or exceeds the threshold plus one, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna". The function handles multiple test cases and outputs the result for each.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few specific issues and examples where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversal and Concatenation**:
   - The program reverses the digits of the numbers in a way that does not match the problem description. Specifically, it strips trailing zeros using `rstrip('0')` and concatenates the numbers directly. This does not simulate the actual game rules where Anna reverses a single number and Sasha concatenates two numbers.

2. **Incorrect Turn Logic**:
   - The program does not properly simulate the turn-based nature of the game. It simply alternates between adding the original and modified numbers to a string, which does not reflect the actual game mechanics.

3. **Incorrect Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks the length of the concatenated string against `max_power + 1`, which is not the correct condition. The game ends when there is exactly one number left, and the winning condition is whether this number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description:
- Anna can reverse the number 2, making it 2.
- Sasha can then concatenate 2 and 14, resulting in 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha wins.

However, the provided program will output:
```
Anna
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly simulate the game rules and the winning condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Simulate Anna's turn by reversing a single number.
2. Simulate Sasha's turn by concatenating two numbers.
3. Check the final number after all moves to determine the winner.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
