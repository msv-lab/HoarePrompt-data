The code snippet `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` appends the string from `operational_list` at index `x`, with trailing zeros removed, to `rev_res`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `y` is 1
- `list_len` must be greater than 1
- `max_power` is the second part of the input provided
- `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string
- `x` is 1
- If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list` without trailing zeros. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list`

Since `x` is 1 (odd), `rev_res` is initially the first string in `operational_list`. The code appends the string at index `x` (which is 1) from `operational_list`, with trailing zeros removed, to `rev_res`.

Let's assume the first string in `operational_list` is `s1` and the second string is `s2`. Since `x` is 1, `rev_res` is initially `s1`. The code appends `s2.rstrip('0')` to `rev_res`.

Therefore, the new value of `rev_res` is `s1 + s2.rstrip('0')`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` must be greater than 1, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 1, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list` without trailing zeros.**
