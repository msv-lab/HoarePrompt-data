Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is greater than 2, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 2, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list` (without trailing zeros if `x` was initially even), and the third string in `operational_list` (without trailing zeros if `x` was initially even).***
