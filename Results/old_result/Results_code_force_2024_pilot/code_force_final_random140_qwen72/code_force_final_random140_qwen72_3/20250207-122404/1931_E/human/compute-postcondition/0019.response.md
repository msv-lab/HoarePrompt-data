Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is the integer value of `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is a string formed by concatenating the elements of `operational_list` in such a way that for every even index `i`, the trailing zeros are stripped from the element at index `i`, and for every odd index `i`, the element is concatenated as is. Additionally, the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to the integer value of `max_power` plus one.**
