Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer greater than 2, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 2, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string and the second string in `operational_list`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the third string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is concatenated with the third string in `operational_list` without removing trailing zeros.***
