Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` must be greater than 0, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 0. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list` without trailing zeros. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list`.***
