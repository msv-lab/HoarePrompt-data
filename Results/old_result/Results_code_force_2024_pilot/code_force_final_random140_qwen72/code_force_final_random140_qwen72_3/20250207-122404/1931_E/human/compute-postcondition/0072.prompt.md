Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, representing the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the list of integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip(
        '0')) - len(x))
    for x in range(int(list_len)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
        else:
            rev_res += operational_list[x]
    if len(rev_res) >= int(max_power) + 1:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is the integer value of `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is a string formed by concatenating the elements of `operational_list` in such a way that for every even index `i`, the trailing zeros are stripped from the element at index `i`, and for every odd index `i`, the element is concatenated as is. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to the integer value of `max_power` plus one, the condition is met. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input provided, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of all strings in `operational_list` with every other string (starting from the first) having trailing zeros removed. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, then this condition holds true. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of all strings in `operational_list` where strings at even indices (0-based) have their trailing zeros removed, and strings at odd indices are concatenated as they are. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
