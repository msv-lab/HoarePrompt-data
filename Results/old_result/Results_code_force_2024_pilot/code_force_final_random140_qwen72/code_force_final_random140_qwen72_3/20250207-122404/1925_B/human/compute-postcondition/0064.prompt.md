Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are the integers provided by the new input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n`, `i` is `int(new x)`, the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is set to 1. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans`. `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, and `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and possibly the value `2`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i > k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans` and `2`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans` and `2`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `i > k`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans`, and `ans` is the same as before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, and `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0` and `i <= k`, `l` contains the value of `ans`, 3, and possibly `x // i` if `x // i <= k`. In this case, `ans` is the maximum of `ans`, 2, and `x // i` if `x // i <= k`; otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 2. If `x % i == 0` and `i > k`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and 3, and `ans` remains the same as before. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans` and 2, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
