Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing `[1, 2]`.** 

The value `2` has been appended to the list `l`, which now contains the elements `[1, 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
