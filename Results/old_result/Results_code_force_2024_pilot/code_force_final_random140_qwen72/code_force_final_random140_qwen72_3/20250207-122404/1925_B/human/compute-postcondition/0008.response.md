Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, `l` is [1, 1], and the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.** 

The list `l` now includes the value 1 appended to it, making `l` equal to [1, 1]. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
