Postcondition: ***`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, and `l` is a list. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is updated to contain `[1, 1, x // 1]`. Otherwise, `l` remains as `[1]`.***
