Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is set to 1. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans`. `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
