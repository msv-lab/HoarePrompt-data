Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input.
- `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.
- `i` is `int(x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`**: This variable is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). It is not directly used in the code snippet provided.
2. **Variables `x` and `n`**: These are integers provided by the input. They are used to compute `k`.
3. **Variable `k`**: This is the result of the integer division of `x` by `n`. In Python, this is computed using the `//` operator.
4. **Variable `i`**: This is the integer conversion of `x`. Since `x` is already an integer, `int(x)` will simply be `x`.
5. **Variable `ans`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet provided. Therefore, it is not clear what `ans` contains.

Given that `ans` is not defined, attempting to print `ans` will result in a `NameError` because `ans` is not a recognized variable in the current scope.

### Output:
Output: **NameError: name 'ans' is not defined**
