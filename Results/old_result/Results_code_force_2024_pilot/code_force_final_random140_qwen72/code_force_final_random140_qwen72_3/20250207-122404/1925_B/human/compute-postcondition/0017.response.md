The code snippet `l.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2 and `l` initially contains `[1]`, after executing this code, `l` will contain `[1, 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `l` is [1, 2].**
