Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, `l` is `[1, 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The list `l` initially contains `[1]`.
- The code appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `l`.
- After appending, `l` becomes `[1, 3]`.
- All other variables (`_`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.
