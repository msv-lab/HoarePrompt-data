Postcondition: ***`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1. If `x % i` is 0, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, where `l` is either `[1]` or `[1, 1, x // 1]` depending on whether `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.***
