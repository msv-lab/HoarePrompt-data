Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing `[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = [ans]` creates a new list `l` and assigns it the value `[1]`, because `ans` is 1.
- All other variables (`_`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `i` must be less than `int(x)` remains valid.
