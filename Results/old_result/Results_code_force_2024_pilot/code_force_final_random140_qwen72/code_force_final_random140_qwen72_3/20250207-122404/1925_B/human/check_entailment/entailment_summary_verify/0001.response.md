### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires dividing a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.
   - To maximize the GCD, we should consider the largest divisors of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the largest divisor that can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems by ensuring `i <= k` where `k = x // n`.
   - It also checks if `x // i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems by ensuring `x // i <= k`.
   - The program updates `ans` with the maximum valid divisor found.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly identifies the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The use of `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` ensures that all potential divisors are considered, including those just above the square root of `x`.
   - The logic for updating `ans` with the maximum valid divisor is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or `x` is a prime number correctly.
   - For `n = 1`, the GCD is simply `x`.
   - For `x` being a prime number, the GCD is 1 if `n > 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It efficiently checks all potential divisors and updates the answer accordingly. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: **True**
