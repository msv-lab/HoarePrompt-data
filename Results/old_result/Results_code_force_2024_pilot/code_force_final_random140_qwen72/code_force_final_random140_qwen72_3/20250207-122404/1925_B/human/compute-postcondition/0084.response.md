Postcondition: ***`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `l` contains `[1]`.***
