Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, and `l` is a list. If `i <= k`, `l` contains the value of `ans`, 3, and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i > k`, `l` contains the value of `ans`, 3, and 2, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` contains the value of `ans`, 3, and 2, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `i > k`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and 3, and `ans` is the same as before.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(x // i)` adds the value of `x // i` to the list `l`.
- The value of `x // i` is computed and appended to `l`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
