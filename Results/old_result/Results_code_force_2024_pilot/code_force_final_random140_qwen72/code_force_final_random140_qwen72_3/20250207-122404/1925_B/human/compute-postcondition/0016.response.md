The code snippet `l = [ans]` updates the list `l` to contain only the value of `ans`. Given that `ans` is 1, the list `l` is now `[1]`.

Let's summarize the impact on the program:

- `l` is updated to `[1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `l` is [1].**
