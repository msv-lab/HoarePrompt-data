Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1 if `x % 2` is not 0 or `x // 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is `max(1, x // 2)`, `i` is 3. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is `[ans, 3]`. Otherwise, `l` remains `[ans]`.***
