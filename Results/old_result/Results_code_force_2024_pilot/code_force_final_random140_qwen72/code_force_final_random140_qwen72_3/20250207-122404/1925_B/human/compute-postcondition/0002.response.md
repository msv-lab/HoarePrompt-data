Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.** 

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of the integer division of `x` by `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. The integer division (`//`) ensures that `k` is an integer representing the quotient when `x` is divided by `n`.
