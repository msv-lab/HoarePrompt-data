Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than `int(x)`, `l` contains `[1, 2, x // 2]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` contains `[1, x // 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the result of `x // i` to the list `l`.
- Given `i` is 2, the value `x // 2` is appended to `l`.
- If `i` (which is 2) is less than or equal to `k`, `l` initially contains `[1, 2]`, so after appending `x // 2`, `l` becomes `[1, 2, x // 2]`.
- If `i` (which is 2) is greater than `k`, `l` initially contains `[1]`, so after appending `x // 2`, `l` becomes `[1, x // 2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
