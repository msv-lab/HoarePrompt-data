Correctness: **True**

The program provided appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. It iterates over the divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`, checking if they can be used as the difficulty of the sub-problems while ensuring that the total number of sub-problems does not exceed `n`. The maximum divisor that meets these criteria is selected as the answer, which corresponds to the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the sub-problems' difficulties. This approach ensures that the solution is optimal for maximizing the balance of the problem set.
