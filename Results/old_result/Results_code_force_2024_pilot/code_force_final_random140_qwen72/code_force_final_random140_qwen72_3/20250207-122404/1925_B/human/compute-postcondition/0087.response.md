Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than `int(x)`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains `[1, 2, x // 2]`. Otherwise, `l` contains `[1, x // 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = max(l)` assigns the maximum value from the list `l` to the variable `ans`.
- The list `l` contains different elements based on the condition: if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains `[1, 2, x // 2]`. Otherwise, `l` contains `[1, x // 2]`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum value in `l`.
- All other variables (`_`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged, and their conditions still hold true.
