Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[1]`.** 

The list `l` now contains the value `1`, which was the initial value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
