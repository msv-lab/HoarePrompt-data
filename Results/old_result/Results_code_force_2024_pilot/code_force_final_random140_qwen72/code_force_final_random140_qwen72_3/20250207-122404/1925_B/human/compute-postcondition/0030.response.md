Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 3, and `l` is a list. If `x % 2` is 0, `l` is [1, 1, `x // 2`] if `x // 2` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `l` remains [1, 1]. If `x % 2` is 0, `ans` is updated to `max(1, x // 2)` if `x // 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` remains 1. If `x % 2` is not 0, `l` remains [1, 1] and `ans` remains 1. If `x % 3` is 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and if `x // 3` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is updated to `[ans, 3, x // 3]`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `[ans, x // 3]`. If `x % 3` is not 0, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged from their values determined by the `x % 2` condition.***
