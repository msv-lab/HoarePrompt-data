Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is set to 1, and the current value of `i` divides `x` without leaving a remainder. `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans`.***
