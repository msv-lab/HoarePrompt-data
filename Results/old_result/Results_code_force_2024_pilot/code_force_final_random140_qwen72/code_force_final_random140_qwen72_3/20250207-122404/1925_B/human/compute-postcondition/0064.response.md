Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, and `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `x` remains unchanged, and `k` remains the integer division of `x` by `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will have incremented to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` (inclusive).
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. This is because the loop checks each `i` from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` to see if it is a divisor of `x`. If `i` is a divisor and `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of these values.
- **`x` and `k`**: These variables remain unchanged throughout the loop. `x` is the original input value, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
