Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

- `_` is not explicitly tracked, so we don't need to consider it.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, i.e., `k = x // n`.
- `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `i` is the last value it reached, which is `int(x)`, but this is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(ans)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

To determine the value of `ans`, we need to understand that `k` is the largest integer such that `k * n <= x`. The value of `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `ans`, which is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
