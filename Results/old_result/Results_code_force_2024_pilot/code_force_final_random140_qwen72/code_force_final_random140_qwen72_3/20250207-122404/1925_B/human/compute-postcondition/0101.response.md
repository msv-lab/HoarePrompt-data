Functionality: ** The function reads multiple pairs of integers (x, n) from the standard input, where each pair represents a test case. For each test case, it calculates the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to the integer division of x by n. It then prints this divisor for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. **
