### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires dividing a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.
   - To maximize the GCD, we should consider the largest divisors of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the largest divisor that can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems by ensuring `i <= k` where `k = x // n`.
   - It also checks if `x // i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems by ensuring `x // i <= k`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly identifies the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The use of `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` ensures that all potential divisors are considered, including those just above the square root of `x`.
   - The logic for updating `ans` with the maximum valid divisor is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or `x` is a prime number correctly.
   - For `n = 1`, the GCD is simply `x`.
   - For `x` being a prime number, the GCD is 1 if `n > 1`.

### Evaluation Based on Annotations:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
  - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
  - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).

- **Inside the Loop:**
  - `x` and `n` are read from input.
  - `k` is calculated as `x // n`.
  - `ans` is initialized to 1.
  - The program iterates over potential divisors `i` from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
  - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` divides `x` without a remainder.
  - If `i` is a valid divisor, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`.
  - It updates `ans` with the maximum valid divisor found.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop, `ans` contains the maximum valid divisor of `x` that can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
  - The program prints `ans` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It efficiently checks all potential divisors and updates the answer accordingly. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state and logic throughout its execution.

**Final: **True**
