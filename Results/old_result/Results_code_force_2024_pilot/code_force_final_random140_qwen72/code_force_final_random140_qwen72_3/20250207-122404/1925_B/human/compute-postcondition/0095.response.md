Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than `int(x)`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is `[1, 3, x // 3]`. Otherwise, `l` is `[1, x // 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is updated to the maximum value in the list `l`.
- The list `l` is determined based on the condition whether `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
- All other variables (`_`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`) retain their initial values and conditions.
