The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

The function returns a result based on the values of these parameters. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the given information. Assuming the function is designed to perform some calculation or logic based on these parameters, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a result based on the values of these parameters.**
