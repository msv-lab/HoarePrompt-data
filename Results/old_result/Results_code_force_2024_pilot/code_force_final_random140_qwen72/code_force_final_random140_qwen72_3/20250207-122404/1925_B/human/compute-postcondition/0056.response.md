The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, which defines the upper limit of the loop. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables and expressions change.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- The loop condition is `i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2)`, which means `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` for the loop to continue.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The upper limit `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` remains the same because it is determined by the value of `x`, which does not change between iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, and `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and possibly the value `2`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i > k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans` and `2`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans` and `2`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `i > k`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans`, and `ans` is the same as before.**
