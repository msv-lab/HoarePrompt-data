Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is set to 1, and the current value of `i` divides `x` without leaving a remainder. `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` and, since `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is appended to `l`. The current value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
