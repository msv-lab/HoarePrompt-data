Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is the last value it reached, which is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it controls the number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.
- **`x` and `n`**: These variables are read from the input for each iteration of the outer loop and are used to compute `k` and `ans`.
- **`k`**: This is the integer division of `x` by `n`, calculated once per iteration of the outer loop.
- **`ans`**: This variable holds the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. It is updated during the inner loop.
- **`i`**: This variable is the loop counter in the inner loop, which iterates from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. After the inner loop completes, `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

The final state of `ans` after all iterations of the loop will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` for each test case. The value of `i` will be the last value it reached in the inner loop, which is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
