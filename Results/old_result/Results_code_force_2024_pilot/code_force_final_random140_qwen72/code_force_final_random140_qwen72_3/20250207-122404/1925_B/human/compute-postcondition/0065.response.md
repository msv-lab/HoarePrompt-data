To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- The initial state mentions that after the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will be equal to `int(x)`.
- However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `ans`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the value of the variable `ans`.
- Since the initial state does not provide any explicit value or formula for `ans`, we cannot determine its exact value based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of information about the variable `ans`, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable ans, which is not specified in the initial state)**
