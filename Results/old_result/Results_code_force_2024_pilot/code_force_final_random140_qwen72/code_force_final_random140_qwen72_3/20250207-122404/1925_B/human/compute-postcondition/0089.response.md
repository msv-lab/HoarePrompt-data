The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes and ensure that `i` is still within the bounds defined by the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- `i` must still be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains `[1, 2, x // 2]`. Otherwise, `l` contains `[1, x // 2]`.**
