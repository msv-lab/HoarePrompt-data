The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `_` is not explicitly tracked.
- `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`.
- `ans` is 1.
- `i` is 1.

For the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`**.
