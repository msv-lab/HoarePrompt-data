The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `h` is the number of characters in `a` that are not 'A' plus 1 if `j` is not 'A', or simply the number of characters in `a` that are not 'A' if `j` is 'A', the new value of `h` will be the initial value of `h` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `j` is the second character of `a`, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in `a' plus 1 if `j` is 'A' or remains the number of 'A' characters in `a' if `j` is not 'A', `h` is the number of characters in `a' that are not 'A' plus 1 if `j` is not 'A' or the number of characters in `a' that are not 'A' plus 2 if `j` is 'A'.**
