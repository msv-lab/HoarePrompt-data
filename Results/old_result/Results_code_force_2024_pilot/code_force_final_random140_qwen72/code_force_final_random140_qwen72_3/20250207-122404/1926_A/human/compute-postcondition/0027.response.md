Based on the initial state:

- `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
- `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`.
- `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`.
- The current value of `countA` is greater than the current value of `countB`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('A')
```

This statement simply prints the character 'A', regardless of the values of `userString`, `countA`, or `countB`.

Output: **A**
