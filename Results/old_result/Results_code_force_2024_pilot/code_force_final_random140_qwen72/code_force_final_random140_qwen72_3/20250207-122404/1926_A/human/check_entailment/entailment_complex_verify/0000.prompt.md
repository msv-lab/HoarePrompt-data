You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)

def func_1(userString):
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
    if countA > countB:
        print('A')
    elif countB > countA:
        print('B')
    else:
        pass



- Annotated Code: 
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func_1(userString):
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `userString` remains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The variable `countA` will be the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and the variable `countB` will be the total number of 'B's in `userString`.
    if (countA > countB) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        if (countB > countA) :
            print('B')
            #This is printed: B
        else :
            pass
        #State: *`userString` remains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The variable `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and the variable `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`. Additionally, `countA` is less than or equal to `countB`. If `countB` is greater than `countA`, no changes occur. If `countB` is equal to `countA`, no changes occur.
    #State: *`userString` remains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The variable `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and the variable `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`. If `countA` is greater than `countB`, no changes occur. If `countA` is less than or equal to `countB`, no changes occur.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `userString` of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. If there are more 'A's than 'B's, it prints 'A'. If there are more 'B's than 'A's, it prints 'B'. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it does nothing. The function does not modify `userString` and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly as specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the first line of input should contain an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing a string of length 5. However, the provided program incorrectly includes the number `8` as part of the list of strings, which should not be processed as a test case. Additionally, the program does not read input from the standard input but uses a predefined list, which does not match the problem's input specification. Furthermore, the function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which would result in a runtime error. Lastly, the program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, which, although not explicitly required by the problem statement, could be considered a logical oversight.
