Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly as specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the first line of input should contain an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing a string of length 5. However, the provided program incorrectly includes the number `8` as part of the list of strings, which should not be processed as a test case. Additionally, the program does not read input from the standard input but uses a predefined list, which does not match the problem's input specification. Furthermore, the function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which would result in a runtime error. Lastly, the program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, which, although not explicitly required by the problem statement, could be considered a logical oversight.
