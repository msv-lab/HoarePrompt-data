The only object in the loop head is the variable `letter`, which is derived from `userString`. For the loop to execute, `userString` must be a non-empty string. Given that `userString` is already defined as a string of length 5, the loop will execute without needing to adjust `userString` itself. However, for the loop to start, `letter` should take the value of the first character in `userString`.

State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `countA` is 0, `countB` is 0, `letter` is the first character in `userString`**
