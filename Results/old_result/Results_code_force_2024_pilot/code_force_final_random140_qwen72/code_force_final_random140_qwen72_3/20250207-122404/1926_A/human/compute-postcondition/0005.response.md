Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `countA` is 1, `countB` is 0, `letter` is 'A'.** 

Explanation: The code increments the value of `countA` by 1. Initially, `countA` was 0, so after the increment, `countA` becomes 1. The other variables (`userString`, `countB`, and `letter`) remain unchanged.
