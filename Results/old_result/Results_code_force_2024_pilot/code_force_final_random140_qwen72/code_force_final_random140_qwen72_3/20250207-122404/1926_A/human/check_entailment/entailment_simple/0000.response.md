Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts with a list of strings `userStrings` which includes the number of test cases as its first element. This is not ideal because the actual test cases start from the second element. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program since the loop iterates over all elements in `userStrings`, including the first one, which is not a valid test case. In a real scenario, the first element should be removed or ignored.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single string `userString` as input. It correctly initializes counters `countA` and `countB` to zero.

3. **Counting Letters**: The function iterates over each character in `userString` and increments the appropriate counter (`countA` for 'A' and `countB` for 'B'). This part of the code is correct.

4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the letters, the function compares `countA` and `countB`:
   - If `countA` is greater than `countB`, it prints 'A'.
   - If `countB` is greater than `countA`, it prints 'B'.
   - If `countA` is equal to `countB`, it does nothing (which is correct according to the problem statement, as there is no specified behavior for ties).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all possible inputs correctly, including cases where the counts are equal (though no output is expected in such cases).

6. **Overall Flow**: The program processes each string in `userStrings` and prints the correct output for each test case, except for the first element '8', which is not a valid test case but does not affect the correctness of the other test cases.

Given the above points, the program is logically correct for the problem described, despite the minor issue with the first element in `userStrings`.

Correctness: **True**
