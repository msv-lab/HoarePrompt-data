Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts with a list of strings, including the number of test cases ('8') and the actual test cases. However, the program should ideally read the number of test cases separately and then iterate over the test cases. This discrepancy is not affecting the correctness of the function itself but is a point to note for the overall structure of the program.

2. **Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly converts the input string into a list of characters, although this conversion (`list(userString)`) is unnecessary since the string can be iterated directly.
   - It initializes counters for 'A' and 'B' and iterates through each character in the string, updating the respective counters.
   - After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the character that appears more frequently. If the counts are equal, it does nothing, which is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal by doing nothing, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - The function correctly handles strings of length 5 with only 'A' and 'B'.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct output for each test case as per the example provided.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` is logically correct and produces the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
