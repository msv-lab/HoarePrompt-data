The code `list(userString)` converts the string `userString` into a list of its characters. Since `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', the resulting list will contain these characters in the same order.

Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and the result of `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each being either 'A' or 'B', in the same order as they appear in `userString`.**
