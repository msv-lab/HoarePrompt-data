The value of `countB` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if the second character is 'B', then `countA` is 0 and `countB` is 1, and if the second character is 'A', then `countA` is 1 and `countB` is 0, the only valid scenario here is that the second character is 'B', making `countB` initially 1. After incrementing, `countB` becomes 2. The value of `countA` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the second character in `userString`, `countA` is 0, `countB` is 2.**
