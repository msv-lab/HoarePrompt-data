Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating whether the arrows in the two strings can form a valid grid configuration.**
