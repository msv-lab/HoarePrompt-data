### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell `(1, 1)` and must reach cell `(2, n)`.
   - The robot makes two moves per second: one move in a direction (left, right, up, or down), followed by a move in the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
   - The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must always stay within the grid.
   - The robot's movement is constrained by the arrows in the cells.
   - The robot can only move to the next column or the same column but in the other row.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows.
   - It then checks for each odd-indexed column (starting from index 1) if the robot can get stuck in a loop or if it can move to the next column.

4. **Specific Checks:**
   - The program checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop by examining the arrows in the current and adjacent columns.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot can move from the current column to the next column without getting stuck.
   - If the robot can get stuck (i.e., if the arrows form a loop that prevents the robot from moving forward), it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the robot can move through all columns without getting stuck, it prints "YES".

5. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary states that the function checks for adjacent arrows pointing towards each other, which would cause the robot to get stuck.
   - However, the actual implementation in the code checks for specific conditions involving the arrows in the current and adjacent columns:
     - `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.
   - These conditions ensure that the robot cannot move forward if it encounters a configuration where it would get stuck.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the robot can move directly to the target cell `(2, n)` without getting stuck.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the robot gets stuck in a loop and cannot reach the target cell.

7. **Correctness of the Implementation:**
   - The conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are sufficient to ensure that the robot does not get stuck in a loop.
   - The program correctly prints "NO" if the robot gets stuck and "YES" if it can reach the target cell.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` based on the given constraints and problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
