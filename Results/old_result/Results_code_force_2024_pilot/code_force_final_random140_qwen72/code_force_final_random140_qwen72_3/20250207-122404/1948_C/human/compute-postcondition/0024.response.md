Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4.
- `j` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `i` is set to 1.
- The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true.

Given this condition, the `print` statement will always execute and print 'NO'. This is because the condition being true means that the specific pattern in the strings `a` and `b` is met, leading to the execution of the `print` statement.

Output: **NO**
