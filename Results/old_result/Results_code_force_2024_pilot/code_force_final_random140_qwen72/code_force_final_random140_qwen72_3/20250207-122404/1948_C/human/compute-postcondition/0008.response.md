Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1. If (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.***
