The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the arrows in the two strings can form a valid grid configuration by ensuring no two adjacent arrows point towards each other. If any such pair is found, the function outputs 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function does not return any values but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
