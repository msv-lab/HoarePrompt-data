Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, so the final output is 'YES' for each test case that did not encounter the break condition.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains unchanged as it was initially set.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`.
- **`n`**: For each test case, `n` is an input integer representing the number of columns in the grid.
- **`a` and `b`**: These are the input strings for the current test case, which are read in each iteration of the outer loop.
- **`i`**: This is the loop variable for the inner loop, which iterates over the odd indices of the strings `a` and `b`. After the inner loop completes, `i` will be the largest odd integer less than `n`.
- **Output**: The final output for each test case will be 'YES' if the loop did not break due to the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`. If the condition was met at any point, the output for that test case would be 'NO'.
