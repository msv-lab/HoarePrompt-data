You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Each test case includes two strings of length n, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, so the final output is 'YES' for each test case that did not encounter the break condition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the arrows in the two strings can form a valid grid configuration by ensuring no two adjacent arrows point towards each other. If any such pair is found, the function outputs 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function does not return any values but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a 2xN grid where each cell has an arrow pointing either left (`<`) or right (`>`).
   - The robot starts at cell `(1, 1)` and must reach cell `(2, n)`.
   - The robot makes two moves per second: one move in a direction (left, right, up, or down), followed by a move in the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
   - The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must always stay within the grid.
   - The robot's movement is constrained by the arrows in the cells.
   - The robot can only move to the next column or the same column but in the other row.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows.
   - It then checks for each odd-indexed column (starting from index 1) if the robot can get stuck in a loop or if it can move to the next column.

4. **Specific Checks:**
   - The program checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop by examining the arrows in the current and adjacent columns.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot can move from the current column to the next column without getting stuck.
   - If the robot can get stuck (i.e., if the arrows form a loop that prevents the robot from moving forward), it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the robot can move through all columns without getting stuck, it prints "YES".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the robot can move directly to the target cell `(2, n)` without getting stuck.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the robot gets stuck in a loop and cannot reach the target cell.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` based on the given constraints and problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
