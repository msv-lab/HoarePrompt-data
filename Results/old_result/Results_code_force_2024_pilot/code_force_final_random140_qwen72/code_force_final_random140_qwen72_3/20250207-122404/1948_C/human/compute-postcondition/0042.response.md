Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4.
2. `j` is 0.
3. `n` is a new input integer greater than 1.
4. `b` is a new input string.
5. `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`.
6. `a` is a new input string.
7. Either:
   - (i + 1 < n and the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is '<')
   - (the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` is '<')

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement directly. They only describe the state of the variables and strings involved, but they do not change the fact that the `print` statement will always print `'NO'`.

### Explanation:
- The conditions ensure that certain characters are present at specific indices in the strings `a` and `b`, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is a simple command to output the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
