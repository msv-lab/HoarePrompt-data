Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `j` is 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is 1.
- The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true.

Given this condition, the code snippet `print('NO')` will always execute and print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
