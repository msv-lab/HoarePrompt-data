The code snippet `ans.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements
- `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`
- If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, then `ans` also contains the first element of `arr` minus 1. Otherwise, `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and `x`
- `x` is the second element in `arr[1:]`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `x` (which is the second element in `arr[1:]`) is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements, `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and `x`, where `x` is the second element in `arr[1:]`.**
