The code snippet `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is the last element of `ans` minus 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements
- `x` is the third element in `arr[1:]`
- `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and either the last element of `ans` minus 1 or `x` depending on the condition

After executing the code snippet:
- The last element of `ans` is now `ans[-1] - 1`.
- The length of `ans` is increased by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements
- `x` is the third element in `arr[1:]`
- `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and either the last element of `ans` minus 1 or `x` depending on the condition, followed by the last element of `ans` minus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `arr[1:]`, and `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and either the last element of `ans` minus 1 or `x` depending on the condition, followed by the last element of `ans` minus 1.**
