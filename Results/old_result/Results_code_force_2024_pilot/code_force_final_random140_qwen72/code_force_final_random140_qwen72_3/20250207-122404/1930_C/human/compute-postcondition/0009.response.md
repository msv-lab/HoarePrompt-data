Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `st` is a set containing the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5.
- The list `arr` remains a list of `n` integers, each within the range 1 to 10^9.
- The set `st` now contains the values calculated as `arr[i] + i + 1` for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The loop index `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
