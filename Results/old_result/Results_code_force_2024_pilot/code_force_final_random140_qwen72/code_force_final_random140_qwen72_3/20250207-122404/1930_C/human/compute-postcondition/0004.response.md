Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `st` is a set containing the value `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code adds the value `arr[0] + 1` to the set `st`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of the list `arr` (which is `arr[0]`) is used in the calculation. The set `st` now contains one element, which is `arr[0] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
