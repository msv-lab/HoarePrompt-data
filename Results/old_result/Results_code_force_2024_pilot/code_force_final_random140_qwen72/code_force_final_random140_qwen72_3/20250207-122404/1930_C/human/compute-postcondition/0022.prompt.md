You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(sum, enumerate(map(int, input().split()), start=1)))
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    ans = [arr[0]]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        if x >= ans[-1]:
            ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        else:
            ans.append(x)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is a list where each element is either the first element of `arr` minus the index (starting from 0) or the corresponding element from `arr` if it is less than the previous element in `ans`. The length of `ans` is equal to the length of `arr`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 10 9 8 7 6 (where the elements are the values of the ans list constructed as described)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It handles up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`. The function's specific output or return value is not provided, but it is expected to perform some operation on the array `a` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
