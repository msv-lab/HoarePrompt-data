Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by iterating through the array `a`, adding the value `a[i] + i + 1` to a set `st`, and then printing the sorted elements of `st` in descending order. This approach is correct because:

1. **Set Usage**: The use of a set ensures that only unique values are stored, which aligns with the problem's requirement that the set `S` cannot contain duplicate elements.

2. **Index Calculation**: The expression `arr[i] + i + 1` correctly calculates the value to be added to the set, as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Sorting and Output**: Sorting the set in descending order and printing the elements ensures that the output is the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

4. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the array `a` has only one element or when all elements are the same, as the set will still correctly store the unique values and sort them.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
