To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind the construction of the `ans` list:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `ans` is a list where each element is either:
  - The first element of `arr` minus the index (starting from 0), or
  - The corresponding element from `arr` if it is less than the previous element in `ans`.

### Construction of `ans`:
1. Initialize `ans` with the same length as `arr`.
2. For each index `i` in `arr`:
   - If `i == 0`, set `ans[i]` to `arr[0]`.
   - Otherwise, set `ans[i]` to `max(arr[0] - i, arr[i])`.

### Explanation:
- The first element of `ans` will always be `arr[0]` because `i == 0`.
- For subsequent elements, `ans[i]` will be the maximum of `arr[0] - i` and `arr[i]`.
- Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[i]` will be less than or equal to `arr[0] - i` for large enough `i`.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `arr = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.
- `ans` will be constructed as follows:
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] = 10`
  - `ans[1] = max(10 - 1, 8) = max(9, 8) = 9`
  - `ans[2] = max(10 - 2, 6) = max(8, 6) = 8`
  - `ans[3] = max(10 - 3, 4) = max(7, 4) = 7`
  - `ans[4] = max(10 - 4, 2) = max(6, 2) = 6`

So, `ans` will be `[10, 9, 8, 7, 6]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **10 9 8 7 6 (where the elements are the values of the ans list constructed as described)**

This output will vary depending on the specific values in `arr`, but the pattern will follow the rules described.
