Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
