You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `st` is a set containing the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.
    print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))
    #This is printed: [sorted elements of st in descending order]



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It initializes an empty set `st`.
4. It iterates over the array, and for each element at index `i`, it calculates `arr[i] + i + 1` and adds this value to the set `st`.
5. After processing all elements, it sorts the set in descending order and prints the elements.

The key points to verify:
- The program correctly processes each test case independently.
- The calculation `arr[i] + i + 1` is done correctly for each element.
- The set `st` ensures that only unique values are stored.
- The final output is sorted in descending order, which is required to get the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Given the problem statement and the requirements, the program appears to follow the correct logic and steps to achieve the desired output. Therefore, the program is correct.
