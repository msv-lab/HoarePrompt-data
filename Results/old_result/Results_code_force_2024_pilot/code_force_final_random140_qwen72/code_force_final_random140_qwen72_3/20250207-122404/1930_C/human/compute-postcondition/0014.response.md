Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements. If `x` (the second element in `arr[1:]`) is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, then `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and the last element of `ans` minus 1. Otherwise, `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and `x`.***
