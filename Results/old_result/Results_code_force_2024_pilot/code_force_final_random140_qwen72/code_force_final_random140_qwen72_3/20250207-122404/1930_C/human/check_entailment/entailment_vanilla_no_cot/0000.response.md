Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty set `st` to store the unique values of `a_i + i + 1`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr`, adding each value `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of the set `st` sorted in descending order.

3. **Set Operations**:
   - Using a set ensures that only unique values are stored, which aligns with the problem's requirement that `S` is a set and not a multiset.
   - The expression `arr[i] + i + 1` correctly calculates the value to be added to the set, as per the problem description.

4. **Output**:
   - The program sorts the set in descending order and prints the elements, which matches the requirement to output the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Given these points, the program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
