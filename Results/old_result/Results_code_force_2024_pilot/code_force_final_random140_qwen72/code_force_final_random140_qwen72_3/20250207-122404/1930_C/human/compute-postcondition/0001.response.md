The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and the constraints on `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
