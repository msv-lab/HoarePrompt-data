The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. The function should handle up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`, and the array `a` consists of `n` integers, each in the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but typically, such functions would return or print results for each test case based on some computation involving the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It handles up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`. The function's specific output or return value is not provided, but it is expected to perform some operation on the array `a` for each test case.**
