Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It then computes a set of values where each value is the sum of an element from the list and its index plus one. Finally, it prints the elements of this set in descending order. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a new input of `n` and a corresponding list of integers. After processing each test case, the function outputs the sorted set of computed values. **
