Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, where each element was originally the sum of the index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for x in arr[1:]:
    if x >= ans[-1]:
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    else:
        ans.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, then `ans` also contains the first element of `arr` minus 1. Otherwise, `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements. If `x` (the second element in `arr[1:]`) is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, then `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and the last element of `ans` minus 1. Otherwise, `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `arr[1:]`, and `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and either the last element of `ans` minus 1 or `x` depending on the condition. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, `ans` is updated to contain the first element of `arr`, the last element of `ans` minus 1, and the last element of `ans` minus 1 again. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to contain the first element of `arr`, the last element of `ans` minus 1, and `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
