Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It initializes an empty set `st`.
4. It iterates over the array, and for each element at index `i`, it calculates `arr[i] + i + 1` and adds this value to the set `st`.
5. After processing all elements, it sorts the set in descending order and prints the elements.

The key points to verify:
- The program correctly processes each test case independently.
- The calculation `arr[i] + i + 1` is done correctly for each element.
- The set `st` ensures that only unique values are stored.
- The final output is sorted in descending order, which is required to get the lexicographically largest array `b`.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program's approach:
- The problem specifies that the array `a` is modified by removing the selected element after each operation, and the indices of all elements to the right of the removed element decrease by 1. This means that the indices used in the calculation `arr[i] + i + 1` should reflect the current state of the array after each removal.
- The current implementation does not account for the dynamic changes in the array `a` and simply uses the original indices. This could lead to incorrect results if the same index is used for different elements in subsequent iterations.

To illustrate, consider the example:
```
Input:
1
3
6 4 8
```
The correct sequence of operations should be:
1. Select `i = 0` (element 6), insert `6 + 0 + 1 = 7` into `S`, remove `6` from `a`. Array `a` becomes `[4, 8]`.
2. Select `i = 0` (element 4), insert `4 + 0 + 1 = 5` into `S`, remove `4` from `a`. Array `a` becomes `[8]`.
3. Select `i = 0` (element 8), insert `8 + 0 + 1 = 9` into `S`, remove `8` from `a`. Array `a` becomes `[]`.

The set `S` will be `{7, 5, 9}`, and the sorted output will be `[9, 7, 5]`.

However, the current program will calculate:
1. `6 + 0 + 1 = 7`
2. `4 + 1 + 1 = 6`
3. `8 + 2 + 1 = 11`

The set `S` will be `{7, 6, 11}`, and the sorted output will be `[11, 7, 6]`.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly handle the dynamic changes in the array `a`.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly implement the specified operations.

Final: **False**
