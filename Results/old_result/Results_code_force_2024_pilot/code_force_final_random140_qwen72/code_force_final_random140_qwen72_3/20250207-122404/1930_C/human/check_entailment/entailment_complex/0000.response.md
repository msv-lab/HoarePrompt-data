Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The outer loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` correctly handles multiple test cases. Each test case starts by reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`.

2. **Set Operations**: Inside the `func_1` function, a set `st` is initialized. The loop `for i in range(n):` iterates over the array `arr`, and for each element `arr[i]`, it adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. This matches the problem's requirement to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S` and then remove `a_i` from the array `a`.

3. **Set Properties**: Since sets automatically handle duplicates, inserting `arr[i] + i + 1` ensures that only unique values are stored in `st`, which aligns with the problem's constraint that `S` is a set and not a multiset.

4. **Sorting and Output**: After populating the set `st`, the program sorts the elements in descending order using `sorted(st, reverse=True)` and prints them. This correctly constructs the array `b` as required, which is the set `S` sorted in decreasing order.

5. **Test Case Handling**: The program processes each test case independently, ensuring that the state is reset for each new test case.

Given that the program adheres to the problem's requirements and produces the correct output for each test case, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
