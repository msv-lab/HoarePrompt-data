To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and \(10^9\).
4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).
5. `st` is a set containing the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
6. `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Set Construction (`st`):**
   - The set `st` is constructed by iterating over the list `arr` and adding the value `arr[i] + i + 1` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - This means `st` contains unique values of the form `arr[i] + i + 1`.

2. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The `sorted` function is used to sort the elements of the set `st` in descending order (since `reverse=True`).
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the sorted list, so each element is printed separated by spaces.

### Output Determination:
- The output will be the elements of the set `st` sorted in descending order.
- Each element in `st` is of the form `arr[i] + i + 1` for some index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[sorted elements of st in descending order]** (where each element is of the form `arr[i] + i + 1` for some index `i` from 0 to `n-1`)

This output will be a sequence of numbers, each representing a unique value of `arr[i] + i + 1` for some index `i`, sorted in descending order.
