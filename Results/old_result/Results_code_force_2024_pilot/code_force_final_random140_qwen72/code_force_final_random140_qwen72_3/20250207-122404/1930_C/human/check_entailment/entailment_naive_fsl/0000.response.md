Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required algorithm according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the dynamic changes in the array `a` after each operation, which is a critical part of the problem. The problem requires that after each insertion, the element `a_i` is removed from the array `a`, and the indices of the remaining elements to the right of `a_i` are adjusted. However, the program simply iterates over the original array and adds `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set without removing any elements or adjusting indices.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
6 4 8
```
According to the problem description, the optimal way to maximize the lexicographical order of the resulting array `b` is to always choose the last element of the array `a` in each step. This would result in the following operations:

1. Choose `i = 3` (last element), insert `8 + 3 = 11` into `S`, and remove `8` from `a`. Now `a = [6, 4]`.
2. Choose `i = 2` (last element), insert `4 + 2 = 6` into `S`, and remove `4` from `a`. Now `a = [6]`.
3. Choose `i = 1` (last element), insert `6 + 1 = 7` into `S`, and remove `6` from `a`. Now `a` is empty.

The set `S` will be `{11, 7, 6}`, and sorting it in descending order gives `b = [11, 7, 6]`.

However, the provided program will produce:
```
11 7 6
```
which is correct in this case, but it fails to handle the dynamic changes in the array `a` correctly. For example, if the input is:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
4 3 2
```
But the program will produce:
```
4 3 2
```
This is coincidentally correct, but the program's logic is flawed because it does not follow the problem's requirement to remove elements and adjust indices dynamically. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
