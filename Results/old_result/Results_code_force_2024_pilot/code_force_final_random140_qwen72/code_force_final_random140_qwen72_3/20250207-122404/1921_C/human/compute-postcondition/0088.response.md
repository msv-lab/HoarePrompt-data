Output State: **`possible` is `False`, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second integer input by the user reduced by `energy_cost`, `a` is the third integer input by the user, `b` is the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is 2, `f` is now reduced by `energy_cost`, which is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]` and also `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, and `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`**.
