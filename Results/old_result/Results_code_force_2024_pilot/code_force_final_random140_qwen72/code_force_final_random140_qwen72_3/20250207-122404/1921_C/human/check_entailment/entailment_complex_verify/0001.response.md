### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `possible` is initialized to `True`, indicating that it is initially assumed that all messages can be sent.

3. **Loop Through Messages**:
   - The function iterates through each message time from `1` to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Calculate Time Difference**:
   - For each message, it calculates the time difference `time_diff` between the current message time `arr[i]` and the previous message time `arr[i-1]`.

5. **Calculate Energy Costs**:
   - `energy_keep_on`: The energy cost if the phone remains on for the entire duration `time_diff`.
   - `energy_turn_off_on`: The energy cost if the phone is turned off and then turned back on.

6. **Determine Minimum Energy Cost**:
   - The function determines the minimum energy cost between keeping the phone on and turning it off and on.

7. **Check Energy Sufficiency**:
   - If the remaining charge `f` is less than or equal to the minimum energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

8. **Update Remaining Charge**:
   - If the remaining charge is sufficient, it subtracts the minimum energy cost from `f`.

9. **Output Result**:
   - After processing all messages, it prints "YES" if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial State**:
  - The function correctly initializes the number of test cases and reads the necessary inputs for each test case.

- **Time Difference Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `time_diff` is correct: `time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`.

- **Energy Cost Calculation**:
  - The energy cost for keeping the phone on is calculated as `energy_keep_on = a * time_diff`.
  - The energy cost for turning the phone off and on is `energy_turn_off_on = b`.
  - The minimum energy cost is correctly determined using `min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`.

- **Energy Sufficiency Check**:
  - The function correctly checks if the remaining charge `f` is sufficient to cover the minimum energy cost.
  - If `f <= energy_cost`, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop, which is the correct behavior.

- **Update Remaining Charge**:
  - The function correctly updates the remaining charge by subtracting the minimum energy cost: `f -= energy_cost`.

- **Output**:
  - The function prints "YES" if `possible` is `True` and "NO" otherwise, which is the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning. The logic and calculations are accurate, and the function handles multiple test cases as required.

Final: **True**
