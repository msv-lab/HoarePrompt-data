Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Additionally, there is a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    possible = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
        energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
        energy_turn_off_on = b
        energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
        if f <= energy_cost:
            possible = False
            break
        f -= energy_cost
    print('YES' if possible else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `i` is `n + 1`, `f` is reduced by the sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration, where `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `arr` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` retains its original value, `i` is `n + 1`, `f` is reduced by the total of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is incremented by `n`, `time_diff` is the last computed difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last computed energy cost for keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last computed minimum energy cost, and `possible` is `False` if at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `f` is greater than `energy_cost` or not throughout the loop. If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. The variable `f` is reduced by the cumulative sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration, where `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `i` is `n + 1` after the loop completes. The variables `arr`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` retain their original values. The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` hold the values computed in the last iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
