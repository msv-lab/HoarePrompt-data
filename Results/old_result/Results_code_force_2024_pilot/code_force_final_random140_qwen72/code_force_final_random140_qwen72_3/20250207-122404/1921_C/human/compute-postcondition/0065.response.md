Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is incremented by 1, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`.***
