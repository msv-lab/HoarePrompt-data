Output State: **`n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input, `i` is `n + 1`, `f` is reduced by the sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `possible` is `True` if `f` remains greater than `energy_cost` throughout the iterations, otherwise `possible` is `False`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**
