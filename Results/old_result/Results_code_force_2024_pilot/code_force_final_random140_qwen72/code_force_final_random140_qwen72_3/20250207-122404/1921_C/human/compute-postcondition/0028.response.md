Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `f` is reduced by `energy_cost`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `energy_cost` is updated to the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, and `energy_turn_off_on` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `possible` and the reduction of `f` by `energy_cost` remain as described in the initial state.
