Output State: **`possible` is `False`, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 3, `f` is the second integer input by the user reduced by `energy_cost` twice, `a` is the third integer input by the user, `b` is the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
