You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Additionally, there is a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether the phone's charge `f` is sufficient to handle all the message sending operations. If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to the energy cost required to either keep the phone on or turn it off and on, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. The variable `f` is reduced by the cumulative sum of the minimum energy costs (`energy_cost`) for each iteration, where `energy_cost` is the smaller of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `i` is `n + 1` after the loop completes. The variables `arr`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` retain their original values. The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` hold the values computed in the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of messages `n`, initial phone charge `f`, charge consumption per unit of time `a`, charge consumption when turning the phone off and on `b`, and a list of moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` when messages need to be sent. It returns whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
