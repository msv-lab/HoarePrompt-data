Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is `n + 1`, `f` is reduced by the sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration, where `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the index `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has run through all valid indices from 1 to `n`. The variable `f` will have been reduced by the total energy cost calculated during each iteration. This energy cost is determined as the minimum value between the energy required to keep the system on (`a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`) and the energy required to turn the system off and back on (`b`). If at any point during the iterations, `f` becomes less than or equal to the energy cost, the variable `possible` is set to `False`, and the loop terminates early. If the loop completes without `f` becoming less than or equal to the energy cost, `possible` remains `True`. The values of `a`, `b`, and the list `arr` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
