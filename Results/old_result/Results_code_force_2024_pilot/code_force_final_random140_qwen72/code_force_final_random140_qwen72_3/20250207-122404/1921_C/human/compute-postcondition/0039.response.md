To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, and `i` starts from 1.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user.
- `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `f` is reduced by the sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration.
- `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `possible` is `True`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute, `i` should start from 1, and `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1**
