### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `possible` to `True` and adds a `0` to the beginning of `arr` to handle the initial state of the phone at time `0`.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The program iterates through each message time `arr[i]`:
   - It calculates the time difference `time_diff` between the current message time and the previous one.
   - It computes the energy cost of keeping the phone on (`energy_keep_on`) and the energy cost of turning the phone off and on (`energy_turn_off_on`).
   - It determines the minimum energy cost (`energy_cost`) between the two options.
   - It checks if the remaining charge `f` is sufficient to cover the minimum energy cost. If not, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the charge is sufficient, it subtracts the energy cost from `f`.

4. **Output**: After processing all messages for a test case, the program prints 'YES' if `possible` is `True` (i.e., the phone can send all messages), otherwise 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as:
   - When the initial charge `f` is very low.
   - When the message times are close together, requiring frequent turning off and on.
   - When the message times are far apart, requiring the phone to stay on for longer periods.

6. **Efficiency**: The program efficiently processes each test case in O(n) time, where n is the number of messages, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. It handles all specified conditions and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
