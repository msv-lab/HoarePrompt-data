### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes a variable `possible` to `True`, which will be used to determine if it is possible to send all messages.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The function iterates through each message time from `1` to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Calculate Time Difference**: For each message, it calculates the time difference `time_diff` between the current message time `arr[i]` and the previous message time `arr[i-1]`.

5. **Calculate Energy Costs**:
   - `energy_keep_on`: The energy cost if the phone remains on for the entire duration `time_diff`.
   - `energy_turn_off_on`: The energy cost if the phone is turned off and then turned back on.

6. **Determine Minimum Energy Cost**: The function determines the minimum energy cost between keeping the phone on and turning it off and on.

7. **Check Energy Sufficiency**: If the remaining charge `f` is less than or equal to the minimum energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

8. **Update Remaining Charge**: If the remaining charge is sufficient, it subtracts the minimum energy cost from `f`.

9. **Output Result**: After processing all messages, it prints "YES" if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the decision between keeping the phone on and turning it off and on.
- The energy calculations are accurate and consider both scenarios.
- The function correctly updates the remaining charge and checks if it is sufficient to send the next message.
- The function handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.

Correctness: **True**
