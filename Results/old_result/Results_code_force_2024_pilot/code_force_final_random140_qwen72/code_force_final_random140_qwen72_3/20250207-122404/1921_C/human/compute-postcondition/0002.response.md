The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. Since the input is split and converted to integers, each of these variables will hold an integer value. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
