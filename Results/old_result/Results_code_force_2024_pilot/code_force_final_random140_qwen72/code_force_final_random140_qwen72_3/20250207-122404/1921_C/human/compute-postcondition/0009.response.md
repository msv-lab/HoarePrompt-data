Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `a`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * a`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * a, b)`**. 

The variable `energy_cost` is assigned the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` (which is `a * a`) and `energy_turn_off_on` (which is `b`). All other variables remain unchanged.
