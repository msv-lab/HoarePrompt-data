Output State: **`arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `f` is `f - min(a * arr[1], b)`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is incremented by 1, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * arr[1], b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`.**
