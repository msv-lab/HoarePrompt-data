Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `a`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * a`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.** 

The value of `energy_turn_off_on` is now set to the value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
