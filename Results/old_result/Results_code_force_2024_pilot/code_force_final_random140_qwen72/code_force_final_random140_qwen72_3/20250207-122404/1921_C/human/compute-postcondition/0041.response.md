Output State: **`arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * arr[1]`.** 

Explanation: The variable `energy_keep_on` is assigned the value of `a * time_diff`. Since `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]` and `arr[0]` is 0, `time_diff` simplifies to `arr[1]`. Therefore, `energy_keep_on` is `a * arr[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
