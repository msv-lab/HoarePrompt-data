Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `arr` is updated to a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is updated to the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `f` is updated to the second integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the third integer input by the user, `b` is updated to the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is 1, `f` is reduced by the total of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `possible` is `False` if at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `energy_cost` is assigned the value of the minimum between `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`.
- `energy_keep_on` is calculated as `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`.
- `energy_turn_off_on` is simply `b`.
- All other variables (`possible`, `arr`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `_`, `time_diff`) retain their values from the initial state.
- The condition for `possible` being `False` if `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost` remains unchanged.
