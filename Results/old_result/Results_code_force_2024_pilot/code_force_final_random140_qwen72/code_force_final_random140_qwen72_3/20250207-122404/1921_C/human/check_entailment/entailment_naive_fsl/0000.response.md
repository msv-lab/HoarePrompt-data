Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial charge `f` is exactly equal to the energy cost required to send the message. According to the problem description, if the charge level drops to 0 or below, it is impossible to send a message. However, the program incorrectly continues to subtract the energy cost from `f` even when `f` is exactly equal to the energy cost, leading to a situation where `f` becomes 0, and the program still considers it possible to send the message.

Example Case:
```
Input:
1
1 3 1 3
3

Expected Output:
NO

Actual Output:
YES
```

In this case, the initial charge `f` is 3, and the energy cost to keep the phone on until the message is sent at moment 3 is also 3. The program should output "NO" because the charge will drop to 0, making it impossible to send the message. However, the program outputs "YES," which is incorrect.
