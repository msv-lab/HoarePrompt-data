Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `time_diff` is `a`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * a`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * a, b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.***
