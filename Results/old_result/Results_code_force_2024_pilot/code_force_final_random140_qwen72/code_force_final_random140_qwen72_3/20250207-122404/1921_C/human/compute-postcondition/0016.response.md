The code snippet `time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` calculates the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in the array `arr`, and assigns this difference to the variable `time_diff`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`

After executing the code:
- `time_diff` is now equal to `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`.
- The value of `i` remains `i + 1`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i` is still valid.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`.**
