Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`.** 

Explanation: The variable `energy_keep_on` is assigned the value of `a * time_diff`, where `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `time_diff` remain unchanged, but `energy_keep_on` now holds the calculated value.
