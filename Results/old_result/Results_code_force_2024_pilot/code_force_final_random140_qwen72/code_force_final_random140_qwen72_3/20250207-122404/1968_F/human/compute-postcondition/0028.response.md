Based on the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `n` is the length of the list `a`, which contains integers.
- `x` is a list of `n + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `l` and `r` are indices returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is true, meaning the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`.
- `lower` is the second largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or -1 if no such index exists.
- `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
- `upper` is greater than `lower`.
- `l` is less than or equal to `upper`.
- `upper` is less than or equal to `r`.
- `l` is less than or equal to `lower`, which is less than or equal to `r`.

Given these conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute because all the conditions specified in the initial state are met. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
