Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `i` is 1.
- `q` must be greater than 1.
- `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
