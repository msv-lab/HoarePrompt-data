The code snippet updates the value of `lower` based on the result of `func_2` applied to `inds[x[r]]` with a condition that checks if the argument is less than `l`. If `func_2` returns a value, `lower` is set to that value; otherwise, `lower` is set to `-1`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `lower` is updated to the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or `-1`.
- The function `func_2` is expected to return the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `i` is 2.
- `q` is greater than 2.
- `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.
- `upper` is the value at the position `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.
- If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins. Otherwise, the conditions are not met, and the loop continues normally.

After executing the code snippet:
- `lower` is updated to the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.

Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 2, `q` is greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists, `upper` is the value at the position `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins. Otherwise, the conditions are not met, and the loop continues normally.**
