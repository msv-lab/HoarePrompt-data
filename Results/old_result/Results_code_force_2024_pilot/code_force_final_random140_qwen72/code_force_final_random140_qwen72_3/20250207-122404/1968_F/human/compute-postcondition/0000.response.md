The function `func_1` is called with an integer argument, and it returns two values which are assigned to `n` and `q`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new values of `n` and `q`. However, we know that `n` and `q` will now hold the values returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**
