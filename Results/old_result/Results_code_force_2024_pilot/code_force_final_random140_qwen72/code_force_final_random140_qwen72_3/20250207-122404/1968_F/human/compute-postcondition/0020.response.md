Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `i` is 0.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- The element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`.

Given these conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute and print the string 'Yes'.

Explanation:
- The condition that the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x` implies that the cumulative XOR up to these indices results in the same value.
- This condition is met, and the code simply prints 'Yes' without any further computation.

Output: **Yes**
