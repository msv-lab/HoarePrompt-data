Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `i` is 1.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.
- `upper` is the value at the position `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'No'`.
- The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
