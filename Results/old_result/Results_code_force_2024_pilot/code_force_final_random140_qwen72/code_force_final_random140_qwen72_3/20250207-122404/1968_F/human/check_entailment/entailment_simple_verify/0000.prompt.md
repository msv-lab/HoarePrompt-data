You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it determines if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the conditions under which it prints 'Yes' or 'No' are not fully aligned with the problem's requirements.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
       print('Yes')
       continue
   ```
   This check is correct because if the prefix XOR up to `l-1` is equal to the prefix XOR up to `r`, it means the XOR of the subarray `a[l] to a[r]` is zero, which is a valid case for being interesting.

2. **Binary Search and Condition Check**:
   ```python
   lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
   upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
   lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
   upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
   if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and (l <= lower <= r):
       print('Yes')
   else:
       print('No')
   ```

   The issue lies in the way `lower` and `upper` are determined and used. The binary search function `func_2` is used to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` in the lists `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]`, respectively. However, the logic to determine if the subarray is interesting is flawed.

   - **Flaw in `lower` and `upper` Calculation**:
     - `lower` is set to `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`, which might not be within the bounds `[l, r]`.
     - `upper` is set to `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, which might also not be within the bounds `[l, r]`.

   - **Flaw in Final Condition**:
     - The condition `if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and (l <= lower <= r):` is too restrictive and might miss valid cases where the subarray is interesting.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

For the query `(1, 5)`, the subarray is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]`. The program correctly identifies this as interesting.

However, for the query `(2, 4)`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`. The program fails to correctly identify this as interesting. The correct output should be `Yes` because the subarray can be split into `[1, 2]` and `[3]` with both parts having a XOR value of `3`.

### Conclusion

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically in determining if a subarray is interesting. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
