The code snippet `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` modifies the dictionary `inds` by appending the current length of the list `x` minus 1 to the list associated with the key `x[-1]`. Let's break down the changes:

- `inds` is a dictionary where the keys are the elements of `x` and the values are lists of indices.
- `x[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `x`.
- `len(x) - 1` gives the index of the last element in the list `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
- `i` is the first element of `a`.
- `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The dictionary `inds` is updated such that the key `x[-1]` (which is the last element of `x`) now has a list that includes the index of the last element of `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.**
