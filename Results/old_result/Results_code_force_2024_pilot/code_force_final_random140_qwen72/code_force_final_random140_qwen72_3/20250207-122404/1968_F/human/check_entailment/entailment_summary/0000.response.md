Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` is responsible for reading and parsing input. It takes a casting function (like `int`) and applies it to each element of the input line. This is a standard way to handle input in competitive programming and ensures that the input is correctly parsed.

2. **Binary Search (`func_2`)**:
   - `func_2` performs a binary search on a list `arr` using a predicate function. It returns the largest index where the predicate is true. This function is used to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary, which helps in determining if the subarray is interesting.

3. **Main Logic (`func_3`)**:
   - `func_3` processes the main logic of the problem. It reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the array `a` and computes the cumulative XOR values in the list `x`. The `inds` dictionary maps each unique XOR value to the indices where it occurs.
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if the subarray from `l-1` to `r-1` is interesting:
     - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the cumulative XOR from `l-1` to `r-1` is zero, and the subarray is interesting.
     - Otherwise, it uses `func_2` to find the appropriate indices in `inds` to check if there exists a valid partition. If such a partition exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. The use of cumulative XOR and binary search ensures efficient handling of the queries.

Correctness: **True**
