Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it determines if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the conditions under which it prints 'Yes' or 'No' are not fully aligned with the problem's requirements.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initial Check**:
   ```python
   if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
       print('Yes')
       continue
   ```
   This check is correct because if the prefix XOR up to `l-1` is equal to the prefix XOR up to `r`, it means the XOR of the subarray `a[l] to a[r]` is zero, which is a valid case for being interesting.

2. **Binary Search and Condition Check**:
   ```python
   lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
   upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
   lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
   upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
   if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and (l <= lower <= r):
       print('Yes')
   else:
       print('No')
   ```

   The issue lies in the way `lower` and `upper` are determined and used. The binary search function `func_2` is used to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` in the lists `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]`, respectively. However, the logic to determine if the subarray is interesting is flawed.

   - **Flaw in `lower` and `upper` Calculation**:
     - `lower` is set to `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`, which might not be within the bounds `[l, r]`.
     - `upper` is set to `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, which might also not be within the bounds `[l, r]`.

   - **Flaw in Final Condition**:
     - The condition `if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and (l <= lower <= r):` is too restrictive and might miss valid cases where the subarray is interesting.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

For the query `(1, 5)`, the subarray is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]`. The program correctly identifies this as interesting.

However, for the query `(2, 4)`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`. The program fails to correctly identify this as interesting. The correct output should be `Yes` because the subarray can be split into `[1, 2]` and `[3]` with both parts having a XOR value of `3`.

### Conclusion

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically in determining if a subarray is interesting. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
