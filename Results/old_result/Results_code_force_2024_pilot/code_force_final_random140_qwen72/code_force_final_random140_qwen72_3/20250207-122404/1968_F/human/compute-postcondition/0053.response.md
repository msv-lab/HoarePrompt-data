To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions leading up to the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the same as the initial value.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `q` is greater than 2.
   - `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `lower` is the third index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`, and `upper` is now set to the value of the element at the `upper` index in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.
   - If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins. Otherwise, the conditions are not met, and the loop continues normally.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('Yes')` statement is inside a loop or conditional block that checks certain conditions.
   - The conditions involve the values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` derived from the `inds` dictionary and the list `x`.
   - The key condition is whether `x[l - 1] == x[r]`. If this condition is true, the current iteration is skipped. If it is false, the loop continues, and the `print('Yes')` statement is executed.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical values they hold.
   - However, the print statement `print('Yes')` will execute if the condition `x[l - 1] != x[r]` is met.
   - Given the structure of the problem, the print statement will output "Yes" if the condition is satisfied.

Output: **Yes** (where the condition `x[l - 1] != x[r]` is met)
