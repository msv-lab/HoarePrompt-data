Output State: **`n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing a single element 0, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `inds` as a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. This means that accessing any key in `inds` that does not exist will automatically create an empty list for that key.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state, as the code only introduces the `inds` variable.
