Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `l, r = func_1(int)` updates the values of `l` and `r` to the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `q`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions involving `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` are not affected by this code snippet, as they depend on the values of `l` and `r` and the structure of `inds` and `x`, which are not modified here.
