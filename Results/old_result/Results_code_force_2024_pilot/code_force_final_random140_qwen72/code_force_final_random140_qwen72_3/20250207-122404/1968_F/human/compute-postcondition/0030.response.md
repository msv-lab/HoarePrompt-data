Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is the same as the initial value.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, then the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`.
   - `lower` is now the second largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or -1 if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Additionally, either `upper` is not greater than `lower`, or `l` is not less than or equal to `upper`, or `upper` is not less than or equal to `r`, or `l` is not less than or equal to `lower`, or `lower` is not less than or equal to `r`.

Given these conditions, the `print('No')` statement will always execute because the conditions described ensure that the logical constraints are met, leading to the conclusion that the conditions are always true.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
