Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then maps the `cast` function to each string, converting them to the desired type (typically `int`).
   - It correctly handles the input and returns an iterator of the converted values.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search on the list `arr` using the `predicate` function to find the largest index where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`.
   - It correctly handles the binary search logic and returns the appropriate index or `None` if no such index exists.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function processes the main logic of the problem:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads the array `a` and the number of queries `q`.
     - It computes the cumulative XOR of the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`.
     - It also builds a dictionary `inds` that maps each cumulative XOR value to the indices where it occurs.
     - For each query, it checks if the subarray from `l-1` to `r-1` is interesting by comparing the cumulative XOR values and using the `func_2` function to find the appropriate indices.
     - It correctly prints "Yes" if the subarray is interesting and "No" otherwise.
   - The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is correct:
     - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` is zero, which is a valid condition.
     - Otherwise, it uses the `func_2` function to find the indices and checks if the conditions for an interesting subarray are met.
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
