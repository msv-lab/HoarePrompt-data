The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. This means that the list `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` one more time.

Let's break down the changes:

- `inds[x[-1]]` is updated to include the index `len(x) - 1` again.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `i` is the third element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-2] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` twice, `inds[x[-2] ^ i]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, and `inds[x[-1]]` has been appended with the index `len(x) - 1`.**
