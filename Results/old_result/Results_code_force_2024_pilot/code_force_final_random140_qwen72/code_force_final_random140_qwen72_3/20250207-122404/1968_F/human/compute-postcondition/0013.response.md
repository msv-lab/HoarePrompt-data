Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `i` is the third element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-2] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, `inds[x[-2] ^ i]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, and `inds[x[-1]]` has been appended with the index `len(x) - 1`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is extended by appending the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to it. This new element is the XOR of the last element in `x` and the third element of `a`.
- The index `len(x) - 1` (which is the index of the newly added element in `x`) is appended to `inds[x[-1]]` and `inds[x[-2] ^ i]`.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
