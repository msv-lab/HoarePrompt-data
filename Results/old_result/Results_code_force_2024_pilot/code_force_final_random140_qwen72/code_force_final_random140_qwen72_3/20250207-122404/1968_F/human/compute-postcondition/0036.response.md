Postcondition: ***`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
