To solve this, let's break down the code and its impact on the program state:

- `lower` is assigned the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1`.
- `func_2` is called with two arguments: `inds[x[r]]` (a list of indices where `x[r]` appears in `x`) and a lambda function that checks if an argument is less than `l`.
- If `func_2` returns a non-false value (i.e., a value that is not `None`, `False`, `0`, or an empty collection), `lower` is set to that value. Otherwise, `lower` is set to `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `i` is 1.
- `q` must be greater than 1.
- `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.

If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the state of the program remains unchanged. However, since the condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is not explicitly stated to be true, we proceed with the assignment of `lower`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`inds[x[r]]`**: This retrieves the list of indices where `x[r]` appears in `x`.
2. **`lambda arg: arg < l`**: This lambda function filters the list of indices to include only those that are less than `l`.
3. **`func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)`**: This function call filters the list of indices and returns the first index that satisfies the condition `arg < l`. If no such index exists, it returns `None`.
4. **`or -1`**: If `func_2` returns `None`, `lower` is set to `-1`. Otherwise, `lower` is set to the filtered index.

### Output State:
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `x` remains a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` remains a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `q` remains greater than 1.
- `l` and `r` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is set to the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.

Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.**
