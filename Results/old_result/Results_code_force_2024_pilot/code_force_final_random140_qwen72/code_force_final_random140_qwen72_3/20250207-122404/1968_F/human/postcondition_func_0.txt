The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `cast`, which is expected to be a callable (e.g., `int`, `float`). It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into a list of strings based on whitespace, and then returns an iterator. This iterator applies the `cast` function to each string in the list, converting each string to the type specified by `cast`. The final state of the program includes the returned iterator, which can be used to access the converted values one by one.
