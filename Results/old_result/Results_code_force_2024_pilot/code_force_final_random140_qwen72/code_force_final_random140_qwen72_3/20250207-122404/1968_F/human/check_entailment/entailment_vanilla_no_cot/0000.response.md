Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It uses prefix XORs to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray and employs binary search to find suitable indices for checking the conditions of the problem. The solution handles the constraints and input/output format as specified.
