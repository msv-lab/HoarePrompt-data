You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a callable that can convert string inputs to the desired type, typically int or float.
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element in the list of strings obtained from splitting the user input. Each element in the iterator is the result of converting a string from the input into the type specified by `cast`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `cast`, which is expected to be a callable (e.g., `int`, `float`). It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into a list of strings based on whitespace, and then returns an iterator. This iterator applies the `cast` function to each string in the list, converting each string to the type specified by `cast`. The final state of the program includes the returned iterator, which can be used to access the converted values one by one.

    #State: The loop terminates when `l + 1 >= r`. At this point, `l` and `r` are such that `l` is the largest index where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`, and `r` is the smallest index where `predicate(arr[r])` is `False`, or vice versa depending on the initial conditions and the behavior of the `predicate` function. The values of `arr` and `predicate` remain unchanged.

        return l
        #The program returns the largest index `l` where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`.
    #State: The loop terminates when `l + 1 >= r`. At this point, `l` and `r` are such that `l` is the largest index where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`, and `r` is the smallest index where `predicate(arr[r])` is `False`, or vice versa depending on the initial conditions and the behavior of the `predicate` function. The values of `arr` and `predicate` remain unchanged. Additionally, `predicate(arr[l])` is `False`.
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the largest index `l` where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. If no such index exists, it returns `None`. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the predicate function `predicate`.

    #State: `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` processes a list `a` of `n` integers and a series of `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines whether there exists a subarray within `a` from index `l-1` to `r-1` (inclusive) whose cumulative XOR is zero. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all queries, the function maintains the original values of `n` and `q`, and the list `a` remains unchanged. The list `x` contains the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to each index, and `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique XOR value to the indices where it occurs in `x`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray \(a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r\) can be divided into \(k > 1\) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - This involves checking if there exists a way to partition the subarray such that the XOR of elements in each part is equal.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray \(a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r\) using `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search for Indices:**
   - The program uses binary search to find indices in the prefix XOR array that match the required conditions.
   - Specifically, it checks if there are indices `lower` and `upper` such that `x[lower] == x[r]` and `x[upper] == x[l-1]` within the range `[l, r]`.

4. **Conditions for "Interesting" Subarray:**
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, the subarray is trivially interesting because the entire subarray has a XOR of zero, which can be split into multiple parts with XOR zero.
   - Otherwise, the program checks if there are indices `lower` and `upper` such that `upper > lower` and both indices are within the range `[l, r]`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the indices are within the valid range and that the conditions for "interesting" subarrays are met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the constraints and edge cases.
