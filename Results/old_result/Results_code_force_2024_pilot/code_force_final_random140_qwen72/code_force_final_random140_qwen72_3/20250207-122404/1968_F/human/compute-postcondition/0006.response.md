The code snippet `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends the result of the XOR operation between the last element of the list `x` and the variable `i` to the list `x`.

- `n` is at least 1, so `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `i` is the first element of `a`.
- `x` must already exist and have at least one element for the operation `x[-1]` to be valid.

Given these conditions, the new element appended to `x` is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 â‰¤ a_i < 2^30, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.**
