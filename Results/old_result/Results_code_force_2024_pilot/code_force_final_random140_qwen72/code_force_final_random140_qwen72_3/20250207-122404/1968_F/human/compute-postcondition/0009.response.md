Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `i` is the second element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, `inds[x[-2] ^ i]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is at least 1.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and contains `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- The variable `i` remains the second element of `a`.
- The list `x` has one additional element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` (`x[-1]`) and `i` (`x[-1] ^ i`).
- The dictionary `inds` is updated to include the index `len(x) - 1` for the new last element of `x` (`x[-1]`).
- Additionally, `inds` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` for the value `x[-2] ^ i`, which is the new last element of `x`.
