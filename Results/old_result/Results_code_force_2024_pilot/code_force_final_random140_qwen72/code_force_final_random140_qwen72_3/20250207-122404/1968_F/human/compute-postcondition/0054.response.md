Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: This is the length of the list `a`.
2. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers where each integer \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. **`x`**: A list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
4. **`inds`**: A defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
5. **`i`**: Set to 2.
6. **`q`**: Greater than 2.
7. **`l` and `r`**: New values returned by `func_1(int)`.
8. **`lower`**: The third index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.
9. **`upper`**: The largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. It is then set to the value of the element at the `upper` index in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.
10. **Condition**: If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins. Otherwise, the conditions are not met, and the loop continues normally.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but it does not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'No'` regardless of the initial state.

Output: **No**
