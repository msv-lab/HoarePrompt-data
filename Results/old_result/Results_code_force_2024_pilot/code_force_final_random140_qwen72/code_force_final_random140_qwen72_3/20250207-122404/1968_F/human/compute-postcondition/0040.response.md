The code snippet `upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]` updates the value of `upper` by accessing the `inds` dictionary using the key `x[l - 1]` and then indexing into the list of indices stored at that key using the current value of `upper`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `i` is 1.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.
- `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`, or `-1` if no such index exists.

After executing the code snippet:
- `upper` is updated to the value at the position `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists, `upper` is the value at the position `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.**
