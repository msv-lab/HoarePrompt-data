Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`, or `-1` if no such index exists.**

Explanation:
- The line `lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]` updates the value of `lower` to the next index in the list `inds[x[r]]` after the current `lower` value.
- If `lower` was initially the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, then after executing the code, `lower` becomes the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.
- If there is no such index (i.e., `lower` was already `-1` or the next index does not exist), `lower` remains `-1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `upper`) remain unchanged.
