Functionality: ** The function `func_3` processes a list `a` of `n` integers and a series of `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines whether there exists a subarray within `a` from index `l-1` to `r-1` (inclusive) whose cumulative XOR is zero. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all queries, the function maintains the original values of `n` and `q`, and the list `a` remains unchanged. The list `x` contains the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to each index, and `inds` is a dictionary mapping each unique XOR value to the indices where it occurs in `x`. **
