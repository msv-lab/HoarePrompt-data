### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray \(a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r\) can be divided into \(k > 1\) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - This involves checking if there exists a way to partition the subarray such that the XOR of elements in each part is equal.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray \(a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r\) using `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search for Indices:**
   - The program uses binary search to find indices in the prefix XOR array that match the required conditions.
   - Specifically, it checks if there are indices `lower` and `upper` such that `x[lower] == x[r]` and `x[upper] == x[l-1]` within the range `[l, r]`.

4. **Conditions for "Interesting" Subarray:**
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, the subarray is trivially interesting because the entire subarray has a XOR of zero, which can be split into multiple parts with XOR zero.
   - Otherwise, the program checks if there are indices `lower` and `upper` such that `upper > lower` and both indices are within the range `[l, r]`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the indices are within the valid range and that the conditions for "interesting" subarrays are met.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly constructs the prefix XOR array `x` and the dictionary `inds` to store indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - The binary search function `func_2` is used to find the appropriate indices efficiently.
   - The main loop processes each query and correctly checks the conditions for an "interesting" subarray.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the constraints and edge cases.

Final: **True**
