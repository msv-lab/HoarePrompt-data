Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is "interesting" based on the bitwise XOR of its segments. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The main block reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1(int)`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_3()` to process the test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers using the provided `cast` function (which is `int` in this context).
   - It returns an iterator of integers, which is used to read the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function performs a binary search on the list `arr` using a `predicate` function.
   - It returns the largest index `l` where `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`, or `None` if no such index exists.
   - This function is used to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary for the XOR values.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - Reads the list of integers `a`.
   - Initializes a list `x` to store the cumulative XOR values and a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of these XOR values.
   - For each element in `a`, it updates the cumulative XOR and stores the index in `inds`.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` is interesting:
     - If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, it prints 'Yes' because the subarray can be split into segments with the same XOR value.
     - Otherwise, it uses `func_2` to find the appropriate indices in `inds` and checks if the conditions for an interesting subarray are met.
     - If the conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Key Points:
- **Cumulative XOR Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the cumulative XOR values and stores them in `x`.
- **Index Storage**: The program correctly stores the indices of each cumulative XOR value in `inds`.
- **Query Handling**: The program correctly handles each query by checking the cumulative XOR values and using binary search to find the appropriate indices.

### Potential Issues:
- **Binary Search Usage**: The binary search in `func_2` is used to find the appropriate indices, but it might be more complex than necessary. However, it seems to work correctly in the context of the problem.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when the subarray is already interesting without further splitting.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
