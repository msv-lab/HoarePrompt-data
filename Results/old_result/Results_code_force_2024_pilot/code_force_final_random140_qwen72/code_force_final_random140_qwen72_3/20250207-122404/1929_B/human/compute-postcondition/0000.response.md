Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which must be between 1 and 1000. The conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
