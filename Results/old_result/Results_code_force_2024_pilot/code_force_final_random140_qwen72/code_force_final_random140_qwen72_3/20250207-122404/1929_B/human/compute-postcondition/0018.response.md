Output State: **`t` is 0, and the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `n` and `k` were input integers. If `k` was an even number such that when divided by 2, the result was an odd number, then `k // 2 + 1` was printed. Otherwise, if `k` was odd or divisible by 4, then `ceil(k / 2)` was printed.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the value of `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` implicitly with each iteration. For each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` were provided as input, and the appropriate value was printed based on the conditions specified in the loop.
