To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this doesn't directly affect the calculation).
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- Either `k` is odd or `k` is divisible by 4.

### Code:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `k`**:
   - If `k` is odd, then `k / 2` will result in a non-integer value (e.g., 3 / 2 = 1.5).
   - If `k` is divisible by 4, then `k / 2` will result in an integer value (e.g., 8 / 2 = 4).

2. **Ceiling Function**:
   - The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds up to the nearest integer.
   - For an odd `k`, `ceil(k / 2)` will round up the non-integer result to the next integer.
   - For a `k` divisible by 4, `ceil(k / 2)` will return the same integer value since it is already an integer.

### Possible Values:
- If `k` is odd, say `k = 3`, then `k / 2 = 1.5` and `ceil(1.5) = 2`.
- If `k` is divisible by 4, say `k = 8`, then `k / 2 = 4` and `ceil(4) = 4`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will be the ceiling of `k / 2`, which depends on whether `k` is odd or divisible by 4. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these conditions.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where k is an input integer that is either odd or divisible by 4)**
