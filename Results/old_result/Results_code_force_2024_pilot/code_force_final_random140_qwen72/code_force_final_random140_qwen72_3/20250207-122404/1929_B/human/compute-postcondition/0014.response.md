Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, while `t` remains greater than 0 and is specifically `t - 1`. The conditions regarding `k` being even or its half being odd are not relevant to the current code snippet.
