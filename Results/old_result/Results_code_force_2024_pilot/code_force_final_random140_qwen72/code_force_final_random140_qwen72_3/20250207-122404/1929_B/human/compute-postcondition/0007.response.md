Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is an odd number, then the specific actions for the if part are taken. Otherwise, if `k` is odd or divisible by 4, then the specific actions for the else part are taken.***
