Based on the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0 (though this doesn't directly affect the calculation).
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is an odd number.

Let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

1. **Understanding `k`:**
   - Since `k` is an even number, it can be expressed as `k = 2m` where `m` is an integer.
   - According to the precondition, when `k` is divided by 2, the result is an odd number. Therefore, `m` must be an odd number. Let's denote `m` as `2p + 1` where `p` is an integer.

2. **Calculating `k // 2`:**
   - `k // 2` means integer division of `k` by 2.
   - Substituting `k = 2m` into the expression, we get `k // 2 = m`.
   - Since `m` is an odd number, let's say `m = 2p + 1`.

3. **Adding 1 to the result:**
   - The expression becomes `k // 2 + 1 = m + 1`.
   - Substituting `m = 2p + 1`, we get `k // 2 + 1 = (2p + 1) + 1 = 2p + 2`.

4. **Final Result:**
   - `2p + 2` is always an even number because it is 2 times an integer plus 2.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output an even number, specifically `2p + 2`.

Output: **2p + 2 (where p is an integer such that k = 2(2p + 1))**
