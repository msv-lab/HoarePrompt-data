The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2, representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively.

The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the function should return some result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the square grid, and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given `n` and `k`.**
