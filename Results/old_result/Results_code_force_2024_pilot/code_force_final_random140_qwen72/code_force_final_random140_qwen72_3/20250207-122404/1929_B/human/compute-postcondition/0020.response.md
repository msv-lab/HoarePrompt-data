Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the size of a square grid and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. The function then calculates and prints a value for each test case: if `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is an odd number, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and `t` is effectively 0 (as it has been fully iterated over). The function does not return any values; it only prints results to the console. **
