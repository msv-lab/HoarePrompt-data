Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` have been updated to new input integers.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `k // 2 + 1`:
- `k` is an integer.
- `k // 2` performs integer division, which means it divides `k` by 2 and truncates the result to the nearest whole number towards zero.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` gives the final value to be printed.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **(k // 2 + 1) (where k is the updated value of k)**
