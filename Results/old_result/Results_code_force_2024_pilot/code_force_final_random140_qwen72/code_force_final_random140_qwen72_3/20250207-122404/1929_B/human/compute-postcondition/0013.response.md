The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the loop counter `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and it has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Since the loop uses `_` as a dummy variable, it does not affect the loop's execution. The key variable here is `t`, which needs to be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), and `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers, regardless of whether `k` is even and its half is odd or not.**
