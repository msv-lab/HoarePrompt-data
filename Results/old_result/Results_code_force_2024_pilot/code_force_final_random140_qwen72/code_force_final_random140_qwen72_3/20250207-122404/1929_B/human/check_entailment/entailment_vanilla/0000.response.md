### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A diagonal can be either a main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) or an anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each cell in the grid belongs to exactly two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to maximize the number of diagonals covered by each colored cell.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks if \( k \) is even and if \( k // 2 \) is odd.
     - If both conditions are true, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of the program is based on the idea that each cell covers two diagonals.
   - If \( k \) is even and \( k // 2 \) is odd, the program adds 1 to \( k // 2 \) to ensure that the number of cells is sufficient to cover \( k \) diagonals.
   - For other cases, it simply takes the ceiling of \( k / 2 \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 2 \) by ensuring that the number of cells required does not exceed the total number of diagonals.
   - However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 2 \), but since the problem constraints guarantee \( 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 \), this is not an issue.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), the program outputs 2, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \), the program outputs 2, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), the program outputs 6, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \), the program outputs 5, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \), the program outputs 4, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \), the program outputs 6, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the program outputs 2, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed to be colored to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The logic and edge cases are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
