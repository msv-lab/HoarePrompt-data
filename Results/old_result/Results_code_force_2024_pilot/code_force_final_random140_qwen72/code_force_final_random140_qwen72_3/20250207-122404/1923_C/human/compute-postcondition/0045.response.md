Based on the initial state provided, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state describes several operations and updates to variables (`onesInRange`, `sumInRange`, `l`, `r`, `_`), but none of these affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is simply printing a hardcoded string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
