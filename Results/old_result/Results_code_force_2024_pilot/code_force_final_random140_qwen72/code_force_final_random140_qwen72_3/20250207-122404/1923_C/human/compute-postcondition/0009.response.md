Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` is 0, and `ones[2]` is `ones[1] + (1 if nums[1] == 1 else 0)`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, `sum[1]` is now `nums[0]`, `sum[2]` is now `sum[1] + nums[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` list at index `i` (which is 2) to be the sum of the value at `sum[i - 1]` (which is `sum[1]`) and the value at `nums[i - 1]` (which is `nums[1]`). Therefore, `sum[2]` is now `sum[1] + nums[1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
