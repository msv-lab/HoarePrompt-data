The code snippet updates the `sum` list by adding the value of `nums[i - 1]` to the previous element in the `sum` list. Let's break down the impact:

- `sum[i]` is updated to be the sum of `sum[i - 1]` and `nums[i - 1]`.
- The value of `i` is 1, so `sum[1]` is updated to `sum[0] + nums[0]`.
- Since `sum[0]` is 0 (as per the initial state), `sum[1]` becomes `nums[0]`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` is 0, `sum` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, `sum[1]` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0.**
