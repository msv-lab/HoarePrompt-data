Postcondition: ***`onesInRange` is set to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is set to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`; all other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.***
