The provided `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects being evaluated or printed in this specific statement. The initial state describes various operations and conditions that affect the variables `onesInRange`, `sumInRange`, `l`, `r`, and `_`, but these do not influence the output of the `print` statement directly.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
