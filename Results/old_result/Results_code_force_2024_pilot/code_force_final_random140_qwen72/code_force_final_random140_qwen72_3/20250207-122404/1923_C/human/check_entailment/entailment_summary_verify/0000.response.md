### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Prefix Sums and Ones Count:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly precomputes the prefix sums (`sum`) and the cumulative count of 1s (`ones`). This allows for efficient querying of the sum and count of 1s within any subarray.
   - The prefix sums and ones count are computed using the following loops:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
         sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
     ```

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function reads the range `[l, r]` and checks if the subarray is good.
   - The condition for a subarray to be good is:
     - The subarray must have more than one element (`if l == r: print('NO')`).
     - The sum of the subarray must be sufficient to allow the creation of a `b` array that satisfies the conditions:
       - The sum of the subarray should be at least twice the number of 1s plus the number of elements minus the number of 1s.
       - This is checked using the condition:
         ```python
         if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
             print('YES')
         else:
             print('NO')
         ```

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to:
     - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
   - This ensures that the sum of the subarray is at least the number of 1s plus the number of elements in the subarray, which is necessary to create a `b` array where each element is different from the corresponding element in the subarray and all elements in `b` are positive.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element (`if l == r: print('NO')`), as a single-element subarray cannot be good.
   - The program also handles the case where the subarray has multiple elements and checks the sum condition accurately.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. It efficiently precomputes the necessary values and checks the conditions for each query.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
