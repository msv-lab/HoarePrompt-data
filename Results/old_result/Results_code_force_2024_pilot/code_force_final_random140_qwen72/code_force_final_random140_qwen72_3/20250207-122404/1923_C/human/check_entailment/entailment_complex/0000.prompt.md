Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

            print('YES')

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` remains a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` remains a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` remains a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` remains a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` remains `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `q` must be greater than or equal to 0. The loop has executed `q` times, and for each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` were taken from user input, and the conditions within the loop were checked and printed accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of a list `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads a list of integers `nums` of length `n`. The function calculates two auxiliary lists: `ones`, which stores the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to each index, and `sum`, which stores the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to each index. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a range `[l, r]` and checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts of 1s and the sum of elements in the range `[l, r]` respectively. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function completes without returning any value.
