The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range defined by `q`. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment the value of `_` by 1 for the next iteration to occur, assuming `q` remains unchanged.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the variable `_` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to proceed to the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `_` must be less than `q`.

State: **`onesInRange` is set to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is set to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`; all other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `q`.**
