Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the criteria specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `c` and the number of queries.
   - It then reads the array `c` and initializes two auxiliary arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s and the cumulative sum of the elements in the array, respectively.

2. **Cumulative Arrays**:
   - The `ones` array is used to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 up to each index.
   - The `sum` array is used to store the cumulative sum of the elements up to each index.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` is good.
   - If the subarray has only one element (`l == r`), it prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition `a_i != b_i`.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the elements in the subarray (`sumInRange`).
   - It then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds. This condition ensures that it is possible to construct an array `b` such that the sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray and no element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the subarray is good and "NO" otherwise.

The logic and implementation are correct, and the program efficiently handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
