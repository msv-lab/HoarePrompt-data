The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the length of the list `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
  - `c`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `queries`: A list of `q` pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)`, where each pair represents a query and satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and each query within the test case, and returns the results of the queries. The specific output for each query is not detailed in the provided information, but it is assumed to be based on the elements of the list `c` within the range specified by the query `(l_i, r_i)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the length of a list `c`, the list itself, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It processes each query and returns the results based on the elements of `c` within the specified ranges.**
