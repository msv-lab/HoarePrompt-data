Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently by calling `func_1()`. This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases as specified.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Cumulative Sums (`sum`)**: The program calculates the cumulative sum of the elements in the array `nums` and stores it in the list `sum`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray.
   - **Count of 1s (`ones`)**: The program also calculates the cumulative count of 1s in the array `nums` and stores it in the list `ones`. This allows for efficient computation of the number of 1s in any subarray.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the range `[l, r]`.
   - It checks if the range consists of a single element (`l == r`). If so, it immediately prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be "good" as per the problem statement.
   - It calculates the number of 1s in the subarray (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
   - It then checks the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\). This condition ensures that there exists a valid array `b` such that the sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray, all elements of `b` are positive, and no element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the above reasoning, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and produce the correct output for the given example and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
