The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the condition `i < n + 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` is 0, and `ones[2]` is `ones[1] + (1 if nums[1] == 1 else 0)`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, `sum[1]` is now `nums[0]`, `sum[2]` is now `sum[1] + nums[1]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
