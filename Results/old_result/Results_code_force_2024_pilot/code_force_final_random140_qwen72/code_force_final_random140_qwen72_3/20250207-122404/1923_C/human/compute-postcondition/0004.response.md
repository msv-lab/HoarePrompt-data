To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, and `i` will start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9
- For each of the q queries, l_i and r_i are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `ones` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0
- `sum` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, and `i` should start at 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, for each of the q queries, l_i and r_i are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, `sum` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
