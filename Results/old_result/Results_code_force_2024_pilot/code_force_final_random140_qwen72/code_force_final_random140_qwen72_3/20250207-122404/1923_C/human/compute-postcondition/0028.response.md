Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l-1` to `r-1` in the `nums` list, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. The new values of `l` and `r` are now the input integers provided.
