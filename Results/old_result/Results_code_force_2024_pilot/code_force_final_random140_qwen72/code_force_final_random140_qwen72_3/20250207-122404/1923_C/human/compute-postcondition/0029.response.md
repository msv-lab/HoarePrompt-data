To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `q` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l-1` to `r-1` in the `nums` list.
   - `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

2. **Condition:**
   - If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, the condition holds true.
   - Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('NO')`.

Given the condition and the print statement, the output will always be 'NO' because the print statement does not depend on the condition. The condition is only described but not used in the print statement.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
