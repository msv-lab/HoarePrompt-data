Based on the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `q` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is within the range 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`.
- `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are input integers.
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l-1` to `r-1` in the `nums` list.
- `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds true.

Given that the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is explicitly stated to hold true, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
