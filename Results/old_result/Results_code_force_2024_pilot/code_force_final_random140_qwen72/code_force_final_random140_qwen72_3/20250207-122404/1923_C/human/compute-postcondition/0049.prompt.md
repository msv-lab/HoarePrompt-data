You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each of the q queries, l_i and r_i are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` remains a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` remains a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` remains a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` remains a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` remains a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` remains a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` remains `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `q` must be greater than or equal to 0. The loop has executed `q` times, and for each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` were taken from user input, and the conditions within the loop were checked and printed accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the length of a list `c`, the list itself, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It processes each query and returns the results based on the elements of `c` within the specified ranges.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
