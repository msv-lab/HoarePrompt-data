Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `cnt` is 2 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 3 if they were equal when `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`. If `l1[i]` does not equal `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 1 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 2 if they were equal, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
