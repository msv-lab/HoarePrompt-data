Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the length of the longest common subsegment of two infinite sequences defined by the bitwise XOR operation with two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \). The key insight here is that the sequences \( a_n = n \oplus x \) and \( b_n = n \oplus y \) will have a common subsegment if and only if the binary representations of \( x \) and \( y \) share a common prefix. The length of this common subsegment is \( 2^k \), where \( k \) is the length of the common prefix in the binary representations of \( x \) and \( y \).

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( x \) and \( y \).
3. It converts \( x \) and \( y \) to their binary representations by repeatedly taking the remainder when divided by 2 and then dividing by 2.
4. It ensures both binary representations are of equal length by appending zeros if necessary.
5. It counts the length of the common prefix by comparing the binary digits from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.
6. It prints \( 2 \) raised to the power of the length of the common prefix.

This approach is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
