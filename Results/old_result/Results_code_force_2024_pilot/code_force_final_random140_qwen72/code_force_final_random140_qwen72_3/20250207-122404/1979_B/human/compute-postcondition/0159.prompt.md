You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        l1, l2 = [], []
        
        while x:
            l1.append(x % 2)
            x //= 2
        
        while y:
            l2.append(y % 2)
            y //= 2
        
        if len(l2) < len(l1):
            l2.append(0)
        elif len(l1) < len(l2):
            l1.append(0)
        
        n = len(l1)
        
        if len(l2) < len(l1):
            n = len(l2)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if l1[i] == l2[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(2 ** cnt)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the last `x` and `y` inputs in reverse order, respectively. If the lengths of `l1` and `l2` were unequal, the shorter list was padded with a 0 to match the length of the longer list. `n` is the length of the longer list, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched, and `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are distinct non-negative integers within the range 0 to 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
