The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is initially 2 if `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0. After executing the code, the value of `cnt` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended to it, making `len(l2)` equal to `len(l1)`, `n` is equal to `len(l1)`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, if `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
