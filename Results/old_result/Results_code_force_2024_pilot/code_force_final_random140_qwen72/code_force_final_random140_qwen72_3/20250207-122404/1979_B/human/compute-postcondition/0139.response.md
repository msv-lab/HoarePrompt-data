Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order. If `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended to it, making `len(l2)` equal to `len(l1)`. In this case, `n` is equal to `len(l1)`, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, and `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, the lists remain unchanged, and `n` is equal to the length of `l1`.***
