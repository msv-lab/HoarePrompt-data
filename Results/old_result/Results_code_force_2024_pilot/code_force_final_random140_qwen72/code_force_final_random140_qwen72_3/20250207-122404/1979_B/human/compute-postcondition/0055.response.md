The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be non-zero.

State: **`x` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of the original `l1`, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the original `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is `n - 1` if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit**
