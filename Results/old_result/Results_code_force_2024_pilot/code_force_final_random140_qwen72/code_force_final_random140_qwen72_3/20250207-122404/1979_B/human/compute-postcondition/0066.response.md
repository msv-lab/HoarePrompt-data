Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is a non-zero integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit of `y`, `n` is the length of the binary representation of the original `x`, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**

Explanation:
- The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the least significant bit (LSB) of `y` to the list `l2`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new state of `l2` is now a list containing the LSB of `y`.
