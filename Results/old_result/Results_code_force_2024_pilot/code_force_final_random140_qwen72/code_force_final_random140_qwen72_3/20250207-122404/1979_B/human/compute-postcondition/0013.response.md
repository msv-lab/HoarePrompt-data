Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the same input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero. In each iteration, the remainder of `x` when divided by 2 (i.e., the least significant bit of `x` in binary form) is appended to the list `l1`, and then `x` is updated to its integer division by 2 (i.e., the binary digits of `x` are shifted right by one position). This process repeats until `x` becomes 0. At the end of the loop, `l1` contains the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, and `x` itself is 0. The variables `y`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
