Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended to it, making `len(l2)` equal to `len(l1)`, in this case, `n` is equal to `len(l1)`, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current values of `l1[i]` and `l2[i]` are equal.**
