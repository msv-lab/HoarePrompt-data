Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: Remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`y`**: Becomes 0 after the loop finishes executing. The loop continues as long as `y` is non-zero, and each iteration divides `y` by 2 (using integer division). Eventually, `y` will become 0, causing the loop to terminate.
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l1`**: Remains a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l2`**: Contains the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order. Each iteration appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 (`y % 2`) to `l2`, which effectively builds the binary representation of `y` in reverse order. When the loop terminates, `l2` will contain all the binary digits of the original `y`.
