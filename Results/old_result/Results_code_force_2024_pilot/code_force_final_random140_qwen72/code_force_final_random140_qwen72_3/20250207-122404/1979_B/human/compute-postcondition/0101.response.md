Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of the longer list (`l1` or `l2`), `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if the elements at the current index `i` in `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If the elements at the current index `i` in `l1` and `l2` are not equal, the loop breaks, and `i` will be the index of the first differing bit.
- If all bits match, `cnt` will be equal to `n`, and `i` will be `n`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
