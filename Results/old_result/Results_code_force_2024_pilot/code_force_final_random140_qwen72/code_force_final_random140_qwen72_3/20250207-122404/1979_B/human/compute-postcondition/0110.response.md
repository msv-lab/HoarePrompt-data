Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2` and must be non-zero, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2, x % 2]` (where `x` is the new value of `x`), `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of the longer list (`l1` or `l2`), `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**

Explanation:
- The code `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`.
- Initially, `l1` contains `[x % 2]` where `x` is the new value of `x` (i.e., `x // 2`).
- After appending, `l1` now contains `[x % 2, x % 2]` where `x` is the new value of `x`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
