The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists. The value of `i` is `n - 1` if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**
