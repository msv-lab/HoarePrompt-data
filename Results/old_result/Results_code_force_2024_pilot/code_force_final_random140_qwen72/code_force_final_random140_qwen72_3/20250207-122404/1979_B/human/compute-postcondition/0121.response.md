The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the result of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` is defined as `y // 2` and must be greater than 0, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1. This means that `l2` will now contain one additional element, which is the result of `y % 2`.

Let's break down the impact on the variables:

- `l2` is updated to include the new element `y % 2`.
- The length of `l2` increases by 1.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is 0, `y` is `y // 2` and must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2, y % 2]`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**
