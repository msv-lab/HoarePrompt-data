The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial values of `x` and `y` (both 0) are replaced by the new values provided by the user. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `cnt`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is `n - 1` if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**
