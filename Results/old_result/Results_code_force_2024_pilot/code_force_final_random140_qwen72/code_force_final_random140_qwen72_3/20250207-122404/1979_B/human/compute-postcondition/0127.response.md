Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: Remains 0 throughout the loop as it is not modified.
- **`y`**: Continues to be divided by 2 in each iteration until it becomes 0. When `y` reaches 0, the loop condition (`while y`) fails, and the loop terminates.
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l1`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l2`**: Initially empty, this list accumulates the binary digits of `y` in reverse order as the loop appends `y % 2` to it in each iteration. By the end of the loop, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order.
- **`n`**: Remains the length of `l1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt`**: Remains the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched, as it is not modified within the loop.
