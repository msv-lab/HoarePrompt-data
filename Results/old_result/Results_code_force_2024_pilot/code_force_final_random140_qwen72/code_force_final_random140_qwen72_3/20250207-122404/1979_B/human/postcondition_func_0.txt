The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It then computes the longest common prefix in the binary representation of `x` and `y`, and prints `2` raised to the power of the length of this common prefix. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
