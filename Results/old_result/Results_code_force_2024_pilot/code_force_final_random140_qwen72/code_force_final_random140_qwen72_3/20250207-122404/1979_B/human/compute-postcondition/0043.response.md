The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was either 0 or 1, depending on whether the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal or were equal, respectively. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` will be 1 if the original value was 0, or 2 if the original value was 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 2 if they were equal.**
