Output State: **`x` is the original `x` divided by 8 (integer division) and `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the last two bits of the original `x` and the new bit from `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to be the original `x` divided by 8 (integer division) because `x` was already divided by 4 initially, and now it is divided by 2 again.
- All other variables (`y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation `x //= 2`.
