Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order. If `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended to it, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` remains unchanged. `n` is the length of the longer list (`l1` or `l2`), `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
