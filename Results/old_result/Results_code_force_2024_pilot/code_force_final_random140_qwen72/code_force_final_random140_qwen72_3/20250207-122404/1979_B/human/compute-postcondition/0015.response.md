The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to the list `l2`. Since `y` is a non-zero integer, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1. The list `l2` was initially empty, so after executing this code, `l2` will contain one element, which is the remainder of `y` divided by 2.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the same input integer and must be non-zero, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2` (which is either 0 or 1).**
