The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the value `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `cnt` is 1 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 2 if they were equal.**
