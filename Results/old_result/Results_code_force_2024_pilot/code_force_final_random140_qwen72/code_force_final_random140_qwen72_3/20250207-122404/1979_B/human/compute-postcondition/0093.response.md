The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the value `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
