To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 ** cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order.
   - `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order.
   - `n` is the length of the longer list (`l1` or `l2`).
   - `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match.
   - `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.

2. **Binary Representations:**
   - Since `x` is 0, the binary representation of `x` is `0`.
   - Since `y` is 0, the binary representation of `y` is `0`.
   - Therefore, `l1` and `l2` are both `[0]`.

3. **Length of Lists:**
   - Both `l1` and `l2` have a length of 1.
   - Hence, `n` is 1.

4. **Matching Bits:**
   - Since both `l1` and `l2` are `[0]`, they are identical.
   - Therefore, `cnt` is the length of the lists, which is 1.

5. **First Differing Bit:**
   - Since all bits match, `i` is 1.

6. **Calculation:**
   - The `print(2 ** cnt)` statement will print `2` raised to the power of `cnt`.
   - Given that `cnt` is 1, `2 ** 1` is 2.

Therefore, the output of the `print(2 ** cnt)` statement is:
Output: **2**
