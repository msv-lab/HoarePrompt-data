The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is the original input integer divided by 4 (and rounded down to the nearest integer). For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must still be non-zero.

Since the original input integer divided by 4 (and rounded down) is already given as the value of `y`, and since this value is used directly in the loop condition, no further adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute one more time, assuming the original input integer was such that `y` is non-zero.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the original input integer divided by 4 (and rounded down to the nearest integer), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the values `y % 2` (which is either 0 or 1) repeated twice**.
