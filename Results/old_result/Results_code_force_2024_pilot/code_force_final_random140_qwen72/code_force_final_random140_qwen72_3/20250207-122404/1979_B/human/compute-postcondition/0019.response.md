The value of `y` is updated by performing an integer division by 2, which means `y` is reduced to half its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the original input integer divided by 4 (and rounded down to the nearest integer), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the values `y % 2` (which is either 0 or 1) repeated twice.**
