The variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is the original value of `y` divided by 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must still be non-zero.

State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the original value of `y` divided by 4 and must be non-zero, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit of the original `y` followed by the new least significant bit of `y` (which is `y % 2`), `n` is the length of the binary representation of the original `x`, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**
