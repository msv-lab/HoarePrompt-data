Output State: **`x` is the integer division of the original `x` by 8 and must be greater than or equal to 2, `y` is the same input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is [original `x` % 2, (original `x` // 2) % 2, (original `x` // 4) % 2], `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of its original value by 2. Since the initial state specifies that `x` is the integer division of the original `x` by 4 and must be greater than or equal to 4, dividing `x` by 2 again results in `x` being the integer division of the original `x` by 8. This new value of `x` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- The values of `y`, `t`, `_`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
- The list `l1` remains the same, but the last element, which was originally `x % 2`, now corresponds to `(original `x` // 4) % 2` because `x` has been updated.
