Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the original input integer divided by 8 (and rounded down to the nearest integer), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the values `y % 2` (which is either 0 or 1) repeated three times.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `y // 2`, which means `y` is now the original input integer divided by 8 (and rounded down to the nearest integer).
- All other variables (`x`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, and `l2`) remain unchanged.
