Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is `y // 2` (still greater than 0 but now half of its previous value), `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**
