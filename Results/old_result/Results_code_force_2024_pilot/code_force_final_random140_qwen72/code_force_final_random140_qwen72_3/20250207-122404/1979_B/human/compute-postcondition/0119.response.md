Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is `y // 2`, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `y // 2`, which means `y` is now the integer division of its original value by 2.
- All other variables (`x`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
