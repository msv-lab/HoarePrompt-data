### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - For example, if \( n = 12 \), the numbers on the board after replacement are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, and their sum is 51.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program initializes a variable `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive), which means it processes the numbers 0 through 12.
   - For each number \( i \) in this range, it calls the function `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of the digits of the number \( n \).

3. **Checking the Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly converts the number \( n \) to a string, iterates over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up.
   - This function works correctly for any non-negative integer \( n \).

4. **Checking the Loop:**
   - The loop `for i in range(13)` iterates from 0 to 12, which is not the same as iterating from 1 to \( n \) as required by the problem statement.
   - The problem specifies that \( n \) ranges from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \), but the loop only goes up to 12.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the input format.
   - The input format states that there can be up to \( 10^4 \) test cases, each with a different value of \( n \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem because it only processes the numbers from 0 to 12, instead of processing the numbers from 1 to \( n \) for each test case.
   - Additionally, the program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the input format.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the input format correctly and does not process the numbers from 1 to \( n \) as required by the problem statement. It also fails to handle multiple test cases.
