You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Annotated Code: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and returns the sum of its digits. After the function concludes, the integer `n` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the sum of the digits of `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - For example, if \( n = 12 \), the numbers on the board after replacement are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, and their sum is 51.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program initializes a variable `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive), which means it processes the numbers 0 through 12.
   - For each number \( i \) in this range, it calls the function `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of the digits of the number \( n \).

3. **Checking the Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly converts the number \( n \) to a string, iterates over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up.
   - This function works correctly for any non-negative integer \( n \).

4. **Checking the Loop:**
   - The loop `for i in range(13)` iterates from 0 to 12, which is not the same as iterating from 1 to \( n \) as required by the problem statement.
   - The problem specifies that \( n \) ranges from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \), but the loop only goes up to 12.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem because it only processes the numbers from 0 to 12, instead of processing the numbers from 1 to \( n \) for each test case.
   - Additionally, the program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the input format.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the input format correctly and does not process the numbers from 1 to \( n \) as required by the problem statement.
