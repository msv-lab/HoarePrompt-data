You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Annotated Code: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program is designed to calculate the sum of the digit sums for a fixed range (from 1 to 12), whereas the problem requires a function that can handle multiple test cases and different values of `n` up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Fixed Range**: The loop `for i in range(13):` always iterates from 1 to 12, which does not match the requirement to handle different values of `n`.
2. **Single Test Case**: The program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the input format.
3. **Time Complexity**: The provided solution would be inefficient for large values of `n` (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)), especially since it recalculates the sum of digits for each number individually.

To make the program correct, it should:
- Handle multiple test cases.
- Calculate the sum of the digit sums for any given `n` efficiently.

A correct implementation might look like this:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    def digit_sum(x):
        return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))
    
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += digit_sum(i)
    return total_sum

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    results.append(sum_of_digit_sums(n))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation correctly handles multiple test cases and calculates the sum of the digit sums for any given `n`.
