Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not match the problem statement. The problem requires handling multiple test cases and calculating the sum of digit sums for numbers from 1 to n for each test case. However, the given program only calculates the sum of digit sums for numbers from 0 to 12 (inclusive) using a function `func_1` and prints the result. This does not meet the requirements of the problem, which involves reading input for multiple test cases and processing each one individually. Additionally, the program does not handle the constraints specified in the problem, such as the number of test cases and the range of n.
