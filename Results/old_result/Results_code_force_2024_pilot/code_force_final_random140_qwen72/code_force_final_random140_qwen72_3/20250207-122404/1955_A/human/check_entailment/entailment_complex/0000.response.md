Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It iterates over the number of test cases, reads the necessary inputs for each case, and computes the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts using either the regular price or the promotional price. The calculations for `s1` and `s2` are accurate:

- `s1` is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`n * a`).
- `s2` is the total cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price (`b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`).

The program then prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
