Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - `s1` is calculated as `n * a`, which represents the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, which represents the total cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and any remaining yogurt at the regular price.
     - `b * (n // 2)` accounts for the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price.
     - `n % 2 * a` accounts for the cost of any remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.

3. **Minimum Cost Output**: The program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each test case, ensuring that the output is the least amount of burles needed to buy `n` yogurts.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 or 2, and when the promotional price `b` is greater than twice the regular price `a`.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program meets all the requirements and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
