The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally handle or generate test cases where `t` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4], and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within their respective ranges [1, 100] and [1, 30]. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine what exactly it returns based on the given information.

However, if we assume that the function processes these test cases and returns some result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), where each test case involves integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). The function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.**
