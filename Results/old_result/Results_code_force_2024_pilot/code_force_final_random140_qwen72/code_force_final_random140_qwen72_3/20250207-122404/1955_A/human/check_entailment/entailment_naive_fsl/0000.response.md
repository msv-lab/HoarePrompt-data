Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It considers both the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`s1`) and the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price plus the remaining yogurts at the regular price (`s2`). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs. This approach covers all potential cases within the constraints provided in the problem description. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
