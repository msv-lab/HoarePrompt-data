Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a specific integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a specific integer where \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
- `b` is a specific integer where \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
- `s1` is equal to \(n \times a\).
- `s2` is equal to \(b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\).

### Explanation:
1. **Calculate `s1`:**
   - `s1 = n * a`
   - This is simply the product of `n` and `a`.

2. **Calculate `s2`:**
   - `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`
   - Here, `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `n % 2` is the remainder when `n` is divided by 2, which is either 0 (if `n` is even) or 1 (if `n` is odd).
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so the term `n % 2 * a` becomes 0.
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so the term `n % 2 * a` becomes `a`.

   Therefore:
   - If `n` is even, `s2 = b * (n // 2)`.
   - If `n` is odd, `s2 = b * (n // 2) + a`.

3. **Determine the minimum of `s1` and `s2`:**
   - The `min(s1, s2)` function will return the smaller of the two values.

### Final Output:
The `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will print the smaller of the two values `s1` and `s2`.

- `s1` is \(n \times a\).
- `s2` is \(b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\).

Output: **min(n * a, b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a)**

This output provides the precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the formula for `s1` and `s2`.
