Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and the loop has at least one more iteration remaining based on the input value.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s1 = n * a` reassigns the value of `s1` to be `n * a`. Since `s1` was already defined as `n * a` in the initial state, the value of `s1` remains unchanged. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s2`) and conditions (loop having at least one more iteration) remain the same as in the initial state.
