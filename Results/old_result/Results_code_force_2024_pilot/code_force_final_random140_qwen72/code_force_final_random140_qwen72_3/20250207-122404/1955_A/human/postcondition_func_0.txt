The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). It calculates two values: `s1` as `n * a` and `s2` as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. The function then prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
