Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and the loop has at least one more iteration remaining based on the input value.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s1`) remain unchanged.
- The loop condition remains valid, indicating that there is at least one more iteration remaining.
