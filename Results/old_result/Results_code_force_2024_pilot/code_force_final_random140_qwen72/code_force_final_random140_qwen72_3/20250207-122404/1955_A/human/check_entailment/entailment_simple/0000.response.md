Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it calculates two possible costs:

1. `s1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`n * a`).
2. `s2`: The cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price (`b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`).

The program then prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case. This approach ensures that the minimum cost is always found, as it considers both the regular and promotional prices.

The logic and calculations are correct, and the program handles all edge cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
