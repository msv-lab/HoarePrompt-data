#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 3 ≤ num ≤ 78.
def func_1(num):
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `num + 96`. Since `num` is an integer between 3 and 26, the returned letter will be between 'c' and 'z'.
    #State: num is an integer such that 27 ≤ num ≤ 78.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range 3 ≤ num ≤ 78. If `num` is within the range 1 to 26, it returns the corresponding lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' based on the ASCII value of `num + 96`. For values of `num` outside the range 1 to 26, the function does not return anything (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`).
