You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 3 ≤ num ≤ 78.
def func_1(num):
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `num + 96`. Since `num` is an integer between 3 and 26, the returned letter will be between 'c' and 'z'.
    #State: num is an integer such that 27 ≤ num ≤ 78.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range 3 ≤ num ≤ 78. If `num` is within the range 1 to 26, it returns the corresponding lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' based on the ASCII value of `num + 96`. For values of `num` outside the range 1 to 26, the function does not return anything (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program fails to handle certain edge cases and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. Here are a few issues:

1. **Handling of `n` values greater than 52**: The program only handles up to two full cycles of 26 (i.e., `n` values up to 52). For values greater than 52, the program does not correctly distribute the remaining value among the three letters.

2. **Incorrect distribution of values**: The program assumes specific conditions for distributing the values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, these conditions do not cover all possible cases, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Edge cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the value of `n` is close to the maximum possible value (78) or other boundary conditions.

For example, consider the input `n = 78`:
- The correct output should be `zzz` (since 26 + 26 + 26 = 78).
- The provided program will incorrectly output `azz` (since it does not handle values greater than 52 correctly).

Another example, consider the input `n = 53`:
- The correct output should be `azz` (since 1 + 26 + 26 = 53).
- The provided program will incorrectly output `bzz` (since it does not handle the distribution correctly).

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
