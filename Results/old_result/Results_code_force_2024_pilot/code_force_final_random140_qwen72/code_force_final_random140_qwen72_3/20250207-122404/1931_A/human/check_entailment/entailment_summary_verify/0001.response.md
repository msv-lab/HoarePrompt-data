### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose sum of character positions equals a given integer `n`.
   - The sum of the positions of the characters in the word should equal `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of conditions to determine the values of the three characters `a`, `b`, and `c`:
     - If `n // 26 == 0`, it sets `a` and `b` to 'a' and `c` to the character corresponding to `n - 2`.
     - If `n // 26 == 1`, it sets `a` to 'a', `b` to the character corresponding to `n - 27`, and `c` to 'z'.
     - If `n // 26 == 2`, it sets `a` to the character corresponding to `n - 52`, and both `b` and `c` to 'z'.

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The conditions are designed to handle different ranges of `n`:
     - `n // 26 == 0` covers the range `3 <= n <= 26`.
     - `n // 26 == 1` covers the range `27 <= n <= 52`.
     - `n // 26 == 2` covers the range `53 <= n <= 78`.

5. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The program constructs the word by converting the calculated values to characters using `chr(96 + value)`.
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

6. **Testing Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 3`, the program correctly outputs "aaa".
   - For `n = 24`, the program correctly outputs "aav".
   - For `n = 70`, the program correctly outputs "rzz".
   - For `n = 55`, the program correctly outputs "czz".
   - For `n = 48`, the program correctly outputs "auz".

7. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is not used in the main program logic.
   - The function `func_1` converts an integer `num` within the range 1 to 26 to its corresponding lowercase letter. This function is not necessary for the main logic of the program.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the given test cases and produces the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for each `n` within the specified range.
   - The function `func_1` is not utilized in the main logic, but its presence does not affect the correctness of the program.
