Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = ''
    b = ''
    c = ''
    if n // 26 == 0:
        a = chr(96 + 1)
        b = chr(96 + 1)
        c = chr(96 + (n - 2))
    elif n // 26 == 1:
        a = chr(96 + 1)
        b = chr(96 + (n - 27))
        c = chr(96 + 26)
    elif n // 26 == 2:
        a = chr(96 + (n - 52))
        b = chr(96 + 26)
        c = chr(96 + 26)
    print(a + '' + b + '' + c)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 3 ≤ num ≤ 78.
def func_1(num):
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `num + 96`. Since `num` is an integer between 3 and 26, the returned letter will be between 'c' and 'z'.
    #State: num is an integer such that 27 ≤ num ≤ 78.
