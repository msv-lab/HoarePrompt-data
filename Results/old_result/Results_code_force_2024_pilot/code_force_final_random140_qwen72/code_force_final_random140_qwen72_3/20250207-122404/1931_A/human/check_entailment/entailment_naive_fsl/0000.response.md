Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program fails to handle certain edge cases and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. Here are a few issues:

1. **Handling of `n` values greater than 52**: The program only handles up to two full cycles of 26 (i.e., `n` values up to 52). For values greater than 52, the program does not correctly distribute the remaining value among the three letters.

2. **Incorrect distribution of values**: The program assumes specific conditions for distributing the values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, these conditions do not cover all possible cases, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Edge cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the value of `n` is close to the maximum possible value (78) or other boundary conditions.

For example, consider the input `n = 78`:
- The correct output should be `zzz` (since 26 + 26 + 26 = 78).
- The provided program will incorrectly output `azz` (since it does not handle values greater than 52 correctly).

Another example, consider the input `n = 53`:
- The correct output should be `azz` (since 1 + 26 + 26 = 53).
- The provided program will incorrectly output `bzz` (since it does not handle the distribution correctly).

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
