The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `L1[i]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than or equal to `L1[i]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2. The variable `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, so if the last value of `j` was `k`, then the new value of `j` is `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than or equal to `L1[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment in `j` and the condition that `j` must still be less than or equal to `L1[2]` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the last value of `j`, `res` is a list. If `L1[2]` is divisible by `j`, `res` has one additional element equal to `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
