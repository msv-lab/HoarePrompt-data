The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `L1[i]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `L1[i]`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i]`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000,
- `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case,
- `num` is a positive integer greater than 0,
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2,
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is some value between 2 and `L1[i]` (inclusive),
- If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `L1[i]`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least `j + 1`, if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, otherwise, `res` remains an empty list.**
