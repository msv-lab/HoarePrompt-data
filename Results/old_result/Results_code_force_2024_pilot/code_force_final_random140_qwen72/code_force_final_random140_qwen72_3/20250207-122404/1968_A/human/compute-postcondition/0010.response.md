To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(num):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `num` is greater than 0. This is because `range(num)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `num - 1`, and if `num` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0, as the loop will start with `i = 0`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`num`**: Ensure `num` is greater than 0.
- **`i`**: Set `i` to 0.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is `num - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `num` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
