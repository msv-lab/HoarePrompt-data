Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `res` is a list. If `L1[1]` is divisible by 3, `res` now contains three elements: the first element is `L1[0] // 3 * 2`, the second element is `L1[1] // 3 * 2`, and the third element is `L1[1] // 4 * 3`. If `L1[1]` is not divisible by 3, `res` now contains two elements: the first element is `L1[0] // 3 * 2` and the second element is `L1[1] // 4 * 3`.**
