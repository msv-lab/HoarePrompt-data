Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `i` is `num - 1`, `res` is a list. For each integer `L1[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`), if `L1[i]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[i]`], then `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest such `j`. If `L1[i]` is a prime number, `res` remains unchanged from its previous state.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The variable `x` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The variable `num` remains a positive integer, indicating the length of the list `L1`.
- The list `L1` remains unchanged, containing `num` integers.
- The variable `i` is now equal to `num - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The list `res` contains elements based on the conditions inside the loop. For each element `L1[i]` in the list `L1`, if it is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[i]`], the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` is appended to `res` for the smallest such `j`. If `L1[i]` is a prime number, no value is appended to `res` for that iteration.
