To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

- The loop head involves the variables `j` and `L1[i]`.
- For the loop to execute, `L1[i]` must be at least 2 because the loop iterates from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
- `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[0]` greater than 1 if `L1[0]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[0]`], otherwise `res` remains an empty list.

For the loop to execute:
- `L1[i]` must be at least 2.
- `j` must start at 2.

Since `i` is 1, we need to ensure that `L1[1]` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `num`, `L1[0]`, `res`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[0]` greater than 1 if `L1[0]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[0]`], otherwise `res` remains an empty list.**
