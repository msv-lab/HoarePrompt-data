Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `res` is a list. If `L1[2]` is divisible by any integer from 2 to `L1[2]` inclusive, `res` contains exactly one element which is `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[2]` greater than 1. If `L1[2]` is a prime number, `res` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `L1[2] + 1`.
- For each value of `j` in this range, the loop checks if `L1[2]` is divisible by `j`.
- If `L1[2]` is divisible by `j`, it appends the value `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res` and breaks out of the loop.
- This means that `res` will contain at most one element, which is the result of the first successful division.
- If `L1[2]` is a prime number, it will not be divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, so the loop will complete without appending anything to `res`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `res` will either contain one element (if `L1[2]` is not a prime) or remain unchanged (if `L1[2]` is a prime).
