You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    18

- Program:
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter the number of entries, followed by the actual entries. For each entry, it calculates a specific value based on the smallest divisor greater than 1 and appends this value to a result list. The function then prints each value in the result list on a new line. The final state of the program includes the printed values, and the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always produce the correct output for the given problem description. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `y` is flawed. The program divides `L1[i]` by the smallest divisor greater than 1 and then multiplies by `(j - 1)`, which does not necessarily maximize the value of `\gcd(x, y) + y`.

For example, consider the input `x = 10`. According to the problem, we need to find `y` such that `1 <= y < 10` and `\gcd(10, y) + y` is maximized. The correct output for `x = 10` should be `5` because `\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6`, which is the maximum possible value. However, the program outputs `4` because it divides `10` by its smallest divisor `2` and then multiplies by `(2 - 1)`, resulting in `5 // 2 * (2 - 1) = 4`.

This shows that the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
