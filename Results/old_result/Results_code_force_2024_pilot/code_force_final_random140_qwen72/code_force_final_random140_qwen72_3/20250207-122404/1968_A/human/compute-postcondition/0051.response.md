Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the last value of `j`, `res` is a list with one additional element equal to `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the last value of `j`, the new element added to `res` is calculated as `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
