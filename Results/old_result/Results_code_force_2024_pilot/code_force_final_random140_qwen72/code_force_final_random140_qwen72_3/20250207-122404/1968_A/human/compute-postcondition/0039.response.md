Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `res` is a list. For each integer `L1[i]` (where `i` is 1), if `L1[i]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[i]`], then `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest such `j`. If `L1[i]` is not divisible by any integer in the range [2, `L1[i]`], then `res` remains unchanged from its previous state.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- **`x`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 2 to 1000 for each test case.
- **`num`**: Remains a positive integer greater than 0.
- **`L1`**: The list `L1` remains unchanged, with `L1[0]` being at least 2 and `L1[1]` being at least 2.
- **`i`**: Remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`res`**: After the loop completes, `res` will contain the result of the operation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than 1, if such a divisor exists. If no such divisor exists, `res` will remain unchanged from its initial state. This process is repeated for each element in `L1` starting from `L1[1]`.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop for all elements in `L1` starting from `L1[1]`.
