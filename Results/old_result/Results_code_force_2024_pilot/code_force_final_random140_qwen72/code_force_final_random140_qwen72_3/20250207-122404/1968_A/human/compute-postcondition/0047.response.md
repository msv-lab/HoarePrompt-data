Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the last value of `j`, `res` is a list with one additional element equal to `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)`**. 

Explanation: The code appends the result of the expression `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. The values of `t`, `x`, `num`, `L1`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The list `res` now contains one additional element calculated from the given expression.
