The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter the number of entries, followed by the actual entries. For each entry, it calculates a specific value based on the smallest divisor greater than 1 and appends this value to a result list. The function then prints each value in the result list on a new line. The final state of the program includes the printed values, and the function does not return any value.
