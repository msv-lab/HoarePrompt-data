The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `res`. This value is derived from the integer division of `L1[i]` by `j`, multiplied by `(j - 1)`. Given the initial conditions, `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, ensuring that the division results in an integer.

Let's break down the changes:
- `res` was initially an empty list. After the code executes, `res` contains one element, which is the result of the calculation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
- No other variables (`t`, `x`, `num`, `L1`, `i`, `j`) are modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`.**
