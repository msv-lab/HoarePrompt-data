Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least `j + 1`, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` and the second element is the previously appended value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
