Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `res` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` and the second element is `L1[1] // j * (j - 1)`, and `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[0]` and `L1[1]` greater than 1 if both `L1[0]` and `L1[1]` are divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[0]` and `L1[1]`], otherwise `res` contains only the first element and the second element is not appended.**
