The value of `num` is assigned the integer value entered by the user when prompted with 'Enter number of entries- '. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, and `num` is an input integer representing the number of entries.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, and `num` is an input integer representing the number of entries.**
