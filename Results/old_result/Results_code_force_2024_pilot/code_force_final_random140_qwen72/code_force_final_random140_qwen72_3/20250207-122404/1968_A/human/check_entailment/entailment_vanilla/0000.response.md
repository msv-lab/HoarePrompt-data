### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The key observation is that \( y \) should be a divisor of \( x \) to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) \). If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then reads \( t \) integers \( x \) and stores them in a list \( L1 \).
   - For each \( x \) in \( L1 \), it iterates from 2 to \( x \) to find the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \).
   - Once a divisor \( j \) is found, it calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) and appends this value to the result list \( res \).
   - Finally, it prints the results separated by newlines.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \) greater than 1.
   - It then calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \). This ensures that \( y \) is a multiple of \( j - 1 \) and less than \( x \).
   - However, the formula \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) does not necessarily maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Instead, the correct approach would be to set \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) if \( x \) is prime, or to the largest proper divisor of \( x \) otherwise.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( x = 10 \), the largest proper divisor is 5, so \( y = 5 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), the largest proper divisor is 1, so \( y = 6 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), the largest proper divisor is 7, so \( y = 14 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the largest proper divisor is 50, so \( y = 98 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), the largest proper divisor is 1, so \( y = 1 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the largest proper divisor is 500, so \( y = 750 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), the largest proper divisor is 3, so \( y = 3 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
