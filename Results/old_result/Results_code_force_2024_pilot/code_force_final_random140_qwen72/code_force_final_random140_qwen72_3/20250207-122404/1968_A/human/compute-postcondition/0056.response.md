To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res, sep='\n')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each test case.
- `num` is a positive integer.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers.
- `i` is `num - 1`.
- `res` is a list.

### Logic:
- For each integer `L1[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`):
  - If `L1[i]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[i]`], then `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest such `j`.
  - If `L1[i]` is a prime number, `res` remains unchanged from its previous state.

### Explanation:
1. **Prime Numbers**: If `L1[i]` is a prime number, it will not be divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[i]`]. Therefore, no value will be added to `res` for this `L1[i]`.
2. **Non-Prime Numbers**: If `L1[i]` is not a prime number, it will be divisible by some integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[i]`]. The smallest such `j` will be used to compute the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and this value will be added to `res`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `L1 = [10, 15, 7, 21]`.

- For `L1[0] = 10`:
  - Smallest `j` such that 10 % j == 0 is 2.
  - Value to add to `res`: \(10 // 2 * (2 - 1) = 5\).

- For `L1[1] = 15`:
  - Smallest `j` such that 15 % j == 0 is 3.
  - Value to add to `res`: \(15 // 3 * (3 - 1) = 10\).

- For `L1[2] = 7`:
  - 7 is a prime number, so no value is added to `res`.

- For `L1[3] = 21`:
  - Smallest `j` such that 21 % j == 0 is 3.
  - Value to add to `res`: \(21 // 3 * (3 - 1) = 14\).

Thus, `res` will be `[5, 10, 14]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*res, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of `res` on a new line.

Output: **5
10
14**

This output is based on the specific example provided. In general, the output will be the values computed for each non-prime number in `L1` according to the given formula, with each value on a new line. If `L1` contains only prime numbers, `res` will be empty, and nothing will be printed.
