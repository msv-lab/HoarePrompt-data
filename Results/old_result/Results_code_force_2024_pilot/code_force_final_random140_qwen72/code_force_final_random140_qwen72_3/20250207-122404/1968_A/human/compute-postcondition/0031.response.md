The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `L1[i]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than or equal to `L1[i]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was 2 and `L1[i]` (where `i` is 1) is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `L1[i]` must still be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `res` is a list. If `L1[i]` (where `i` is 1) is divisible by `j` (the smallest divisor of `L1[0]` greater than 1), then `res` contains two elements: the first element is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` and the second element is `L1[1] // j * (j - 1)`. If `L1[i]` is not divisible by `j`, then `res` contains only the first element, which is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)`. `j` is 3.**
