You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and x is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `num - 1`.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `i` is `num - 1`, `res` is a list. For each integer `L1[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`), if `L1[i]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[i]`], then `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest such `j`. If `L1[i]` is a prime number, `res` remains unchanged from its previous state.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: 5
    #10
    #14



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The key observation is that \( y \) should be a divisor of \( x \) to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) \). If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then reads \( t \) integers \( x \) and stores them in a list \( L1 \).
   - For each \( x \) in \( L1 \), it iterates from 2 to \( x \) to find the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \).
   - Once a divisor \( j \) is found, it calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) and appends this value to the result list \( res \).
   - Finally, it prints the results separated by newlines.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \) greater than 1.
   - It then calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \). This ensures that \( y \) is a multiple of \( j - 1 \) and less than \( x \).
   - However, the formula \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) does not necessarily maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Instead, the correct approach would be to set \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) if \( x \) is prime, or to the largest proper divisor of \( x \) otherwise.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( x = 10 \), the largest proper divisor is 5, so \( y = 5 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), the largest proper divisor is 1, so \( y = 6 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), the largest proper divisor is 7, so \( y = 14 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the largest proper divisor is 50, so \( y = 98 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), the largest proper divisor is 1, so \( y = 1 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the largest proper divisor is 500, so \( y = 750 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), the largest proper divisor is 3, so \( y = 3 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
