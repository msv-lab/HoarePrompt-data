The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `num` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `num` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[0]` greater than 1 if `L1[0]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[0]`], otherwise `res` remains an empty list.**
