The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters: `t` and `x`. Here, `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` is a positive integer within the range 2 to 1000. The function's output is not specified, but typically, such functions would perform some operation using these parameters and return a result.

Since the specific output is not detailed, I will assume that the function performs some unspecified operation and returns a result based on the input parameters `t` and `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `x`, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000) and `x` is a positive integer (2 <= x <= 1000). It performs an unspecified operation using these parameters and returns a result.**
