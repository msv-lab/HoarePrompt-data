The value of `i` (which is 0) is added to the list `p`. The other variables (`a`, `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `a` must be at least 2, `t` is a positive integer representing the total number of test cases, `p` is now `[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` must be at least 2, `t` is a positive integer representing the total number of test cases, `p` is now `[0]`.**
