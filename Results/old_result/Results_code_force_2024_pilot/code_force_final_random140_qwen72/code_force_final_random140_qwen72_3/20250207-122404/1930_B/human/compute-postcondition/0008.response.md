The value of `i` is 4, and the list `p` initially contains `[0, 2]`. The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Therefore, the updated list `p` is `[0, 2, 4]`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `a` must be at least 4, `t` is a positive integer representing the total number of test cases, `p` is `[0, 2, 4]`**
