You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = []
        for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
            p += [i]
        for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
            p += [i]
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the permutation to be generated. The total number of test cases, t, is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = []
        
        for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
            p += [i]
        
        for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
            p += [i]
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains unchanged for each test case, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (if `a` is even) or `a - 1` (if `a` is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a` (if `a` is odd) or `a - 1` (if `a` is even). The variable `i` is no longer relevant after the loop completes, and `t` remains unchanged, representing the total number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and generates a permutation of length `n`. The permutation starts with all even numbers from 2 up to and including `n` (or `n-1` if `n` is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `n` (or `n-1` if `n` is even). The function prints the permutation for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the permutations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program constructs the permutation by placing all even numbers first, followed by all odd numbers. This approach can lead to invalid permutations in certain cases.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
```

**Expected Output:**
A valid permutation such as `4 1 2 3` or `3 4 2 1`.

**Actual Output:**
```
2 4 1 3
```

In the actual output, `2 4 1 3`, we can see that:
- `p_1 = 2` divides `p_3 = 1` (since 1 is divisible by any non-zero integer).
- `p_2 = 4` divides `p_4 = 3` (since 3 is not divisible by 4).

However, the problem states that there should not exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). In this case, the condition is violated because \(p_1\) divides \(p_3\) and \(p_2\) does not divide \(p_4\), but the structure of the permutation still fails to meet the requirement in other cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
