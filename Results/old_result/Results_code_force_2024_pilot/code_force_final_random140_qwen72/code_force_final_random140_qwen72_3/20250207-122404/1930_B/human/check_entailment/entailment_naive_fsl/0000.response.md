Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program constructs the permutation by placing all even numbers first, followed by all odd numbers. This approach can lead to invalid permutations in certain cases.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
```

**Expected Output:**
A valid permutation such as `4 1 2 3` or `3 4 2 1`.

**Actual Output:**
```
2 4 1 3
```

In the actual output, `2 4 1 3`, we can see that:
- `p_1 = 2` divides `p_3 = 1` (since 1 is divisible by any non-zero integer).
- `p_2 = 4` divides `p_4 = 3` (since 3 is not divisible by 4).

However, the problem states that there should not exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). In this case, the condition is violated because \(p_1\) divides \(p_3\) and \(p_2\) does not divide \(p_4\), but the structure of the permutation still fails to meet the requirement in other cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
