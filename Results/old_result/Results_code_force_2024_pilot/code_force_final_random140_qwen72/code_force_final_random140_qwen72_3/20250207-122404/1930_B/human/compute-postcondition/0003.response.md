To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `a`, and the range parameters (2, `a + 1`, 2).

2. **Range Function**: The `range(2, a + 1, 2)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `a + 1`, with a step of 2. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one element.

3. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if there is at least one number in the range. This means that the starting value (2) must be less than or equal to the ending value (`a + 1 - 2`), which simplifies to `2 <= a`.

4. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0 (but this will be reset by the loop).
   - `a` is the first integer from the input.
   - `t` is a positive integer representing the total number of test cases.
   - `p` is an empty list.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `i` will be set by the loop, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `a` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `t` and `p` are not involved in the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be at least 2. The other variables remain as they are.

State: **`i` is 0, `a` must be at least 2, `t` is a positive integer representing the total number of test cases, `p` is an empty list**
