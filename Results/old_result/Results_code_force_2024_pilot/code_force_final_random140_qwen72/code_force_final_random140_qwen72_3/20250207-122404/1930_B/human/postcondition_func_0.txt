The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and generates a permutation of length `n`. The permutation starts with all even numbers from 2 up to and including `n` (or `n-1` if `n` is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `n` (or `n-1` if `n` is even). The function prints the permutation for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the permutations.
