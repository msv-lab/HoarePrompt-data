Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` representing the k-th element query index, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array after all operations. It returns the value of the element at index `x` in the list `b` under different conditions:**

- **Case_1:** If `x` is directly an element in the list `b`, the function returns the value of the element at index `x`.
- **Case_2:** If `x` is not directly in `b`, the function calculates a new index as `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the first element of list `a`, and returns the element at this new index in `b`.
- **Case_3:** If `x` is not directly in `b` and the previous condition did not apply, the function calculates a new index as `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the second element of list `a`, and returns the element at this new index in `b`.
- **Case_4:** If none of the above conditions are met, the function calculates a new index as `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the third element of list `a`, and returns the element at this new index in `b`.
