Output State: **x is an integer representing the k-th element query index, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array after all operations.** 

Explanation: The code `x = int(x)` converts `x` to an integer, but since `x` was already specified as an integer in the initial state, this operation does not change its value or type. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
