### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes necessary variables.
   - It reads the number of operations (`c`) and queries (`d`) for each test case.

2. **Operation Handling:**
   - The program processes each operation:
     - For type 1 operations, it appends the integer `e` to the end of the array `a`.
     - For type 2 operations, it appends `e` copies of the current array `a` to itself.
   - The use of a dictionary `b` to store the values of the array at specific indices is appropriate for efficient lookups.

3. **Array Size Management:**
   - The program ensures that the size of the array does not exceed \(10^{19}\), which is a reasonable constraint given the problem's constraints.
   - The array `a` is reversed at the end of the operations, which is necessary for the subsequent query handling.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle the queries efficiently:
     - It checks if the query index `x` is directly in the dictionary `b` and returns the corresponding value if found.
     - If not, it iterates through the reversed array `a` to find the correct value using modulo arithmetic to handle large indices efficiently.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results of the queries in the required format.

### Issues:
- **Variable Naming and Overwriting:**
  - The variable `d` is used both for the number of queries and for the type of operation, which can lead to confusion.
  - The variable `a` is used both for the array and as a reversed version of the array, which can also lead to confusion.

- **Function Call:**
  - The function `r` is called in the print statement, but it is not defined in the provided code. It should be `func_1`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = [0]
    b = {}
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        (op, x) = map(int, input().split())
        if a[-1] > 10 ** 19:
            continue
        if op == 1:
            a[-1] += 1
            b[a[-1]] = x
        else:
            a.append(a[-1] * (x + 1))
    a = a[::-1]

    def func_1(x):
        x = int(x)
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        for i in a:
            x = (x - 1) % i + 1
            if x in b:
                return b[x]
        return None

    print(' '.join(map(str, [func_1(x) for x in input().split()])))
```
