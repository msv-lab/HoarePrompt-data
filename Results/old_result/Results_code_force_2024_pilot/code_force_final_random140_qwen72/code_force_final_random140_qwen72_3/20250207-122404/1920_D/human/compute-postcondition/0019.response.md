Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` representing the k-th element query index, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array after all operations. It returns the value of the element at index `x` in the list `b` if `x` is an element in `b`. If `x` is not in `b`, the function iterates over each element `i` in list `a`, updating `x` to `(x - 1) % i + 1` for each `i`. During this iteration, if `x` becomes an element in `b`, the function returns the value of `b` at the updated index `x`. If no such `x` is found in `b` after iterating through all elements in `a`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns `None`). **
