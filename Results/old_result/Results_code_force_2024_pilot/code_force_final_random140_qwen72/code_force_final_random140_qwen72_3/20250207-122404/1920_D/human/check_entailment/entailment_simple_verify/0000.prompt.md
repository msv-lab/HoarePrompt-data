You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

Otherwise, the loop completes without returning, and `b` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Variable Naming Conflicts**: The variable `d` is used both for the number of queries and as part of the loop for reading operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior and conflicts.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Operation Type 1**: The logic for appending an integer to the array is incorrect. The program uses `a[-1] += 1` and `b[a[-1]] = e`, which does not correctly append the integer to the array. Instead, it should simply append the integer to the array.

3. **Handling Large Arrays**: The program attempts to handle large arrays by using a dictionary `b` and a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array. However, the logic for updating and querying the array is flawed. Specifically, the way it handles the modulo operation and the dictionary lookups is not correct.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to handle the queries, but it is not defined in the provided code. The placeholder `r` is used in the `print` statement, which is not defined anywhere in the code.

5. **Incorrect Output Format**: The output format in the `print` statement is incorrect. It uses `str(list(map(r, input().split())))[1:-1].replace(',', '')`, which is not a valid way to format the output as required by the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
