You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: x is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array a, which is constructed through a series of operations described in the problem statement.
```
def func_1(x):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns the value of the element at index `x` in the array `b`.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `b` at the index which is the element at position `2 * i + 1` in the array `a`. Here, `i` is `f - 1`, and the element at index `2 * i + 1` in `a` is less than the original `x`.

Case_3: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final value of `i` is `-1`. The value of `f` remains unchanged. The value of `x` is the result of the operations performed within the loop, which may have been updated based on the conditions specified. If the loop did not return a value before completing all iterations, the final value of `x` will be used to return `b[x]`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
