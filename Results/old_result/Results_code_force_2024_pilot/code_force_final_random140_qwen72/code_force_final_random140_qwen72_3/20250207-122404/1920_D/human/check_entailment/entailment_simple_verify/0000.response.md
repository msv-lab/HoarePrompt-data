Reasoning:

1. **Variable Naming Conflicts**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the variable `d` is reused, which can lead to conflicts. However, in the context of the provided code, `d` is only used within the scope of the inner loop and does not conflict with the outer `d` (number of queries). This issue is minor and does not significantly impact the overall logic.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Operation Type 1**: The original assessment states that the logic for appending an integer to the array is incorrect. However, the program uses a dictionary `b` to map the position to the value, which is a valid approach for handling the array without explicitly constructing it due to potential size constraints. The line `a[-1] += 1` increments the size of the array, and `b[a[-1]] = e` correctly maps the new size to the value being appended. This logic is actually correct for the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling Large Arrays**: The program uses a clever approach to handle large arrays by maintaining a list `a` that keeps track of the sizes of the array at different stages and a dictionary `b` that maps positions to values. The logic for updating `a` and `b` is correct and efficiently handles the large size constraints.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The original assessment points out that `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, and the placeholder `r` is used in the `print` statement. This is indeed a significant issue. The function `func_1` is crucial for handling the queries, and its absence makes the program incomplete and incorrect.

5. **Incorrect Output Format**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the output format in the `print` statement is incorrect. The use of `str(list(map(r, input().split())))[1:-1].replace(',', '')` is not a valid way to format the output as required by the problem description. The correct format should be a space-separated list of integers.

Given these points, the primary issues are the undefined function `func_1` and the incorrect output format. These issues render the program incorrect.

Final: **False**
