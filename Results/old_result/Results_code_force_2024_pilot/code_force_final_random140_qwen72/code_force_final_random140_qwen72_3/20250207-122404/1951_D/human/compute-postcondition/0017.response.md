Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If `n` < `k`, no changes are made. If `n` ≥ `k`, then if `n` = `k`, no further changes are made. If `n` > `k`, then if `2k < n + 2`, the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` holds true. Otherwise, `(k - 1) ≥ (n - k + 1)`.***
