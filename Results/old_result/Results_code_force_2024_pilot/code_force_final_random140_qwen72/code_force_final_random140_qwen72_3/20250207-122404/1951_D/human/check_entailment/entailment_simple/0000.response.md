### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n < k`. If this condition is true, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins. This is a valid check and the output is correct.

3. **Exact Match**: If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, as she will spend all her coins on the first stall. This is also a valid solution.

4. **General Case**: If `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
   - She will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall, spending `n - k + 1` coins.
   - She will buy 1 jewel from the second stall, spending 1 coin.
   - This totals to `k` jewels and `n` coins spent.

5. **Remaining Case**: If none of the above conditions hold, the program prints "NO". This is the case when `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`, which means it is impossible to set up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels if possible and prints "NO" if it is not possible. The logic and conditions used are correct and cover all possible scenarios.

### Correctness:
**True**
