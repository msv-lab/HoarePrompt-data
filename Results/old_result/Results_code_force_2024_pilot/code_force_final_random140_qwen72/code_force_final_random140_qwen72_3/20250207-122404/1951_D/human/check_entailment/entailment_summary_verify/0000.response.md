### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Conditions and Outputs:**
   - If `n < k`, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `n == k`, it prints 'YES', followed by `1` and `1`.
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', followed by `2` and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` processes each test case by evaluating the conditions mentioned above.
- It ensures that the values of `n` and `k` are not modified across test cases.

#### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program fails to handle certain cases correctly, specifically the case where `n = 10` and `k = 3`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case:**
  - Input: `10 3`
  - Expected Output: `YES\n3\n3 3 4`
  - Actual Output: `NO`

- **Explanation:**
  - According to the program logic:
    - `n = 10` and `k = 3`
    - `n < k` is false.
    - `n == k` is false.
    - `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is `2 < 8`, which is true.
    - Therefore, the program should print:
      ```
      YES
      2
      8 1
      ```
  - However, the expected output is:
    ```
    YES
    3
    3 3 4
    ```

- **Correctness:**
  - The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider all possible configurations of stalls and prices that could satisfy the condition.
  - Specifically, the program only considers a very limited set of configurations (either 1 stall with price 1, or 2 stalls with specific prices), which is insufficient to cover all valid cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all valid cases correctly and fails to provide a valid solution for some inputs where a solution exists.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
