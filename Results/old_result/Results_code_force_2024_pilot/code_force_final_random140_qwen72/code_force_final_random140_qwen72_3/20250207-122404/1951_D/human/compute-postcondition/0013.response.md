Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`. The condition (k - 1 < n - k + 1) is false, which means (k - 1) is greater than or equal to (n - k + 1).***
