Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` holds true, which simplifies to `2k - 1 < n + 1` or `2k < n + 2`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself, but they ensure that the statement is executed under the given constraints.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
