Based on the initial state provided, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers with the constraint that `0 <= a, b, c, d < n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', a, b, c, d)
```

This statement will print a question mark followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we can only describe them based on the given constraints. Each of these variables is a non-negative integer less than `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)**
