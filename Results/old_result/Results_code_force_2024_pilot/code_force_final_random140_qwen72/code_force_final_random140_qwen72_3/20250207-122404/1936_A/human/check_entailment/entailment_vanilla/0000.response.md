### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\), which is the length of the permutation.

3. **Finding the First Index \(ans1\):**
   - The program initializes \(ans1\) to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses the function `func_1` to compare \(p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - If the result is '<', it updates \(ans1\) to \(i\).
   - This step ensures that \(ans1\) is the index of the element with the highest value when ORed with itself.

4. **Finding the Second Index \(mx\):**
   - The program initializes \(mx\) to 0 and creates a list \(v\) containing 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare \(p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\).
   - If the result is '<', it updates \(mx\) to \(i\) and resets \(v\) to contain only \(i\).
   - If the result is '=', it appends \(i\) to \(v\).
   - This step ensures that \(v\) contains all indices that have the same OR result with \(ans1\) as \(mx\).

5. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes \(ans\) to the first element in \(v\).
   - It iterates through the elements in \(v\) and uses `func_1` to compare \(p_{ans} \mid p_{ans}\) with \(p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]}\).
   - If the result is '>', it updates \(ans\) to \(v[i]\).
   - This step ensures that \(ans\) is the index of the element that, when ORed with itself, gives the highest value among the candidates in \(v\).

6. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the indices \(ans\) and \(ans1\) as the final answer.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the index \(ans1\) with the highest value when ORed with itself.
- It then finds all indices that have the same OR result with \(ans1\) as the current maximum.
- Finally, it selects the index among these candidates that, when ORed with itself, gives the highest value.
- However, the final step of selecting the maximum XOR pair is not directly addressed. The program should ensure that the final pair \((ans, ans1)\) indeed maximizes \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is mostly correct, but it does not explicitly verify that the final pair \((ans, ans1)\) maximizes the XOR. Therefore, the correctness of the program is not guaranteed.

**Correctness: False**
