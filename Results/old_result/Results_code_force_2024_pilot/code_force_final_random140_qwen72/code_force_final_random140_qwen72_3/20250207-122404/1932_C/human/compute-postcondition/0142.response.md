Output State: **After all iterations, `l` will be equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`, and `r` will be equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `arr`, and `p` remain unchanged. `ans` is now a list containing the final values of `p` after each iteration, with the last element being the final value of `p` after processing all characters in `s` in reverse order.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` in reverse order.
- For each character, if it is 'R', `r` is incremented, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`.
- If the character is 'L', `l` is decremented, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
- The updated value of `p` is appended to the list `ans` after each iteration.
- After all iterations, `l` will reflect the number of 'L' characters in `s`, and `r` will reflect `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`.
- The list `ans` will contain the values of `p` after each iteration, with the final value of `p` being the last element in the list.
