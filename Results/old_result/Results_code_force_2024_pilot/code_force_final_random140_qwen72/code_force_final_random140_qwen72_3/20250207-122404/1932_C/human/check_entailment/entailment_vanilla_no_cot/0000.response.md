Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it processes the commands and calculates the product. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the product `p` is updated and the indices `l` and `r` are manipulated. The program incorrectly updates the product and indices in the reverse direction, which leads to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize the product of all elements
        p = 1
        for num in arr:
            p = (p * num) % m
        
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        ans = []
        
        for k in s:
            ans.append(p)
            if k == 'L':
                p = (p * pow(arr[l], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
                l += 1
            else:
                p = (p * pow(arr[r], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
                r -= 1
        
        print(*ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initialization**: The product `p` is initialized to the product of all elements in the array modulo `m`.
2. **Processing Commands**: For each command in the string `s`:
   - Append the current product `p` to the result list `ans`.
   - If the command is 'L', update the product `p` by removing the leftmost element using modular inverse.
   - If the command is 'R', update the product `p` by removing the rightmost element using modular inverse.
3. **Modular Inverse**: The modular inverse of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` is calculated using `pow(arr[l], m-2, m)` based on Fermat's Little Theorem, which works because `m` is a prime number (or can be adapted for non-prime `m` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm).

This corrected version ensures that the product is correctly updated and the indices are properly managed, leading to the correct output for each command.
