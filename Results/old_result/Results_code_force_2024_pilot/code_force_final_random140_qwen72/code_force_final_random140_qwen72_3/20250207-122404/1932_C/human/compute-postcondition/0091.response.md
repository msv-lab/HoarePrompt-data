The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. The value of `p` before this operation was either `(arr[l] % m) * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', or `(arr[l] % m) * (arr[l] % m) % m` if `strr` is 'L'. The value of `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1 if `strr` is 'L', and it has already been decreased by 1. The value of `r` is `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'L'. The value of `arr[l]` is an element from the list `arr` at index `l`.

Therefore, the new value of `p` is calculated as follows:
- If `strr` is 'R': `p = ((arr[l] % m) * arr[r] % m) * arr[l] % m`
- If `strr` is 'L': `p = ((arr[l] % m) * (arr[l] % m) % m) * arr[l] % m`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is now `((arr[l] % m) * arr[r] % m) * arr[l] % m` if `strr` is 'R', or `((arr[l] % m) * (arr[l] % m) % m) * arr[l] % m` if `strr` is 'L', `ans` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `p`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1 if `strr` is 'L', and `l` is decreased by 1, `r` is `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'L', `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`.**
