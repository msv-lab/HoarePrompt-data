Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is `arr[l] % m`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `p`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `strr` is the last character of `s`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`. If `strr` is 'L', then `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is either `(arr[l] % m) * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', or `(arr[l] % m) * (arr[l] % m) % m` if `strr` is 'L'. `ans` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `p`. `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1 if `strr` is 'L'. `r` is `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'L'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is updated based on the value of `strr`: if `strr` is 'R', `p` is `p * arr[r] % m`; if `strr` is 'L', `p` is `((arr[l] % m) * (arr[l] % m) % m) * arr[l] % m`. `ans` is a list containing three elements, the first two of which are the previously updated `p`, and the third element is the current `p`. `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1 if `strr` is 'L', and `l` is decreased by 1 if `strr` is 'L'. `r` is `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'L'. `strr` remains the second-to-last character of `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
