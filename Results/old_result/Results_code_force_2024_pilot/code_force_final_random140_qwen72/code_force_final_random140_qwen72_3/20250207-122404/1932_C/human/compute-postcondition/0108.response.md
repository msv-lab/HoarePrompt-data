The only object in the loop head is the variable `k` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `k` is set to the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still be a non-empty string, and `k` should now be set to the next character in the string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, and `k` is set to the second character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.**
