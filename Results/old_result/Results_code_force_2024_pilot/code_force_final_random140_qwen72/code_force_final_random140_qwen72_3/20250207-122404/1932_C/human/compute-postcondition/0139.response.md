Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `p` and the second element is the updated value of `p`, `l` is decreased by 1, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
- The initial state specifies that `l` is decreased by 1, so `l` remains decreased by 1.
- All other variables (`s`, `strr`, `ans`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `p` is now `p * arr[l] % m`, which is the new value stored in `p`.
