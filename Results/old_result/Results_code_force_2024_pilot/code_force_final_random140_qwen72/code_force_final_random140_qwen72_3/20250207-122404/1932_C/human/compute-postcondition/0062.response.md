The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `r` was `n - 2` if the next `k` is 'R', or `n - 1` if the next `k` is 'L'. After the decrement, `r` will be `n - 3` if the next `k` is 'R', or `n - 2` if the next `k` is 'L'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final product of the elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `k` is the next character in `s`, if the next `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`, if the next `k` is 'R', then `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`.**
