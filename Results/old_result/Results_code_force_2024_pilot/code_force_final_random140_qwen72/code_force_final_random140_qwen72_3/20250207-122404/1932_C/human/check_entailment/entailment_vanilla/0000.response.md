### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the string `s`.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the current left and right boundaries of the array. It also initializes `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`.

3. **First Loop**: The first loop iterates over the string `s` to adjust the pointers `l` and `r` based on the commands. If the command is 'L', it increments `l` to remove the leftmost element. If the command is 'R', it decrements `r` to remove the rightmost element. This loop does not calculate the product yet; it only sets up the boundaries.

4. **Second Loop**: The second loop iterates over the string `s` in reverse order. This is necessary because the product needs to be updated based on the elements that are being removed from the array. For each command:
   - If the command is 'R', it increments `r` and multiplies `p` by the element at the new `r` position, taking the result modulo `m`.
   - If the command is 'L', it decrements `l` and multiplies `p` by the element at the new `l` position, taking the result modulo `m`.
   - The result `p` is appended to the `ans` list.

5. **Output**: After processing all commands, the function prints the results in the correct order by reversing the `ans` list and printing its contents.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the commands and calculates the required remainders. The logic and steps are sound and align with the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
