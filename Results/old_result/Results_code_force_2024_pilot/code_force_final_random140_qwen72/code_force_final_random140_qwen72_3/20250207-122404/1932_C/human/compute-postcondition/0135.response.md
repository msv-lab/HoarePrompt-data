The only object in the loop head is the variable `strr` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates over the characters of the string `s` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `strr` was the second-to-last character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `strr` must now be the last character of `s`. Since the loop is iterating in reverse, the next character to be processed is the last character of the original string `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `p` and the second element is the updated value of `p`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**
