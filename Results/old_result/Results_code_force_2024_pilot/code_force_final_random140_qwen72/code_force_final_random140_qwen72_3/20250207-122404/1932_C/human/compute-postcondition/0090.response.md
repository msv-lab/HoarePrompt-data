The value of `l` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is either `(arr[l] % m) * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', or `(arr[l] % m) * (arr[l] % m) % m` if `strr` is 'L', `ans` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `p`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1 if `strr` is 'L', `l` is decreased by 1, `r` is `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'R', or `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` if `strr` is 'L', `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`.**
