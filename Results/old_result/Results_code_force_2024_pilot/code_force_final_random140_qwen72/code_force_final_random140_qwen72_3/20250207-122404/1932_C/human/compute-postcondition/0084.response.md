Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is `(arr[l] % m) * (arr[l] % m) % m`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `p`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`. If `strr` is 'L', then `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to be `(arr[l] % m) * (arr[l] % m) % m`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `arr`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, `strr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
