The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the initial value of `l`. Therefore, we can only state that `l` is incremented by 1, without knowing its exact new value.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is set to the first character of `s` and the current value of `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1.**
