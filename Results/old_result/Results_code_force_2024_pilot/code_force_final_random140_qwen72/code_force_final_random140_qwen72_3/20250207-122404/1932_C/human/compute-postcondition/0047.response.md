To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `p` is the final product of the elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`.
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans[::-1])
```

### Explanation:
- `ans` is a list that contains the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.
- The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the list `ans` and prints its elements in reverse order (`[::-1]`).

### What is Printed:
- The `print` statement will output the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order.
- Each element in `ans` represents the value of `p` after each iteration of the loop, where `p` is the product of elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[p values in reverse order] (where each p value is the product of elements from arr based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in s modulo m after each iteration of the loop)**

This means the output will be a sequence of numbers, each representing the value of `p` after each iteration, but in reverse order. The exact numerical values depend on the specific inputs and the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.
