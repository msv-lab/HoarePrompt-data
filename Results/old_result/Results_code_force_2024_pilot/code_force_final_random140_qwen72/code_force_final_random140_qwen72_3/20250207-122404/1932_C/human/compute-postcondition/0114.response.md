The value of `r` is decreased by 1. The values of `s` and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `r` was already decreased by 1 before this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the third character of `s`, if `k` is 'L' then `l` is incremented by 1, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the third character of `s`, if `k` is 'L' then `l` is incremented by 1, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1.**
