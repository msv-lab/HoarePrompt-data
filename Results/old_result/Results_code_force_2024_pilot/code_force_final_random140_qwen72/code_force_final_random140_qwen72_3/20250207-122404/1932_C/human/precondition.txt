t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, representing the length of the array a and the modulus value, respectively. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, each in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. The string s is of length n and consists only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
