Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' provided by user input, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `s` must have at least one character, and the first character of `s` is 'R'.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, changing from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
