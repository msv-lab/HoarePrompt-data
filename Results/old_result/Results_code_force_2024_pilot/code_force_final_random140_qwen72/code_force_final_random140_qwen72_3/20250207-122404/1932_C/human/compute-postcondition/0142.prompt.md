Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations, `l` will be equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`, and `r` will be equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `arr`, and `p` remain unchanged. `ans` is now an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `p`, and the values of `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `p` and the second element is the updated value of `p`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `ans` is a list containing three elements where the first element is `p`, the second element is the updated value of `p`, and the third element is the new value of `p` after appending. `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
