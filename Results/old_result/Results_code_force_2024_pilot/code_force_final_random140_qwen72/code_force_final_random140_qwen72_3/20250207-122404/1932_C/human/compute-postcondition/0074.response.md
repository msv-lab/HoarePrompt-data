The value of `p` is updated by multiplying its current value (which is 1) by the value at index `r` in the list `arr`, and then taking the result modulo `m`. The value of `r` is calculated as `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`. Since the last character of `s` is 'R', `r` is effectively the number of 'L' characters in `s`, which is `l`.

Therefore, the new value of `p` is `arr[l] % m`.

Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is `arr[l] % m`, `ans` is an empty list, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `strr` is the last character of `s`, and the last character of `s` (`strr`) is 'R'.**
