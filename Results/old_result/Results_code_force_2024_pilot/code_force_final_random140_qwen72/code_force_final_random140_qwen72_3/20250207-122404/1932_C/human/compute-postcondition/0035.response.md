The value of `l` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' provided by user input, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `p` is either `arr[r] % m` if the last character of `s` (`strr`) is 'R', or `arr[l] % m` if the last character of `s` (`strr`) is 'L', `ans` is a list containing the value of `p`, `s` must have at least two characters, and `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`.**
