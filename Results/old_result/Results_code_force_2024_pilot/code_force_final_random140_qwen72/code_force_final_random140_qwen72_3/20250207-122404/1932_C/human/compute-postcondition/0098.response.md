The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is `t`
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input (this will be updated)
- `p` is the final value of `p` after all iterations, which is the product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions determined by the 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, modulo `m`
- `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration
- `l` is -1
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an integer provided by user input
- `m` is an integer provided by user input

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is now a list of integers provided by the user input.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final value of `p` after all iterations, which is the product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions determined by the 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, modulo `m`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration, `l` is -1, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer provided by user input, `m` is an integer provided by user input.**
