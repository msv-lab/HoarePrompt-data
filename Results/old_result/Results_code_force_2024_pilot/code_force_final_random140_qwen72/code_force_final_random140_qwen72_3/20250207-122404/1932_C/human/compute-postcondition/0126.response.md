Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, and the values of `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.***
