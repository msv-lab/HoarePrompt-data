To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans[::-1])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`.
- `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`.
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `arr`, and `p` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` after each iteration, with the last element being the final value of `p` after processing all characters in `s` in reverse order.

### Explanation:
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list `ans[::-1]`, which means it reverses the list `ans` and then prints each element separated by a space.
- The list `ans` contains the values of `p` after each iteration, and the final value of `p` is the last element of this list.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Reversing the List**: `ans[::-1]` reverses the list `ans`.
2. **Unpacking and Printing**: The `*` operator unpacks the reversed list, and the `print` function prints each element separated by a space.

### Final Output:
The output will be the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

### Example:
Suppose `ans` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
- Reversing `ans` gives `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Unpacking and printing this list will result in: `5 4 3 2 1`.

### General Case:
Since the exact values of `ans` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `ans` in reverse order.

Output: **[elements of ans in reverse order, separated by spaces]**
