### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` as integers, `a` as a list of `n` integers, and `s` as a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes the variables `l` and `r` to represent the left and right indices of the array, respectively. Initially, `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `n - 1`.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - The function iterates over the command string `s` to adjust the indices `l` and `r` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - If the command is 'L', `l` is incremented.
   - If the command is 'R', `r` is decremented.
   - This step is necessary to keep track of which elements will be removed in the subsequent steps.

4. **Product Calculation**:
   - The function then iterates over the command string `s` in reverse order to calculate the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`.
   - For each command, it updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the appropriate element from the array and taking the result modulo `m`.
   - The results are stored in the list `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results in the correct order by reversing the `ans` list before printing.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Index Adjustment**:
  - The initial loop that adjusts `l` and `r` ensures that the indices correctly reflect the elements that will remain in the array after each command is processed.
  - This is crucial for the subsequent product calculation.

- **Product Calculation**:
  - The product is calculated in reverse order to ensure that the correct elements are included in the product at each step.
  - The use of modulo `m` ensures that the product does not overflow and remains within the required bounds.

- **Output Order**:
  - The final result is printed in the correct order by reversing the `ans` list, which was built in reverse during the product calculation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the commands and calculates the required products modulo `m` for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound and meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
