Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' provided by user input, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `s` must have at least two characters, `k` is the second character in `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`. If `k` is 'R', `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`.**
