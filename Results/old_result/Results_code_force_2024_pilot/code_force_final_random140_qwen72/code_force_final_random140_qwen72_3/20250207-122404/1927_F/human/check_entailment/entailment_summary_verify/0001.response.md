### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to read input from standard input. These functions are correctly defined and handle different types of input (integers, lists, etc.). The functions `func_2` and `func_5` are not used in the program, so they can be ignored.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The function `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, constructs the graph using adjacency lists, and stores the edges in a list with their weights.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is a key part of the algorithm to find the lightest edge in a cycle. This is correct because we want to find the lightest edge in a cycle, and sorting in descending order allows us to stop early when we find the first cycle.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (or Union-Find) data structure is used to keep track of connected components. This is crucial for detecting cycles.
   - The DSU is initialized with `n + 1` elements to handle 1-based indexing, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The algorithm iterates over the sorted edges. For each edge, it checks if the two endpoints are already in the same component (using `dsu.find`). If they are, it means adding this edge would form a cycle.
   - The first such edge found is the lightest edge in a cycle, and its endpoints are stored as `start` and `end`.
   - This approach is correct because it ensures that the first cycle detected will have the lightest edge among all possible cycles.

5. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - A breadth-first search (BFS) is performed starting from `start` to find the path to `end`. The BFS uses a queue and a dictionary `prev` to keep track of the previous node in the path.
   - Once the path is found, it is printed in reverse order.
   - The BFS is correctly implemented to ensure that the path is reconstructed correctly.

6. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_6` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and constructs the graph.
- The use of DSU ensures that cycles are detected efficiently.
- The BFS correctly reconstructs the path of the cycle.
- The program outputs the required results for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Final: True**
