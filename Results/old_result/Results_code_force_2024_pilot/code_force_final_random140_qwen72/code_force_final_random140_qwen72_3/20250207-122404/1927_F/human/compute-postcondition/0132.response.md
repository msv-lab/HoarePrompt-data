To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `curr != -1`.

From the given state:
- `curr` is set to `end`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `curr` must not be equal to `-1`. Since `curr` is set to `end`, the loop will execute as long as `end` is not `-1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the state, as the condition `curr != -1` will be satisfied if `end` is not `-1`.

State: **After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed node from `que` or `end` if it was reached, and `que` will be empty. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were reachable from `start` and not previously in `prev`, mapping each node to its predecessor in the path. If `end` was reached, the loop will have terminated early when `node` became `end`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `path` is an empty list. `curr` is set to `end`, and `end` must not be `-1`.**
