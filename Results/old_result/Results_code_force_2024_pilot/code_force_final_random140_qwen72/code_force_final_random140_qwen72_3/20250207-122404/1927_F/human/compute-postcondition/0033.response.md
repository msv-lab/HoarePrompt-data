Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`). `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 1`, and `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`. `(w, u, v)` is the first tuple in `edges`. `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, and `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `u` and `v` are now in the same set according to the `dsu` union operation, and `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` remains -1, and `end` remains -1.***
