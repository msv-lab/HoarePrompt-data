Output State: **After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed node from `que` or `end` if it was reached, and `que` will be empty. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were reachable from `start` and not previously in `prev`, mapping each node to its predecessor in the path. If `end` was reached, the loop will have terminated early when `node` became `end`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `path` is now a list containing the full path from `end` back to `start` (or the first node in the path that has no predecessor), with each element being a node in the path. `curr` is set to `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed and no more predecessors can be found.**
