Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`node` is the value of `start`, `que` is a deque containing no elements, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is 0, `dsu` instance reflects the final connected components formed by the union operations, `_min_edge` is the smallest weight `w` of an edge connecting two vertices `u` and `v` in the same component or remains infinity, `start` is a valid vertex (not -1), `end` is -1 if no such edge was found, and `prev` is a dictionary with the key `start` and the value `-1`. If `node` equals `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`node` is the value of `start`, and `graph[node]` contains at least one element. If `nei` is not in the `prev` set, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is appended to `que`. If `nei` is already in the `prev` set, the program proceeds without modifying `prev` or `que`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`node` is the value of `start`, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`node` is the value of `start`, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as usual.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
