The code assigns the current value of `node` to the key `nei` in the dictionary `prev`. This means that `prev[nei]` now holds the value of `node`.

Output State: **`node` is the value of `start`, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, `nei` is not in the `prev` set, and `prev[nei]` is set to `node`.**
