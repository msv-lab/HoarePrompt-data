The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` contains the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)` returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
