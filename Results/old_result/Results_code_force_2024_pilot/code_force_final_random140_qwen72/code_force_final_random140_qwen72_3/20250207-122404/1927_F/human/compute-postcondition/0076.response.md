Output State: **`node` is the value of `start`, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, `que` now includes `nei`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as usual.**
