Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The `edges` list is still a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`). The `graph` remains a defaultdict of lists, and `i` is 0. The `dsu` instance is updated to reflect the final connected components formed by the union operations. If any two vertices `u` and `v` were found to be in the same component before being unioned, `_min_edge` will be the smallest weight `w` of such an edge, and `start` and `end` will be the corresponding vertices `u` and `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` remains -1, and `end` remains -1.**
