The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and it is decremented by 1 from the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.

Since `test_cases` was greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration and is decremented by 1, for the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must now be at least 1 (which means it was at least 2 before the decrement).

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous iteration, so it was at least 2 before the decrement), `func_6()` has been called twice.**
