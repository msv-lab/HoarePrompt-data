The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` contains at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, and `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nei` must be set to the next element in `graph[node]`. Since `nei` was the next element in `graph[node]` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `nei` must now refer to the subsequent element in `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` has more elements, `nei` will be set to the next one.

Therefore, the state adjustment is as follows:
- `nei` is set to the next element in `graph[node]`.
- `graph[node]` still contains at least one element (since it had at least one element at the end of the last iteration and we are moving to the next element).

State: **`node` is the value of `start`, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`**.
