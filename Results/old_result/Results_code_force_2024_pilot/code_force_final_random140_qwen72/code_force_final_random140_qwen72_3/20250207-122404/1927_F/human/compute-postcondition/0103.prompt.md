Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *After all iterations, `node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element. If `node` is equal to `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `nei` is appended to `que` and `prev` is updated to map `nei` to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends and the next iteration begins immediately.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `nei` is appended to `que` and `prev` is updated to map `nei` to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends, and the next iteration begins immediately.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `nei` is appended to `que` and `prev` is updated to map `nei` to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
