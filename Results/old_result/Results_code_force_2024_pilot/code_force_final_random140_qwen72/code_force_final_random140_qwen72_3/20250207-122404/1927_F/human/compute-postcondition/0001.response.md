To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables or objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case are `_` and `test_cases`.

- The variable `_` is a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. This variable does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically managed by the loop.
- The variable `test_cases` is crucial because it determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Given that `test_cases` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1`, we need to ensure that `func_1` returns a positive integer. However, since we cannot adjust the return value of `func_1` directly, we can only state the condition that `test_cases` must meet for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
