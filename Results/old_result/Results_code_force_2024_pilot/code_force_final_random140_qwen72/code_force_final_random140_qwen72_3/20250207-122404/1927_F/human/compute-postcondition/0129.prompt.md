Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The `edges` list is still a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`). The `graph` remains a defaultdict of lists, and `i` is 0. The `dsu` instance is updated to reflect the final connected components formed by the union operations. If any two vertices `u` and `v` were found to be in the same component before being unioned, `_min_edge` will be the smallest weight `w` of such an edge, and `start` and `end` will be the corresponding vertices `u` and `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` remains -1, and `end` remains -1. The `que` is initialized as a deque containing the value of `start`. The `prev` dictionary is initialized with the key `start` and the value `-1`.
Code of the loop:
while que:
    node = que.popleft()
    if node == end:
        break
    for nei in graph[node]:
        if node == start and nei == end:
            continue
        if nei not in prev:
            prev[nei] = node
            que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed neighbor from `graph[start]` that was not equal to `end`, and `que` will contain all neighbors of `start` that were not previously in `prev`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations, `node` will be the last element that was processed from `que`, and `que` will contain all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were neighbors of the processed nodes, mapping each neighbor to its corresponding `node`. If `node` is equal to `end`, the loop will terminate early. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `node` is the last element that was processed from `que`, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed, excluding the elements that were just removed. The `prev` dictionary has entries for all nodes that were neighbors of the processed nodes, mapping each neighbor to its corresponding `node`. If `node` is equal to `end`, the loop terminated early. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `que` may be empty if all elements were processed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
