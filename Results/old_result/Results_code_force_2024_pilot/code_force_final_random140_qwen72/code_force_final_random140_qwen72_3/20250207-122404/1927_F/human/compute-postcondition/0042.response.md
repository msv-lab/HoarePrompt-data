The only objects in the loop head are the variables `w`, `u`, and `v`, which are part of the tuple being iterated over from the `edges` list. The loop iterates over the `edges` list, and at the start of the next iteration, the next tuple `(w, u, v)` from the list will be used.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`, and the tuple `(w, u, v)` is the second-to-last tuple in `edges`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `edges` must be the last tuple, and `i` should be `m - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the use of the last tuple in `edges` for `(w, u, v)`, and `i` should be `m - 1`.

State: **`parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 1`, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`, `(w, u, v)` is the last tuple in `edges`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `u` and `v` are now in the same set as determined by the `dsu.union(u, v)` method, and `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged (i.e., `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` remains -1, and `end` remains -1).**
