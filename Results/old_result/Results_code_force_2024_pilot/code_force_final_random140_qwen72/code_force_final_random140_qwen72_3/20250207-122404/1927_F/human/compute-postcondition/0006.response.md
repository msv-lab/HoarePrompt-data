Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous iteration, so it was at least 2 before the decrement), `func_6()` has been called three times.** 

The function `func_6()` is called again, incrementing the number of times it has been called from two to three. The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
