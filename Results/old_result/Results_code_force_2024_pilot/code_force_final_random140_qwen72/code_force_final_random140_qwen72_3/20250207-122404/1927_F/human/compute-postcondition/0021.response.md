Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5); `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`); `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, where each key `u` has a list of length equal to the number of times `u` was used as a vertex in the edges added to the graph; `i` is `m - 1`; `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`; `_min_edge` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `_min_edge` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the other variables, so their initial states remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `_min_edge`.
