To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects directly involved in the loop head, which in this case are `nei` and `graph[node]`.

1. **`graph[node]`**: This must be a non-empty list or iterable for the loop to execute at least once. If `graph[node]` is empty, the loop will not run.

2. **`nei`**: This variable will take on the values from `graph[node]` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be explicitly set before the loop, as it will be assigned within the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `graph[node]` contains at least one element. The other variables mentioned in the state description do not affect the loop's ability to execute and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element. If `node` is equal to `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
