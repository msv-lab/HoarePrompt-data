Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5); `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`); `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, where each key `u` has a list of length equal to the number of times `u` was used as a vertex in the edges added to the graph; `i` is `m - 1`; `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`; `_min_edge` is infinity; `start` is -1; `end` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        _min_edge = w
        start = u
        end = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`). `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 1`, and `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`. `(w, u, v)` is the first tuple in `edges`. `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, and `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `u` and `v` are now in the same set according to the `dsu` union operation, and `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` remains -1, and `end` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 2`, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`, `(w, u, v)` is the second-to-last tuple in `edges`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `u` and `v` are now in the same set as determined by the `dsu.union(u, v)` method, and `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged (i.e., `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` remains -1, and `end` remains -1).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`parent_u` is updated to the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 1`, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`, `(w, u, v)` is the last tuple in `edges`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` remains -1, `end` remains -1, and `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component in the `dsu` structure.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
