Output State: **After all iterations, `node` will be the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, and `que` will contain all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed, excluding the element that was just removed. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were neighbors of the processed nodes, mapping each neighbor to its corresponding `node`. If `node` is equal to `end`, the loop will terminate early. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `que` must contain at least one element, unless it was exactly one element before the operation, in which case `que` will now be empty. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
