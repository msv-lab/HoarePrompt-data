Output State: **`parent_u` is updated to the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 1`, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`, `(w, u, v)` is the last tuple in `edges`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method, `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` remains -1, `end` remains -1, and `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component in the `dsu` structure.**
