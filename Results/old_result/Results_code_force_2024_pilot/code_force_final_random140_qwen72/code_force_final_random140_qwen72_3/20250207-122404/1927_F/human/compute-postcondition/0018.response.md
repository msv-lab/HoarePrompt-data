Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The `edges` list contains `m` tuples, each of the form `(w, u, v)`, where `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` during each iteration. The `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, where each key `u` has a list of length equal to the number of times `u` was used as a vertex in the edges added to the graph. The index `i` is `m - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `m` iterations.**

This means that after the loop finishes, the `edges` list will contain all the edges added during the loop, and the `graph` will have updated adjacency lists for each vertex, reflecting the connections made by the edges. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `m - 1`, showing that the loop has run `m` times.
