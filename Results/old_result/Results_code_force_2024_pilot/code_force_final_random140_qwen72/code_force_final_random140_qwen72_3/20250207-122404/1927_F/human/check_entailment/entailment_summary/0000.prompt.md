Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts the resulting string to an integer, and returns this integer value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads the first line of input from the user, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns this modified line. The function leaves no lasting impact on the program state beyond the returned value.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())

 '''
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input (stdin) and returns them as a list of integers. It does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program state includes a list of integers derived from the input line.
Function number 5 :

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` constructs a graph from a given number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, where each edge is represented by a tuple `(w, u, v)` indicating the weight `w` and the vertices `u` and `v` it connects. It then sorts these edges in descending order by weight and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum weight cycle in the graph. If a cycle is found, it identifies the minimum weight edge in the cycle and the path forming the cycle. Finally, it prints the minimum weight of the cycle, the length of the cycle path, and the nodes in the cycle path in reverse order. If no cycle is found, it prints the minimum weight as infinity and an empty path.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a number of test cases using `func_1`, and then iterates over this number, calling `func_6` for each test case. After the function completes, the number of times `func_6` has been called is equal to the number of test cases initially read by `func_1`. The function does not return any value.
