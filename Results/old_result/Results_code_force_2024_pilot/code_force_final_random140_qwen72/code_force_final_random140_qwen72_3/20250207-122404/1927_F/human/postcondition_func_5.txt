The function `func_6` constructs a graph from a given number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, where each edge is represented by a tuple `(w, u, v)` indicating the weight `w` and the vertices `u` and `v` it connects. It then sorts these edges in descending order by weight and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum weight cycle in the graph. If a cycle is found, it identifies the minimum weight edge in the cycle and the path forming the cycle. Finally, it prints the minimum weight of the cycle, the length of the cycle path, and the nodes in the cycle path in reverse order. If no cycle is found, it prints the minimum weight as infinity and an empty path.
