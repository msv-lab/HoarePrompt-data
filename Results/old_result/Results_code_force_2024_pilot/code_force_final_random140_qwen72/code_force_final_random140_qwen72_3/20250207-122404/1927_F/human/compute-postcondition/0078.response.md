Output State: **After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed neighbor from `graph[start]` that was not equal to `end`, and `que` will contain all neighbors of `start` that were not previously in `prev`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`node`**: After the loop completes, `node` will be the last neighbor of `start` that was processed and did not cause the loop to skip due to the condition `if node == start and nei == end`.
- **`que`**: The deque `que` will contain all neighbors of `start` that were not already in the `prev` dictionary before the loop started.
- **`prev`**: The `prev` dictionary will have new entries for each neighbor of `start` that was processed, where each neighbor is mapped to `start`.
- **Other Variables**: All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
