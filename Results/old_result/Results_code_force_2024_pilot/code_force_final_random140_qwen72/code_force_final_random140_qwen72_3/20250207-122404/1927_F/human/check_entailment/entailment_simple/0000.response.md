Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually. It uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases and `func_3` to read the number of vertices and edges for each test case.

2. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and stores the edges in a list. This is done correctly in `func_6`.

3. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is necessary to find the lightest edge in a cycle. This is done correctly in `func_6`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to keep track of connected components. This is used to detect cycles by checking if two vertices are already in the same component before unioning them. This is implemented correctly in `func_6`.

5. **Cycle Detection**: When a cycle is detected (i.e., when two vertices are in the same component), the program records the lightest edge in the cycle. This is done correctly in `func_6`.

6. **Path Reconstruction**: The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to reconstruct the cycle from the start to the end vertex. This is done correctly in `func_6`.

7. **Output**: The program outputs the lightest edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in the cycle. This is done correctly in `func_6`.

8. **Thread Management**: The program sets up threading to handle large inputs, which is a good practice for performance optimization. This is done correctly in the main block.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
