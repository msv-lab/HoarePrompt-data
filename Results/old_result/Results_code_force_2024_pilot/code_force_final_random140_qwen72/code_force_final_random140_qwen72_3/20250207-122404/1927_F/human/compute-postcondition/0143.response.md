Based on the initial state provided:

- `node` will be the last processed node from `que` or `end` if it was reached.
- `que` will be empty.
- `prev` is a dictionary that maps each node to its predecessor in the path.
- If `end` was reached, the loop terminated early when `node` became `end`.
- `path` is a list containing the full path from `end` back to `start` (or the first node in the path that has no predecessor).
- `curr` is set to `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed and no more predecessors can be found.

The `print(*path[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `path` list in reverse order. Since `path` contains the full path from `end` back to `start`, reversing it will give the path from `start` to `end`.

Output: **[start, ..., end] (where [start, ..., end] is the list of nodes from start to end in the path)**

This means the output will be a sequence of nodes starting from `start` and ending at `end`, representing the path taken. The exact nodes will depend on the specific graph and the path found, but the format will always be a list of nodes from `start` to `end`.
