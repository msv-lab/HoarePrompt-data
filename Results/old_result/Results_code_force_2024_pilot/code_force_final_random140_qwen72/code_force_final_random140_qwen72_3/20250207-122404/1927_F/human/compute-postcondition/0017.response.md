The code appends the tuple `(w, u, v)` to the list `edges`. This means that the new tuple `(w, u, v)` is added to the existing list of tuples in `edges`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` contains the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)` returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v, v, v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u, u, u]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`**. 

The only change is that the list `edges` now includes the additional tuple `(w, u, v)`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
