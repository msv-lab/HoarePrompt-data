Initial State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given a value of 3.
- The `print` statement will print the value of `i` twice, separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **3 3**
