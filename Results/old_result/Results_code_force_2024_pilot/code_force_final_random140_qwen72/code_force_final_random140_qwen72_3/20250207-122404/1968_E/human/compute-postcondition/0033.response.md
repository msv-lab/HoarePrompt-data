Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases `t` plus the last value of `n` for each test case, and `n` remains unchanged for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached a value that is the sum of the number of test cases `t` and the final value of `n` for each test case. The variable `n` for each test case remains the same as it was when the test case started.
