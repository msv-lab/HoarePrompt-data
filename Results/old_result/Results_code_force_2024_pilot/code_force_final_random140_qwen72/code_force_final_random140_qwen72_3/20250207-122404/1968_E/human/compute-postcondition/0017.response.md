The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts from 3 and goes up to `n + 2 - 1` (or `n + 1`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to 4, and `n` must still be such that `i` is less than `n + 2`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be 4.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since `i` must be less than `n + 2`).

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
