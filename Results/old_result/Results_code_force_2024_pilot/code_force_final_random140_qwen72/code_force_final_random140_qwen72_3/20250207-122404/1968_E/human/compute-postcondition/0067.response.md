The function `func` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` within the range of 2 to 10^3, and there are `t` such test cases where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to handle these test cases according to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it handles an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The specific output for each test case is not defined in the provided information.**
