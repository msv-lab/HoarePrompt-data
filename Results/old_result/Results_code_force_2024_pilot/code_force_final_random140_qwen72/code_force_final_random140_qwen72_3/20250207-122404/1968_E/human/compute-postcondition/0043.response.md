Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 50)
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5
- `j` is 5

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down the execution of this statement:

1. `str(j)` converts the value of `j` to a string. Since `j` is 5, `str(j)` will be `'5'`.
2. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string `'5'`, a space `' '`, and another `'5'`.
3. The result of the concatenation is `'5 5'`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **5 5**
