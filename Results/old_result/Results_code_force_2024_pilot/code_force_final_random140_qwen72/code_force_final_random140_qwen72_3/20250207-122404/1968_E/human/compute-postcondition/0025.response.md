Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n + 3`.
- `n` is an input integer greater than the previous value of `n + 3`.
- `int(input())` must be greater than the previous value of `n + 3`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, 2)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The `print` statement simply prints the numbers 1 and 2.

### Explanation:
- The values `1` and `2` are constants and do not change regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, or the input.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always output the same result.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2**
