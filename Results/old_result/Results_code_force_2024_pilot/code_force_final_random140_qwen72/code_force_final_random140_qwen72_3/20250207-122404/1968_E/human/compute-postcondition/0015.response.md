To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(3, n + 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(3, n + 2)` contains at least one element. This means that the start value (3) must be less than the stop value (`n + 2`).
3. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is the original `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `n + 2` must be greater than 3. This simplifies to `n > 1`.
- The variable `i` should be set to the start value of the range, which is 3.

### Final State:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
