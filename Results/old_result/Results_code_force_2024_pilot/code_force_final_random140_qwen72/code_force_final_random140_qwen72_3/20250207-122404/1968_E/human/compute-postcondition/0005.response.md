Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0.
2. The variable `n` is mentioned but not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.
3. The `print` statement prints the value of `i` twice.

Given that `i` is 0, the `print` statement will output two zeros separated by a space.

Output: **0 0**
