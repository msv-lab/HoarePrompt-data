Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\).
- `n` is a new input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement prints the value of `i` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 2, the output will be:

Output: **2 **

The value of `i` is 2, and the `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space.
