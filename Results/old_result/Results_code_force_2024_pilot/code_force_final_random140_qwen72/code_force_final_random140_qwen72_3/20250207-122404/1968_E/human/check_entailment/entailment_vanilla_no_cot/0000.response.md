Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the pattern used in the solution (starting with (1, 1) and (1, 2), then printing (i, i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n+1\)) does not ensure that the maximum number of unique Manhattan distances is achieved. For example, when \(n = 3\), the output will be:

```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```

This results in the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 4\}\), which has 3 elements. However, a better arrangement could achieve a larger set of unique distances, such as:

```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

Which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), having 4 elements, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not always produce the optimal set of points to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
