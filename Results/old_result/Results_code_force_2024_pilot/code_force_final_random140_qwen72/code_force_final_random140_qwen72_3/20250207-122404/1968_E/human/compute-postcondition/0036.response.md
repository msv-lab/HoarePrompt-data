Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- If `n` == 3, the condition for `j` remains unchanged.
- If `n` â‰¥ 4, `j` is set to `n` and `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `j`.
- If `n` < 4, `j` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 1')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'1 1'`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement is not using any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'1 1'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.

Output: **1 1**
