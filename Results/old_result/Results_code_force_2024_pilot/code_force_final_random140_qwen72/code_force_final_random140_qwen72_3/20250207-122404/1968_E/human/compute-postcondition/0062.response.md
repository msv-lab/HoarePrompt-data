Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\).
- `n` is a new input integer such that \(4 < n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 3.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(i)
```

This statement will print the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 3.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **3**
