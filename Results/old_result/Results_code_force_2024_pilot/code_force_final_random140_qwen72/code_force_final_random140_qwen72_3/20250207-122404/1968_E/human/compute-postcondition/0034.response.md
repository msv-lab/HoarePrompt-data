The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function likely accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. For each of these `t` test cases, `n` is an integer representing a specific value for that test case, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.

Given the lack of explicit output description, we can infer that the function processes these parameters and likely returns some result for each test case, but the exact nature of the output is not specified in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). The function processes these parameters and returns some result for each test case, though the exact nature of the output is not specified.**
