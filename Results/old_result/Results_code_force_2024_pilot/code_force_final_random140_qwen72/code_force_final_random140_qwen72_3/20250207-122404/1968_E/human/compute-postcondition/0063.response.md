Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\), `n` is a new input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `i` is \(n-2\) (if the loop completes all iterations).**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` also remains unchanged because it is only used to define the range of the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-2` (inclusive). Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-2`.
