Initial State: `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 3

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The variable `i` is explicitly given a value of 5.
2. The variable `n` is mentioned but not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
3. The print statement `print(i, i)` will print the value of `i` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **5 5**
