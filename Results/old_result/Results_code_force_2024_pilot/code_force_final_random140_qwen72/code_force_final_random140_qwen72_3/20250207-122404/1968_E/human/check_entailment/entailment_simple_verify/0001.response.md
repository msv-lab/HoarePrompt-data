Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to place `n` points in an `n x n` grid such that the number of unique Manhattan distances between any two points is maximized. The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is defined as `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints the first point as `(1, 1)`.
   - It prints the second point as `(1, 2)`.
   - For the remaining points, it prints `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n + 1`.

3. **Evaluating the Output**:
   - The first two points are always `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which ensures a distance of `1` between them.
   - The remaining points are placed along the diagonal starting from `(3, 3)` up to `(n+1, n+1)`. This means the points are `(3, 3)`, `(4, 4)`, ..., `(n+1, n+1)`.

4. **Checking the Distances**:
   - The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is `1`.
   - The distance between `(1, 1)` and any point `(i, i)` (for `i >= 3`) is `|1 - i| + |1 - i| = 2(i - 1)`.
   - The distance between `(1, 2)` and any point `(i, i)` (for `i >= 3`) is `|1 - i| + |2 - i| = 2(i - 1.5)`.
   - The distance between any two points `(i, i)` and `(j, j)` (for `i < j`) is `|i - j| + |i - j| = 2(j - i)`.

5. **Maximizing Unique Distances**:
   - The distances generated by the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` include a variety of values, but they are not necessarily all unique.
   - For example, the distance between `(1, 1)` and `(3, 3)` is `4`, and the distance between `(1, 2)` and `(3, 3)` is also `4`. This means the solution does not maximize the number of unique distances.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not ensure that the number of unique Manhattan distances is maximized. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

Final: **False**
