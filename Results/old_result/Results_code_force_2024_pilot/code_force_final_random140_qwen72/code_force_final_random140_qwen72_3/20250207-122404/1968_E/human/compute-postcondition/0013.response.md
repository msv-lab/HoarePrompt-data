The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is the original `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(1, 1)`.
   - This statement prints two constants, both of which are the integer `1`.

3. **Variables Involved**:
   - The variables `i` and `n` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement only uses the constants `1` and `1`.

4. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement directly prints the constants `1` and `1`, the output will be `1 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 1**
