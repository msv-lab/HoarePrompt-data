Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\).
- `n` is a new input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(i)
```

The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2. Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`.

Output: **2**
