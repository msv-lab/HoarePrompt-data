Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\).
- `n` is a new input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 1, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
