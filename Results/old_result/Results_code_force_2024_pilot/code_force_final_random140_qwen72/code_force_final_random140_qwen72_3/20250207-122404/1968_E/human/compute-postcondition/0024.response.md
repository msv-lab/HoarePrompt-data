Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n + 3`.
- `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3` (previous `n` value).
- `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3` (previous `n` value).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides information about the variables `i` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the integers `1` and `1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the same values regardless of the initial state because the values being printed are hardcoded as `1` and `1`.

Output: **1, 1**
