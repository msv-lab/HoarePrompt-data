The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will start with `i` taking values from 3 up to `n + 1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n + 2` must be greater than 3, meaning `n` must be at least 2. The initial value of `i` is not relevant for the loop's condition, but it should be noted that the loop variable `i` will start from 3.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
