Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 50)
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `j` is 4

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 4.
2. The print statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `'4'`.
3. The print statement concatenates this string with a space and another instance of the same string, resulting in `'4 4'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **4 4**
