The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Based on the initial state, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case involves two integers `n` and `k` with specific ranges. After executing the code, `n` and `k` are updated with the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.**
