To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `wins_with_swap`, and `k`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `wins_with_swap + 1`
   - `wins_with_swap` is `wins_with_swap + 1`
   - The loop exits if `a[i] > a[k - 1]`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `wins_with_swap + 2`.
- `wins_with_swap` remains `wins_with_swap + 1` (as it was updated at the end of the previous iteration).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` is `wins_with_swap + 2`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins_with_swap + 1`, and the loop is exited if `a[i] > a[k - 1]`.**
