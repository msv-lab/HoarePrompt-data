To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or `n` if no such element exists.
- `wins_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` starting from `wins_with_swap` until the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered or the end of the list is reached.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `wins`**:
   - `wins` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`.

2. **Understanding `i`**:
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]`. If no such element exists, `i` is set to `n`.

3. **Understanding `wins_with_swap`**:
   - `wins_with_swap` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` starting from the position after `wins` until the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered or the end of the list is reached.

4. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `wins - 1`: This subtracts 1 from `wins`.
   - `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`: This expression calculates the difference between `wins_with_swap` and `wins`, subtracts 1, and adds 1 if `wins` is greater than 0.

5. **Max Function**:
   - The `max` function returns the maximum value between `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the maximum value between:
- `wins - 1`
- `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the maximum of these two values.

Output: **max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)) (where `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, and `wins_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` starting from `wins_with_swap` until the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered or the end of the list is reached)**
