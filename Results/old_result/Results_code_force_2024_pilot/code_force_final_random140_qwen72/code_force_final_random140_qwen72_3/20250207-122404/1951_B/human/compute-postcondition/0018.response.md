Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or `n` if no such element exists.
- The current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(wins - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `wins`**:
   - `wins` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`.
   - This means `wins` includes the element at index `k-1` itself and all elements before it that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.

2. **Understanding `i`**:
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]`.
   - If no such element exists, `i` is set to `n`.

3. **Current Value of `wins`**:
   - It is given that the current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **What is Printed**:
   - The code snippet `print(wins - 1)` will print the value of `wins` minus 1.
   - Since `wins` includes the element at index `k-1` itself, subtracting 1 from `wins` will give the count of elements strictly less than `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`)**
