Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` is `wins_with_swap + 1`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins_with_swap + 1`, and the loop is exited.** 

The `break` statement causes the loop to exit immediately, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged except that the loop is no longer executing.
