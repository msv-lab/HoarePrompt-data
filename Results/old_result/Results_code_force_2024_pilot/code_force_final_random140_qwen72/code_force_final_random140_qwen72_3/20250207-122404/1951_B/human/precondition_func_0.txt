t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the number of cows and the index of your cow, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. All a_i's are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
