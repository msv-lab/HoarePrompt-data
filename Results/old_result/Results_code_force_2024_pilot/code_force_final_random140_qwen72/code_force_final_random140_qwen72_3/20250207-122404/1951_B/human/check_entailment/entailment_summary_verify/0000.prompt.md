You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins += 1
    if wins >= k:
        print(wins - 1)
    wins_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins_with_swap += 1
    print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings `a`. For each test case, it calculates the number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to your cow's rating (`a[k-1]`) before encountering a cow with a higher rating. If this count is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints the count minus one. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible number of cows that can be ahead of your cow after a potential swap, and prints this value. The function reads input from the standard input and prints the results to the standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
6 2
10 12 14 11 8 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
The program will output an incorrect result.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `n = 6`, `k = 2`
   - `a = [10, 12, 14, 11, 8, 3]`

2. **Without Swap:**
   - The initial position of the cow with index 2 is 12.
   - The first match is between 10 and 12. The cow with 12 wins.
   - The second match is between 12 and 14. The cow with 14 wins.
   - Therefore, without any swap, the cow with 12 wins 1 match.

3. **With Swap:**
   - To maximize the number of wins, we should consider swapping the cow with 12 to a position where it can win more matches.
   - Swapping 12 to position 3 (index 2) would result in:
     - Initial: `[10, 14, 12, 11, 8, 3]`
     - First match: 10 vs 14, 14 wins.
     - Second match: 14 vs 12, 14 wins.
     - Third match: 12 vs 11, 12 wins.
     - Fourth match: 12 vs 8, 12 wins.
     - Fifth match: 12 vs 3, 12 wins.
   - Therefore, with the swap, the cow with 12 wins 3 matches.

However, the provided program does not correctly handle this scenario. The logic for calculating the number of wins with and without swaps is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically the scenario where the optimal swap can significantly increase the number of wins. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
