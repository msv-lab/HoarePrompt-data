To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

- The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(n)` function, starting from 0.
- The variable `n` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (ensures that `n` is greater than 0).
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n (not relevant to the loop execution).
- `a` is a list of integers read from input (not relevant to the loop execution).
- `wins` is 0 (not relevant to the loop execution).

Since `n` is already guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will execute at least once. The only adjustment needed is to set `i` to its initial value, which is 0, as determined by the `range(n)` function.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is 0, `i` is 0**
