Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` is the loop variable starting from `wins_with_swap`, `wins_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
