To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user.
- `l` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`.
- `c` is the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers that did not trigger a reset due to encountering a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.

### Expression Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```
(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007
```

Let's break it down:

1. **`2 ** k`**: This calculates 2 raised to the power of `k`.
2. **`2 ** k * maxi`**: This multiplies the result of `2 ** k` by `maxi`.
3. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi`**: This subtracts `maxi` from the result of `2 ** k * maxi`.
4. **`sum(l)`**: This calculates the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
5. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)`**: This adds the result of `sum(l)` to the result of `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`.
6. **`(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`**: This takes the result of the previous step and computes the modulo 1000000007 of it.

### Explanation of Variables:
- **`k`**: An integer input by the user.
- **`maxi`**: The maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`. Since `c` is the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers, `maxi` will be the highest such sum encountered.
- **`l`**: A list of integers input by the user.
- **`sum(l)`**: The sum of all elements in the list `l`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Since the exact values of `k`, `maxi`, and `l` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is the user-input integer, maxi is the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers in the list l, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
