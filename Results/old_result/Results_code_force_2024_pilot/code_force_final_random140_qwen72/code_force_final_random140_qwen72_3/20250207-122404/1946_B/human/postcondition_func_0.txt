The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a`. The function calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the following logic: it finds the maximum sum of contiguous positive elements in the list `a` (resetting the sum when encountering a negative element), and then computes a final value using this maximum sum, the total sum of the list, and the value of `k`. The result for each test case is printed modulo 1000000007. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
