The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the number of iterations is determined by the input value, and this value does not change during the execution of the loop, we cannot adjust it. We can only adjust `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and the condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than the input value.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in the list `l` plus any positive contributions from negative elements that did not trigger a reset.**
