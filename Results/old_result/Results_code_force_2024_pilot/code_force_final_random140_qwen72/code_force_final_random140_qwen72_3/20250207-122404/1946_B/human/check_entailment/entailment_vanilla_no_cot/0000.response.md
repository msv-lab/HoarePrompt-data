Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the operations. The approach taken in the code is to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum (which is not correctly implemented) and then use this value to calculate the final result. However, this does not correctly address the problem requirements.

The correct approach should consider the following points:
1. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
2. Each operation allows inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array.
3. The optimal strategy involves leveraging the largest possible sum of a contiguous subarray repeatedly.

A more accurate approach would involve:
- Calculating the sum of the entire array.
- Finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
- Using these values to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

The provided code does not correctly identify the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, and the formula used to compute the final result is also incorrect. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
