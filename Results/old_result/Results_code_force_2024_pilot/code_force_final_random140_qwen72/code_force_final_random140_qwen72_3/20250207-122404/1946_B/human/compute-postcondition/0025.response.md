The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the upper limit of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than this upper limit.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than the upper limit, which is determined by the user input. Since the user input does not change between iterations, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers that did not trigger a reset due to encountering a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.**
