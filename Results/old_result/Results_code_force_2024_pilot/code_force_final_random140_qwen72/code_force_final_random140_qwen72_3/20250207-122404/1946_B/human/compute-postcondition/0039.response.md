The code snippet sets the variable `c` to 0. This impacts the value of `c`, which was previously used to determine the value of `maxi`. However, since `maxi` is defined as the maximum of `c` and 0, and `c` is now set to 0, `maxi` remains 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is 0.**
