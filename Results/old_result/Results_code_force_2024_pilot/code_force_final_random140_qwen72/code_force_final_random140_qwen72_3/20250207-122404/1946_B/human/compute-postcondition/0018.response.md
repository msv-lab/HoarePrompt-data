The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `c` or `maxi`, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `maxi`. We only know that `maxi` will now hold the greater of the two values.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
