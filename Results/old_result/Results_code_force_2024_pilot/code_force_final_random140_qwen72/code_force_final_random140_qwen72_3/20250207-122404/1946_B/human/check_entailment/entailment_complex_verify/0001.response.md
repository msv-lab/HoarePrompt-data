### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum possible subarray sum.
   - If the array contains only non-negative elements, the maximum subarray sum is the sum of the entire array.
   - If the array contains negative elements, the maximum subarray sum might be a segment of the array that avoids negative contributions.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The given program attempts to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) and uses it to calculate the final sum after `k` operations.
   - The logic involves iterating through the array and keeping track of the current sum (`c`) and the maximum sum found so far (`maxi`).
   - If a negative element is encountered and the current sum (`c`) is less than or equal to the absolute value of the negative element, the current sum is reset to zero.
   - The final sum is calculated using the formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for resetting the current sum (`c`) when encountering a negative element is not optimal. It should consider the possibility of including the negative element in the subarray if it leads to a higher overall sum.
   - The formula used to calculate the final sum is not correct. The correct approach should involve multiplying the maximum subarray sum by \(2^k\) and adding the initial sum of the array, then taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct formula to calculate the final sum should be:
     \[
     \text{final\_sum} = (\text{sum(l)} + \text{maxi} \times (2^k - 1)) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the maximum subarray sum is added `k` times, and the initial sum of the array is included.

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical issues in how it handles negative elements and the formula used to calculate the final sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
