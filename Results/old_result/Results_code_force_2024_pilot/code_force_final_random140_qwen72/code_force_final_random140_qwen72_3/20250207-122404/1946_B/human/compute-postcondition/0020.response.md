The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`, which is the third element in the list `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The specific value of `c` after the increment depends on its initial value, which is not provided, but it is now `c + l[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is incremented by the value of `ele` (which is `l[2]`).**
