t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5), where n is the length of the array a and k is the number of operations. The array a consists of n integers (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
