The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum between the current value of `maxi` and the value of `c`. Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that has a value before this line of code is executed. The initial value of `maxi` is 0, so the new value of `maxi` will be the maximum of `c` and 0.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`.**
