Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is 0 and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is `c + ele` and `maxi` is 0.***
