Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and the current value of `ele` is negative, and the current value of `c` is 0.** 

The value of `c` is reset to 0, but all other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`, and `ele` are still valid.
