Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers that did not trigger a reset due to encountering a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.**

Explanation:
- The values of `i`, `l`, `maxi`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The variables `n` and `k` are now assigned the values input by the user, which are split and converted to integers.
