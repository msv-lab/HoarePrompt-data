Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a and the number of operations, respectively. a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array a. The sum of the values of n and k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers that did not trigger a reset due to encountering a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in the list `l` plus any positive contributions from negative elements that did not trigger a reset.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers with at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` since the last negative number encountered, or 0 if no positive elements were added since the last reset.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
