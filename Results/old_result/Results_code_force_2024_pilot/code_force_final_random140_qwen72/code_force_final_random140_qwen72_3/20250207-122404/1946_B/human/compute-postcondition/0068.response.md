Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0, and `c` is the second element in the list `l`.***
