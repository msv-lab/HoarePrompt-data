Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `c` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `c = 0` initializes the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the other variables, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `c` is now explicitly known to be 0.
