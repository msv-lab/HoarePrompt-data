Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by the value of `ele` (which is `l[2]`).***
