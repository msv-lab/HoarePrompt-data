Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop where `c` was reset to 0 due to encountering a negative `ele` whose absolute value was greater than or equal to `c`, and `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in the list `l` plus any positive contributions from negative elements that did not trigger a reset.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n` and `k` also remain unchanged as they are not used or modified within the loop.
- The list `l` remains unchanged as it is only iterated over and not modified.
- The variable `maxi` is updated to the maximum value of `c` whenever `c` is reset to 0 due to encountering a negative `ele` whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.
- The variable `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in the list `l` plus any positive contributions from negative elements that did not trigger a reset. If a negative element causes `c` to be reset to 0, `c` starts accumulating again from the next element.
