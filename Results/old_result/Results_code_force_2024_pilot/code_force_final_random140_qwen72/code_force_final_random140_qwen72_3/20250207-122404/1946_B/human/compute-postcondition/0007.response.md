Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and the current value of `ele` is negative, and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**

Explanation: The code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since both `c` and `maxi` are 0, the value of `maxi` remains 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
