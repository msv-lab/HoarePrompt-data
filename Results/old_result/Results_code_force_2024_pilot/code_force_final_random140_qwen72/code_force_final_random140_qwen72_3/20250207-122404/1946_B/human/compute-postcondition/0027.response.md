Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers that did not trigger a reset due to encountering a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers that did not trigger a reset due to encountering a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.
- After executing the code, the only change is that `l` now holds the list of integers input by the user. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `maxi`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
