Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers, `n` and `k` are the values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by `t` being at least 1).** 

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by `t` being at least 1) is still valid.
