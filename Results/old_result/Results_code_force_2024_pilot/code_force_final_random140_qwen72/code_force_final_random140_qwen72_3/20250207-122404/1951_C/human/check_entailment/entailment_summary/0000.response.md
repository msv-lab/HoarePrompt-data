### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: `n` (number of sale days), `m` (maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (total number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (list of prices per ticket for each day).
   - **Behavior**: The function sorts the `prices` list in ascending order and iteratively buys the minimum possible number of tickets (`tickets_to_buy`) from the cheapest available days until `k` tickets are purchased. The total cost is accumulated in `total_cost`.
   - **Output**: The function returns the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly implements the logic to minimize the total cost by always buying tickets from the cheapest available days. This approach ensures that the total cost is minimized, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of prices.
   - **Behavior**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the inputs, calling `func_1` with the inputs, and printing the result.
   - **Output**: For each test case, the function prints the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1` with the appropriate inputs. It also prints the results as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum spending for a single test case, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` and printing the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
