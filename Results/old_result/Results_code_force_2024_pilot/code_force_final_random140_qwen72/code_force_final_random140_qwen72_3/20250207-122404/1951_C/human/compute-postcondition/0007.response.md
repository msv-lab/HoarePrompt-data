The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, but it still needs to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`** 

However, to be more precise about the adjustment:

State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
