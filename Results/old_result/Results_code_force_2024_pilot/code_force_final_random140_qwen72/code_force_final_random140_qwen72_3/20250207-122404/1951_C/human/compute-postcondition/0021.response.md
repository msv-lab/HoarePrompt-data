Output State: **`total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[0] + tickets_to_buy * prices[1]`, `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `prices` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`. If `tickets_bought` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
