To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. This implies that `t` is a positive integer, and it has been decremented by 1.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. These are provided by the user.
   - `prices` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
   - `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

2. **Understanding the Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` takes four arguments: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.
   - The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific value of `result` without knowing the function's logic.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's return value.
   - The `print(result)` statement will print whatever value `func_1` returns when called with the given arguments.

Given the initial state and the lack of specific details about `func_1`, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by func_1(n, m, k, prices))**
