The code snippet `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `prices`.

- The initial state specifies that `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.
- After executing the code, `prices` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**.
