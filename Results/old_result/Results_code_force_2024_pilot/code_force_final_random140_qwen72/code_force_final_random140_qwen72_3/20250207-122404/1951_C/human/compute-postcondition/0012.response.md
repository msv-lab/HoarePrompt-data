The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
