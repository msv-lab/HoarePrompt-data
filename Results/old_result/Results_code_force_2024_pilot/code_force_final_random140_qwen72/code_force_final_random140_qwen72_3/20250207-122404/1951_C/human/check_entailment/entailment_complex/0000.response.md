Reasoning:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly sorts the `prices` list to ensure that the cheapest tickets are bought first.
   - It iterates through the sorted prices, buying the maximum number of tickets allowed per day (`min(m, k - tickets_bought)`) until it has bought `k` tickets.
   - The function correctly accumulates the total cost and breaks out of the loop once `k` tickets are bought.
   - The function returns the total cost, which is the minimum amount of money needed to purchase `k` tickets.

2. **Functionality of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices.
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.
   - The function correctly processes all test cases and prints the results.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than or equal to `m` (i.e., all tickets can be bought in one day).
   - It also handles cases where `k` is much larger than `m`, requiring multiple days to buy all tickets.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints are respected: `1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5`, `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)`, and `1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9`.
   - The function ensures that the total number of tickets bought does not exceed `k`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The sorting step in `func_1` has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The subsequent loop runs in \(O(n)\) time, making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\), which is acceptable for the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets the problem description and handles all edge cases and constraints correctly.

Correctness: **True**
