The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list `prices`. 

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of days, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5.
- `m` is a positive integer representing a multiplier, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to buy, where 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers, each representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days, where 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9.

The function returns the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets over the given `n` days, considering the prices and the multiplier `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `prices`. It returns the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the prices and the multiplier `m`.**
