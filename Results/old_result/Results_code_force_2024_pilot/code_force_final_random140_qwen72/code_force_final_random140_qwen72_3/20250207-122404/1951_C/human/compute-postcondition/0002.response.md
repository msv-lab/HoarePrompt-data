The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, indicating that the loop will run `t` times without using the loop index.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `_` is not relevant since it is redefined by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
