Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now set to the input integers provided by the user.
- The initial state information about `t` being `t - 1` and must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- The initial state information about `prices` being a new list of integers provided by the user remains unchanged.
- The initial state information about `result` being the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` remains unchanged.
