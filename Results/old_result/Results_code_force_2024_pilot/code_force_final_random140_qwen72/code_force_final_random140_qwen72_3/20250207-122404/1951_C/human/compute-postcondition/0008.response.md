Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user through the `input()` function.
- The initial state mentions that `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged.
- The `prices` list remains as a list of integers provided by the user.
- The `result` variable is still the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`, which is not affected by the code snippet.
