Output State: **`total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying up to `k` tickets at the lowest available prices from the sorted `prices` list, `tickets_bought` is `k`, `prices` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is unchanged, `i` is the index where the loop stopped (either because `tickets_bought` reached `k` or the loop completed all `n` iterations), `tickets_to_buy` is the last calculated value of `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` before the loop terminated, and `cost` is the last calculated value of `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]` before the loop terminated.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `total_cost` will be the total amount spent on buying exactly `k` tickets, using the lowest prices available from the sorted `prices` list.
- The `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, indicating that the desired number of tickets has been purchased.
- The `prices` list will remain sorted in ascending order, as it was initially.
- The `n` variable will remain unchanged, representing the total number of prices available.
- The `i` variable will be the index at which the loop stopped, either because `tickets_bought` reached `k` or because the loop completed all `n` iterations.
- The `tickets_to_buy` variable will hold the last calculated value of how many tickets were bought in the final iteration of the loop.
- The `cost` variable will hold the last calculated cost of buying tickets in the final iteration of the loop.
