Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals, `v` is `s`, and `postorder` is either `False` or `True`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` contains the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is `True`, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components[v]` is the total count of good components (components where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`) and their children's good components, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of the sizes of all components that did not meet the minimum size requirement `x`.***
