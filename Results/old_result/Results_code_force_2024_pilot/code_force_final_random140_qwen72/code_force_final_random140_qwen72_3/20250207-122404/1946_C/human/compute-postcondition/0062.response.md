Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `remaining_size[v]` is updated by adding the value of `remaining_size[u]` to it. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
