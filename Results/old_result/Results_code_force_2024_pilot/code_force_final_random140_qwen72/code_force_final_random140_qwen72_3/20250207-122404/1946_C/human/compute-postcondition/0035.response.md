The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(a, b)` represents an edge between vertices `a` and `b`. The function returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree such that the remaining graph remains connected.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices), `k` (an integer representing the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges between vertices). It returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree while ensuring the remaining graph remains connected.**
