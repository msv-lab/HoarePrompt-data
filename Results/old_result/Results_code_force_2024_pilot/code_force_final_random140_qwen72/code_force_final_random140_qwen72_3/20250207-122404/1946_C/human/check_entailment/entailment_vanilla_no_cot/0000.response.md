Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Variable Scope and Initialization**: The `dfs` function and `check` function use variables `g` and `visited` which are defined in `func_1`. However, these functions do not have access to these variables unless they are passed as arguments or defined globally. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The variable `r` should be initialized to `n // (k + 1)` instead of `n // k + 1` because we need to ensure that after removing `k` edges, the remaining components can still have at least `x` vertices. The current initialization might lead to an incorrect upper bound.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is supposed to return the size of the component and the number of edges that can be removed. However, the logic inside the `dfs` function is not correctly implemented to handle the removal of edges and the calculation of the component size.

4. **Check Function**: The `check` function is supposed to verify if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The current implementation does not correctly handle the edge removal and component size checks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    
    def dfs(x, y):
        c = 1
        r = 0
        visited.add(x)
        for node in g[x]:
            if node not in visited:
                (ans, rn) = dfs(node, y)
                r += rn
                if ans < y:
                    c += ans
                else:
                    r += 1
        return (c, r)
    
    def check(x):
        visited.clear()
        (ans, r) = dfs(1, x)
        return ans >= x and r >= k
    
    l = 1
    r = n // (k + 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
    func_1(n, k, edges)
```

This corrected version ensures that the variables are properly scoped, the binary search logic is correct, and the DFS and check functions are implemented to handle the problem requirements accurately.
