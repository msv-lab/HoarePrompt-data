Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is true, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `good_components[u]` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]` as its value, `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]` increments the value of `remaining_size[v]` by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `remaining_size[v]` is now `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`.
