The value of `r` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next neighbor of `x` in `g[x]` after the current `node`, if `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`, if `node` is in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` remain undefined, `r` is now `r_initial + rn_value + 1`.**
