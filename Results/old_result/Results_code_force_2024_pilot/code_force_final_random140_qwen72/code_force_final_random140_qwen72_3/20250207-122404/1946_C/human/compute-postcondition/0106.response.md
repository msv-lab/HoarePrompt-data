Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `v` as a vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is false, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have `n` children, and `stack` now includes `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` at the top, in the order they were appended. If `postorder` is true, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, plus 1 (the initial value of `remaining_size[v]`). The `stack`, `postorder`, and `tree` remain unchanged.***
