The value of `good_components[v]` is updated by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it. Since `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the value of `good_components[u]` is added to `good_components[v]`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is now equal to its original value plus `good_components[u]`.**
