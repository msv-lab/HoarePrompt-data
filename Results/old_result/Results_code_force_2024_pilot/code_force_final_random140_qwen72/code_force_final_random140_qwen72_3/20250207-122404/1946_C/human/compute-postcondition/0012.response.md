Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element (i.e., `x` must have at least one neighbor). If `node` is not in the `visited` set, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned from the `dfs` function call. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `r` is updated to `rn + 1` and `c` remains 1. Otherwise, if `ans` is less than `y`, then `c` is updated to `1 + ans` and `r` remains `rn`. If `node` is in the `visited` set, `c` and `r` remain unchanged.***
