Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually. The use of a queue `q` to store the test cases seems unnecessary since the program could directly process each test case as it is read. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs the adjacency list `g` correctly using the input edges. Each vertex is connected to its neighbors as specified by the input.

3. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search setup is correct. The variable `l` starts at 1, and `r` starts at `n // k + 1`, which is a reasonable upper bound for the maximum component size after removing `k` edges.

4. **DFS Function (`dfs`)**: The DFS function is designed to explore the tree and count the number of connected components of size at least `y`. The function correctly updates the `visited` set and calculates the size of the current component (`c`) and the number of removable edges (`r`).

5. **Check Function (`check`)**: The `check` function uses the DFS function to verify if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The logic is sound: it clears the `visited` set, performs a DFS starting from vertex 1, and checks if the number of removable edges (`r`) is at least `k` and the size of the component (`ans`) is at least `x`.

6. **Binary Search Execution**: The binary search correctly narrows down the maximum value of `x` such that the conditions are met. The final value of `r` is printed, which is the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returned `False`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
