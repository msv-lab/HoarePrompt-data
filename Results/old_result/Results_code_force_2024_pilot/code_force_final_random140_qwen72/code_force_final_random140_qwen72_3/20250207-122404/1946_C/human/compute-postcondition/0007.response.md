Functionality: ** The function `check` takes a positive integer `x` as input and determines whether, after removing `k` edges from a graph, all remaining connected components have at least `x` nodes. It returns `True` if this condition is met, and `False` otherwise. The function also clears the `visited` set before performing its checks. **
