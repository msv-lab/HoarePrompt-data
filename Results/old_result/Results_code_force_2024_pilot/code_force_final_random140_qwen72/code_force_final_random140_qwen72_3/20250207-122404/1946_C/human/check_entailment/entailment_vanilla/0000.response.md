### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This is done correctly by iterating over the edges and appending each vertex to the adjacency list of the other vertex.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes the binary search range with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. This is a reasonable setup because the maximum possible value for `x` is `n // k + 1`, which is the average size of the components if the tree is divided into `k + 1` components.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The binary search loop correctly updates the range based on whether the current midpoint `mid` satisfies the condition checked by the `check` function. If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means that it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each component has at least `mid` vertices, so we try a larger value by setting `l = mid + 1`. Otherwise, we set `r = mid - 1`.

4. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the tree and count the number of components and their sizes. It correctly marks nodes as visited and recursively explores the neighbors.
   - The function returns a tuple `(c, r)` where `c` is the size of the current component and `r` is the number of components formed by removing edges.

5. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to verify if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each component has at least `x` vertices. It clears the `visited` set before starting the DFS and checks if the total number of components formed is at least `k` and each component has at least `x` vertices.

6. **Output**:
   - The final result is printed as `r`, which is the maximum value of `x` found by the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The binary search, DFS, and checking functions are all implemented correctly and logically consistent with the problem requirements.
