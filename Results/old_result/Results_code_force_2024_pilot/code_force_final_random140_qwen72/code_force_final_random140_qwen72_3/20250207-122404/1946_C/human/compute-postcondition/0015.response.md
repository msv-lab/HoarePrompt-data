The code snippet `r += rn` increments the variable `r` by the value of `rn`. Given the initial state, `r` and `rn` are the results from the `dfs` function calls, and `rn` is the value being added to `r`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `r` is incremented by the value of `rn`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, `node`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element (i.e., `x` must have at least one neighbor), `node` is the next neighbor of `x` in `g[x]`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`, `r` is incremented by `rn`.**
