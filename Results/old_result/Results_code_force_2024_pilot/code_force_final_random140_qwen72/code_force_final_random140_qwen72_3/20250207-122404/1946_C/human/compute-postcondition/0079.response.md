The only objects in the loop head are `u` and `tree.vertices[v].children`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tree.vertices[v].children`. If this list has more than one element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, and `u` is the first child of `v`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, and `u` will be the second child of `v`.

State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the second child of `v`, `stack` now includes `(u, False)` at the top.**
