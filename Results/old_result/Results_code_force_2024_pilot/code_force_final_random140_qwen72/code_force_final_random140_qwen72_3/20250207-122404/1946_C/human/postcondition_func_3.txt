The function `func_4` takes a tree represented by `tree`, an integer `n` indicating the number of vertices, and an integer `k` (1 â‰¤ k < n) representing the number of edges to be removed. It returns the largest integer `x` such that `func_3(tree, n, k, x)` returns `True`. The state of the tree and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.
