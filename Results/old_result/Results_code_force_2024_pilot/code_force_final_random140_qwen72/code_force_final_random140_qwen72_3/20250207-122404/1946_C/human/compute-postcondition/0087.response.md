The code snippet `good_components[v] += good_components[u]` updates the value of `good_components[v]` by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it. 

Given the initial state:
- `tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child.
- `s` is a non-negative integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`.
- `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`.
- `stack` is the list after popping the top element.
- `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value.
- `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value.
- `postorder` is true.

The value of `good_components[v]` is updated to `good_components[v] + good_components[u]`. Since `good_components[v]` initially is `0`, the new value of `good_components[v]` will be `good_components[u]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `good_components[u]` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, `postorder` is true.**
