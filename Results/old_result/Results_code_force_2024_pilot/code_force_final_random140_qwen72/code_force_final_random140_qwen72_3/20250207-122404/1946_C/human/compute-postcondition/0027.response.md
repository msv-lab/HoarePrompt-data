Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element (i.e., `x` must have at least one neighbor). After all iterations of the loop, `c` is the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`, plus 1 (the initial value of `c`). `r` is the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`. The `visited` set will include all nodes that were visited during the loop.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- `c` will be the initial value of 1 plus the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`.
- `r` will be the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.
- The `visited` set will include all nodes that were visited during the loop, starting from the initial set which included `x`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, and the structure of `g` remain unchanged.
