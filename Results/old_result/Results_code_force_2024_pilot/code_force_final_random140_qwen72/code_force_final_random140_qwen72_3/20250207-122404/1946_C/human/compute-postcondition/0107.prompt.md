Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals, `stack` is a list containing a single tuple `(s, False)`, `good_components` is an empty dictionary, `remaining_size` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        good_components[v] = 0
        remaining_size[v] = 1
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    elif postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            good_components[v] += good_components[u]
            if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                good_components[v] += 1
            else:
                remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals, `v` is `s`, and `postorder` is either `False` or `True`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` contains the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is `True`, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components[v]` is the total count of good components (components where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`) and their children's good components, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of the sizes of all components that did not meet the minimum size requirement `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is false, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have `n` children where `n` is the total number of children of vertex `v`. The `stack` now includes `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` at the end of its list, in the order they were appended. If `postorder` is true, `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, plus 1 (the initial value of `remaining_size[v]`). The `stack`, `postorder`, and `tree` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`tree` is a Tree object with `v` as a vertex, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is false, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have `n` children, and `stack` now includes `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` at the top, in the order they were appended. If `postorder` is true, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, plus 1 (the initial value of `remaining_size[v]`). The `stack`, `postorder`, and `tree` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
