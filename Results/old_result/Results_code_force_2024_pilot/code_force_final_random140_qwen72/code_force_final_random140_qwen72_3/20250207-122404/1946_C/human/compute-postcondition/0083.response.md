Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must have `n` children, `stack` now includes `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` at the top, in the order they were appended.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `tree.vertices[v].children` still has `n` children, where `n` is the total number of children of vertex `v`. The `stack` now contains a tuple `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, with these tuples added in the order the children were processed. This means the `stack` will have all the children of `v` appended to it, each with the `False` flag indicating that they are yet to be processed in postorder.
