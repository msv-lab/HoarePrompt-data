Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `c` is 1, `r` is now `rn + 1`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element (i.e., `x` must have at least one neighbor), `node` is not in the `visited` set, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned from the `dfs` function call, and the value of `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is incremented by 1, so `r` is now `rn + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
