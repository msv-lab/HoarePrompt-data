Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, and `postorder` is true.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is now equal to its original value plus `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1. If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to its original value plus `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree.vertices[v].children` has at least two children, `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree.vertices[v].children` has at least three children, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
