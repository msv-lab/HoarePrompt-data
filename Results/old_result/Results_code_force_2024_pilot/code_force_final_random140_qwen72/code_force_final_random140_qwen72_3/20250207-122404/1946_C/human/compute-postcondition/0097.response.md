Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is true, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is updated to `good_components[v] + good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`.** 

The value of `remaining_size[v]` is now the sum of its original value and the value of `remaining_size[u]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
