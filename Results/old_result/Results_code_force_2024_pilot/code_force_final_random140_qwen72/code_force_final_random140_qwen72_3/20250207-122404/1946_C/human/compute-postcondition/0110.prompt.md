You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, s is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, and x is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    good_components = {}
    remaining_size = {}
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            good_components[v] = 0
            remaining_size[v] = 1
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        elif postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                good_components[v] += good_components[u]
                if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                    good_components[v] += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `tree` remains a Tree object representing the original tree structure with vertices and edges. `s` is still the non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is the non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals. `stack` is an empty list, indicating that all vertices have been processed. `good_components` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the tree, and the value is the total count of good components (components where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`) and their children's good components. `remaining_size` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the tree, and the value is the sum of the sizes of all components that did not meet the minimum size requirement `x`, plus 1 for the vertex itself.
    return good_components[s], remaining_size[s]
    #The program returns the total count of good components starting from vertex `s` and the size of the remaining component at vertex `s`. The total count of good components is the sum of all good components (components where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`) and their children's good components, as stored in the `good_components` dictionary. The size of the remaining component at vertex `s` is the sum of the sizes of all components that did not meet the minimum size requirement `x`, plus 1 for the vertex itself, as stored in the `remaining_size` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and a non-negative integer `x` representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components. It returns the total count of good components starting from vertex `s` and the size of the remaining component at vertex `s`. A good component is one where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total count of good components starting from vertex `s` and the size of the remaining component at vertex `s`. The total count of good components is the sum of all good components (components where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`) and their children's good components, as stored in the `good_components` dictionary. The size of the remaining component at vertex `s` is the sum of the sizes of all components that did not meet the minimum size requirement `x`, plus 1 for the vertex itself, as stored in the `remaining_size` dictionary.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
