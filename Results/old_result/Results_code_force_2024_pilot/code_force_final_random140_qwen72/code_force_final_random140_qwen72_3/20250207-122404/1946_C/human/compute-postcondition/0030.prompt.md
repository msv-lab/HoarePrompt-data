You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, where x represents a vertex in the graph g, and y represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges. g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, and visited is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal.
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element (i.e., `x` must have at least one neighbor). After all iterations of the loop, `c` is the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`, plus 1 (the initial value of `c`). `r` is the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`. The `visited` set will include all nodes that were visited during the loop.
    return c, r
    #The program returns `c` and `r`, where `c` is the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`, plus 1 (the initial value of `c`). `r` is the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` is a vertex in the graph `g` and `y` is the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges. It returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` is the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`, plus 1. `r` is the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `c` and `r`, where `c` is the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`, plus 1 (the initial value of `c`). `r` is the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
