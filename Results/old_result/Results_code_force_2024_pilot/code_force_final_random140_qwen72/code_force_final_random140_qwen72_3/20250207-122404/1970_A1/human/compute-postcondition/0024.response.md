The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", forming a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function processes this string and returns a new string `result`. This `result` string is constructed by rearranging the characters from the original string `s` according to the order specified by the third element of each tuple in the `positions` list. The `positions` list is sorted first by the balance (difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses) in ascending order, and then by the index in descending order for tuples with the same balance.

Functionality: **The function accepts a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `result` where the characters are rearranged based on a specific sorting of positions by balance and index.**
