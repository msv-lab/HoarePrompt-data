Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `positions` is a list containing the tuple `(balance, 0, first_char)`, `char` is the second character of `s`, and if `char` is '(', then `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `balance` is -2.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `balance` is 1 if `char` is '(', and -1 if `char` is ')'.
- The code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1.
- If `char` is '(', `balance` was initially 1, so after decrementing, `balance` becomes 0.
- If `char` is ')', `balance` was initially -1, so after decrementing, `balance` becomes -2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
