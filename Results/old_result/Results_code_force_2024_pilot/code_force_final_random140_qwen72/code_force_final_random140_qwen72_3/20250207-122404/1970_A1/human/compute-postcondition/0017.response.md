The value of `balance` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `balance` was either 2 (if `char` is '(') or -2 (if `char` is ')'). Therefore, the new value of `balance` will be 1 if `char` is '(', or -3 if `char` is ')'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `positions` is a list containing the tuples `(balance, 0, first_char)` and `(balance, 1, char)`, `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is '(', then `balance` is 1. If `char` is ')', then `balance` is -3.**
