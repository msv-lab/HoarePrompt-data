#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `n` is the length of `s`. `balance` is 0 because the parentheses sequence is balanced. `positions` is a list containing `n` tuples, each representing the balance, index, and character at each position in the string `s`. The final value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the string `s`.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` which contains the characters from the original string `s` rearranged according to the order specified by the third element of each tuple in the `positions` list. The `positions` list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by index in descending order for the same balance.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It processes the string to generate a new string `result` where the characters are rearranged based on a specific sorting criteria: the characters are first sorted by their balance (the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses encountered up to that point) in ascending order, and for characters with the same balance, they are sorted by their original index in descending order. The function returns this newly arranged string `result`. After the function concludes, `s` remains unchanged, and `result` is the transformed string.
