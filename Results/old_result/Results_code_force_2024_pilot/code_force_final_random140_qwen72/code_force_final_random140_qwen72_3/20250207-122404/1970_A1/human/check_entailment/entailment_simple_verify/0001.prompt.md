You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for (_, _, char) in positions])
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `n` is the length of `s`. `balance` is 0 because the parentheses sequence is balanced. `positions` is a list containing `n` tuples, each representing the balance, index, and character at each position in the string `s`. The final value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the string `s`.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` which contains the characters from the original string `s` rearranged according to the order specified by the third element of each tuple in the `positions` list. The `positions` list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by index in descending order for the same balance.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix at each position in the input string `s`. This is done using a loop where the balance is incremented for an opening parenthesis `'('` and decremented for a closing parenthesis `')'`.

2. **Positions List Construction**: The program constructs a list of tuples `positions`, where each tuple contains the balance, the position, and the character at that position. This is necessary to keep track of the balance and the original position of each character.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `positions` list based on the balance in ascending order and the position in descending order (to break ties). This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `positions` list and joining them together.

5. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `s` using `input().strip()` and calls the function `func_1` to perform the balanced shuffle operation.

6. **Output**: The result of the balanced shuffle operation is printed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required and follows the steps to compute the balanced shuffle of the input string.

### Correctness:
**True**
