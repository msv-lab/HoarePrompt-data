### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix at each position in the input string `s`.
   - For each character in the string, if it is an opening parenthesis `'('`, the balance is incremented by 1. If it is a closing parenthesis `')'`, the balance is decremented by 1.
   - This step is crucial for determining the balance at each position, which is used in the sorting criteria.

2. **Positions List Construction**:
   - The program constructs a list of tuples `positions`, where each tuple contains three elements: the balance, the position, and the character at that position.
   - This list is essential for keeping track of the balance and the original position of each character, which are used in the sorting process.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `positions` list based on two criteria:
     - The balance in ascending order.
     - For characters with the same balance, the position in descending order.
   - This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, characters with the same balance are ordered by their original position in reverse order, which is a key part of the problem's requirements.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `positions` list and joining them together.
   - This step ensures that the final string is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` using `input().strip()` and calls the function `func_1` to perform the balanced shuffle operation.
   - This step is straightforward and correctly handles the input.

6. **Output**:
   - The result of the balanced shuffle operation is printed.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output for the given input.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the balance, constructs the positions list, sorts it according to the specified criteria, and constructs the result string. The input and output handling are also correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
