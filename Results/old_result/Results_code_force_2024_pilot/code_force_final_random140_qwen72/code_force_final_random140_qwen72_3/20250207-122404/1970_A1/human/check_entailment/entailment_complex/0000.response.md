Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace, ensuring that the input string `s` is clean and ready for processing.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The program iterates over the string `s` and calculates the balance of the parentheses at each position. This is done correctly by incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis `)`.

3. **Positions List Construction**: The program constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the balance, the original index, and the character at that position. This list is built correctly and efficiently.

4. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `positions` list based on the balance in ascending order and the index in descending order for the same balance. This sorting logic is implemented using a lambda function in the `sort` method, which is correct according to the problem's requirements.

5. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `positions` list. This step is also correct and ensures that the characters are rearranged as required.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result of the `func_1` function, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

Given that all steps in the program align with the problem's requirements and the logic is implemented correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
