The code snippet sorts the `positions` list based on the balance value (`x[0]`) in ascending order. For positions with the same balance value, it sorts them based on the index (`x[1]`) in descending order.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `balance` is 0.
- `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, each containing the balance, index, and character at each position in `s`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

After executing the code:
- The `positions` list is sorted according to the specified key.
- The `positions` list now contains the same tuples, but they are ordered first by the balance value in ascending order and then by the index in descending order for the same balance value.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `balance`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance` is 0, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples sorted by balance in ascending order and by index in descending order for the same balance, `i` is `n-1`.**
