Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It computes the balance of each prefix, sorts the characters based on the specified criteria (balance in ascending order and position in descending order for ties), and constructs the resulting shuffled sequence. The implementation handles the input and output as required, and the logic aligns with the steps outlined in the problem description.
