### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix at each position in the input string `s`. This is done using a loop where the balance is incremented for an opening parenthesis `'('` and decremented for a closing parenthesis `')'`.

2. **Positions List Construction**: The program constructs a list of tuples `positions`, where each tuple contains the balance, the position, and the character at that position. This is necessary to keep track of the balance and the original position of each character.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `positions` list based on the balance in ascending order and the position in descending order (to break ties). This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `positions` list and joining them together.

5. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `s` using `input().strip()` and calls the function `func_1` to perform the balanced shuffle operation.

6. **Output**: The result of the balanced shuffle operation is printed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required and follows the steps to compute the balanced shuffle of the input string.

### Correctness:
**True**
