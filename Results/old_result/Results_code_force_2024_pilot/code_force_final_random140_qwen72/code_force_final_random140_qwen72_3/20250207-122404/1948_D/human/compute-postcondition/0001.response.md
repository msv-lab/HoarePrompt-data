Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0.** 

The variable `count` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
