#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of the strings over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `k` is `n - j`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and `count` is either 0 or the maximum number of consecutive positions where the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` were met without breaking the sequence. If `count` ever reaches `j`, the program prints `j * 2` and returns, otherwise, the loop completes without printing anything.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but operates on a global string `s` and an integer `n` (not explicitly provided in the function signature). It checks for patterns in the string `s` by comparing characters separated by a distance `j`, starting from the middle of the string and moving towards the beginning. If a pattern of consecutive matching or wildcard (`?`) characters of length `j` is found, it prints `j * 2` and exits. If no such pattern is found after all iterations, the function returns 0. The function modifies a local variable `count` to track the length of the current pattern being checked, but does not modify the input string `s` or the integer `n`.
