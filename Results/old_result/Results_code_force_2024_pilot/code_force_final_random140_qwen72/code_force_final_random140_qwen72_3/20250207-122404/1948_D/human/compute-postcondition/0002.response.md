To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for k in range(0, n - j):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `k`, `n`, and `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(0, n - j)` contains at least one value. This means `n - j` must be greater than 0.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `s` is a string of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `j` is `n // 2`.
   - `count` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n - j` must be greater than 0.
   - Given `j = n // 2`, this means `n - (n // 2) > 0`.
   - Simplifying, `n / 2 > 0`, which is always true for `n >= 2`.

5. **Initial Values for Loop Variables:**
   - `k` will start at 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `j` is `n // 2`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `k` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `j` is `n // 2`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `s`, and `count`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`**
