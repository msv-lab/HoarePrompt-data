Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing all question marks with lowercase letters. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. **Global Variables**: The function `func_1` relies on global variables `s` and `n`, which are not passed as parameters. This is generally a bad practice and can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in more complex programs or when the function is reused in different contexts.

2. **Loop Initialization**: The loop `for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1)` correctly starts from the largest possible half-length of a tandem repeat and decreases. This is a good approach to find the maximum length efficiently.

3. **Pattern Matching**: The inner loop `for k in range(0, n - j)` checks for patterns of length `j` by comparing characters at positions `k` and `k + j`. The condition `if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` correctly identifies matches or wildcards. However, the logic for updating `count` and printing the result is flawed.

4. **Count Logic**: The variable `count` is used to track the length of the current pattern being checked. However, the condition `if count == j` should actually be `if count == j * 2` because we are looking for a tandem repeat of length `2 * j`. The current implementation will incorrectly print `j * 2` when `count` reaches `j`, which is not the correct length of the tandem repeat.

5. **Return Value**: The function `func_1` should return the maximum length of the tandem repeat, but it currently prints the result and returns nothing. This makes it difficult to use the function in a larger context where the result needs to be used further.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle the case where no tandem repeat is found correctly. It should return 0 in such cases, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
