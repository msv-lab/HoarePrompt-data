Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **String Conversion**: The input string `s` is converted to a list of characters. This is necessary because strings in Python are immutable, and converting to a list allows for easier manipulation.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called within the loop for each test case. However, there is a potential issue here: the variable `n` (length of the string) is not passed to `func_1()`, which means `func_1()` does not have access to `n`. This will cause an error when `func_1()` tries to use `n`.

4. **Tandem Repeat Check**: The function `func_1()` attempts to find the longest tandem repeat by iterating over possible lengths of the tandem repeat from `n // 2` down to 1. For each possible length `j`, it checks if the substring from `k` to `k + j` matches the substring from `k + j` to `k + 2*j`.

5. **Question Mark Handling**: The program correctly handles question marks (`?`) by treating them as wildcards that can match any character. If either character in the comparison is a question mark, or if the characters are already equal, the count is incremented.

6. **Counting and Printing**: If the count reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and the program prints `count * 2` and returns. If no tandem repeat is found, the function returns 0.

7. **Return Value**: The function `func_1()` should return the result, but the current implementation directly prints the result and returns from the function. This is not ideal, as it makes the function less modular and harder to test. However, for the given problem, it works.

8. **Scope Issue**: The variable `n` is defined in the outer scope but used inside `func_1()`. This is a potential issue because `func_1()` should ideally take `n` as a parameter to avoid scope issues.

Given these points, the program has a few issues that need to be addressed, primarily the scope issue and the lack of a return value from `func_1()`. However, the logic for finding the longest tandem repeat is correct.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issues, the program should be modified as follows:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    result = func_1(s, n)
    print(result)

def func_1(s, n):
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                return count * 2
    return 0
```

This version of the program correctly passes the length `n` to `func_1()` and ensures that the result is returned and printed outside the function.
