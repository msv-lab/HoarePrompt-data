The function `func_1` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the context provided, it seems to operate on a string `s` and an integer `t`, where `t` is within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` is a string of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The function modifies a variable `count` based on certain conditions involving the string `s` and an index `k`. Here's the summarized functionality:

Functionality: **The function operates on a string `s` and an integer `t`, modifying a variable `count` based on the characters in `s` and an index `k`. It may set `count` to 0, increment `count` by 1 under specific conditions, or return the value of `count` depending on the cases described. In some cases, the function does not return any value.**

This description captures the essence of the function's behavior without delving into the internal operations or variable initialization details.
