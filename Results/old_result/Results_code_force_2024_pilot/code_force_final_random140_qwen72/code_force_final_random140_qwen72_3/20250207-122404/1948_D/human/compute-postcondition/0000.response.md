To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is initialized to `n // 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0 (exclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must start at a value greater than 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: Since `j` starts at `n // 2`, `n` must be at least 2 for `j` to be greater than 0 initially.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2, and `j` is initialized to `n // 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`**
