Output State: **The program returns 0.** 

This means that regardless of the conditions checked within the loop (whether `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]`), and the value of `count` (which could be 0 or the maximum number of consecutive positions meeting these conditions), the program ultimately returns 0. No other values or actions (like printing) are performed as part of the return statement.
