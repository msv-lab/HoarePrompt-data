Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, the current value of `count` is equal to `j`.**
