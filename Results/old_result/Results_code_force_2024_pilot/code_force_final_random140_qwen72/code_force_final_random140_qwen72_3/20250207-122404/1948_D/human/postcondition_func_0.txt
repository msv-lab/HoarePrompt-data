The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but operates on a global string `s` and an integer `n` (not explicitly provided in the function signature). It checks for patterns in the string `s` by comparing characters separated by a distance `j`, starting from the middle of the string and moving towards the beginning. If a pattern of consecutive matching or wildcard (`?`) characters of length `j` is found, it prints `j * 2` and exits. If no such pattern is found after all iterations, the function returns 0. The function modifies a local variable `count` to track the length of the current pattern being checked, but does not modify the input string `s` or the integer `n`.
