Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of the strings over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is `n - j - 1`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`. The value of `count` will depend on the conditions inside the loop. If `count` reaches `j` at any point during the loop execution, the program prints `j * 2` and returns, terminating the loop. Otherwise, after the final iteration, `count` will be the number of consecutive positions where the conditions `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` were met, up to a maximum of `j - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `k` is `n - j`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `count` is 0. The loop has completed its iterations without `count` ever reaching `j`, so no value is printed, and the program does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `k` is `n - j`, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `count` is either 0 or the maximum number of consecutive positions where the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` were met without breaking the sequence. If `count` ever reaches `j`, the program prints `j * 2` and returns, otherwise, the loop completes without printing anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
