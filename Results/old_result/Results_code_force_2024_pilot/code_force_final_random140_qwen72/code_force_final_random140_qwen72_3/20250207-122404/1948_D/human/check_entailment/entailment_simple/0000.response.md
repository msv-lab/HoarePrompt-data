Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters. Let's break down the logic and check if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` is called for each test case. Inside `func_1`:
   - It iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from `n // 2` down to `1`. This is a good approach because the largest possible tandem repeat would be half the length of the string.
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks if there exists a substring of length `2*j` that can form a tandem repeat by comparing characters at positions `k` and `k + j`.
   - If both characters are question marks or equal, it increments a counter `count`. If the counter reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and it prints `2*j` and returns.
   - If no tandem repeat is found for any length, it returns `0`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string consists entirely of question marks, the program should still find the maximum possible tandem repeat. The logic correctly handles this by checking all possible lengths.
   - If the string has no question marks but still forms a tandem repeat, the program should detect it. The logic correctly checks for this by comparing characters directly.

4. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum length of a tandem repeat by checking all possible lengths from `n // 2` down to `1`.
   - The use of the `count` variable ensures that it only prints the length of a valid tandem repeat when the conditions are met.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case, either the length of the longest tandem repeat or `0` if no tandem repeat can be formed.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
