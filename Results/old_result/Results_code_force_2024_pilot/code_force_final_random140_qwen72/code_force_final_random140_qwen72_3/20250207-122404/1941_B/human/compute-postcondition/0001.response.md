The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `answers`. This means that the list `answers` now includes one additional element, which is the string 'YES'. The initial state specifies that `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, and the function `func_2(inputarray)` returns True. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns True, `answers` contains one more element, which is the string 'YES'.**
