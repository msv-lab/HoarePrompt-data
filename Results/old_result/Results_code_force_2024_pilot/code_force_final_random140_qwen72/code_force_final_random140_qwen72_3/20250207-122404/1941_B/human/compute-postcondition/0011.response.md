Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 1. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `highestNumber` is -1. `highestIndex` is 1. `elementIndex` is 1. The current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 1) to `highestIndex`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
