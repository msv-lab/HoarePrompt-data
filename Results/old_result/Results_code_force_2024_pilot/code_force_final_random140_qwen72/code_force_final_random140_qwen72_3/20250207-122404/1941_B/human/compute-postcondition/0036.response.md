Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 2. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `highestNumber` is -1. `highestIndex` is -1. `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`. `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code `highestIndex = -1` reassigns the value of `highestIndex` to -1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The initial state is updated to reflect the new value of `highestIndex`.
