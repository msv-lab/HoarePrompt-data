Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 1. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`. `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`.
- During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.
- If it is, `highestNumber` is updated to the current element, and `highestIndex` is updated to the current index.
- After all iterations, `highestNumber` will hold the highest value found in the specified range of `inputarray`, and `highestIndex` will hold the index of that highest value.
