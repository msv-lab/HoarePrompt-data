Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 1. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `elementIndex` is 2. `highestIndex` is 2. `highestNumber` is equal to `inputarray[2]`.** 

Explanation: The variable `highestNumber` is assigned the value of the element at index 2 of the list `inputarray`. All other variables remain unchanged.
