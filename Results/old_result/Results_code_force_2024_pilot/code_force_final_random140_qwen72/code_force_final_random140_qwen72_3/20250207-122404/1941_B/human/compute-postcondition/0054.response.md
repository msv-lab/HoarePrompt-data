Output State: **The program returns nothing, but the final state includes `inputarray` as a list of non-negative integers with `length` at least 3, `elementIndex` set to `length - 1`, `func_2(inputarray)` returning `False`, `loop_counter` being 2, `highestNumber` as the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2` (which is less than 0), `highestIndex` as the index of `highestNumber`, `newArray` as the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `func_2(newArray)` also returning `False`, and `answers` containing one element, which is 'NO'.**
