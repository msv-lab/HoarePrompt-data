The only objects in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `elementIndex` being within the range from 1 to `length - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 2, and `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.

Therefore, for the next iteration:
- `elementIndex` is incremented to 3.
- `length` remains the same (at least 3).

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 1. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `elementIndex` is 3. If `inputarray[3]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is 3 and `highestNumber` is equal to `inputarray[3]`.**
