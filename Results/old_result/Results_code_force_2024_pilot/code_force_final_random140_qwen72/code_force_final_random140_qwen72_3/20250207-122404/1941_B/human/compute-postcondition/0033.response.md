The only variable in the loop head is `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `loop_counter` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `loop_counter` must not be 100. Since `loop_counter` is 2, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 2. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`. `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`. `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0. `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`. `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**
