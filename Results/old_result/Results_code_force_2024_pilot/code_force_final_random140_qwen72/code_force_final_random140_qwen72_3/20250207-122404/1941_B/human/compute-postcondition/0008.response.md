Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1.**

The code initializes the variable `highestIndex` to -1. This does not affect any of the other variables, so their values remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `highestIndex`.
