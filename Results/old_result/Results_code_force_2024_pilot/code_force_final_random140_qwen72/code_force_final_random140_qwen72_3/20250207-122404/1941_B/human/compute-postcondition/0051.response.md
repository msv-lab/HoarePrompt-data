Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2` (i.e., the second element to the second-to-last element).
- During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`. If it is, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are updated to the current element and its index, respectively.
- After the loop completes, `highestNumber` will hold the maximum value found in the specified range of `inputarray`, and `highestIndex` will hold the index of that maximum value.
- The variables `elementIndex` will be `length - 1` after the loop finishes, indicating the last index checked.
- The variables `func_2(inputarray)`, `loop_counter`, and `newArray` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
