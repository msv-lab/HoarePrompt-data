Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is the length of `inputarray` (at least 3), `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 3, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `highestIndex` to -1, overriding its previous value which was the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
