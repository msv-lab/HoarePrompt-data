Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is the length of `inputarray` (at least 3), `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 3, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`, and `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `length = len(inputarray)` updates the value of `length` to the actual length of the `inputarray`. Since the initial state specifies that `length` is at least 3, the new value of `length` is also at least 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
