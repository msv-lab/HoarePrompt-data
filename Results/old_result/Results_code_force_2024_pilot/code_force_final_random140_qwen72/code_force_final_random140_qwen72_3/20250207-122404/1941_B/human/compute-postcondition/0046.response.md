Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, `highestNumber` remains as the maximum of `inputarray[1]` and the initial `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` remains as 1 or -1 depending on whether `inputarray[1]` was greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`.***
