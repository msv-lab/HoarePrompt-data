Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is 2.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list.
- `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`.
- `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same output regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, or `new_all`.

Output: **YES**
