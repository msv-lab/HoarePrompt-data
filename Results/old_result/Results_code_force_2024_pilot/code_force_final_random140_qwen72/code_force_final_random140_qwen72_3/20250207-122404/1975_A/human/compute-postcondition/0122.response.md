Postcondition: **_ is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-1`. If `check_all` is `True`, then all consecutive elements in `a` are in increasing order, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating the conditions as described. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. Additionally, if any element in `a` at index `i-1` is greater than the element at index `i` for any `i` from 1 to `n-1`, then `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from that index `i` to the end. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. The loop will break if `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]` and either `check_all` or `new_all` is `False`, or if both are `True`. If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations.**
