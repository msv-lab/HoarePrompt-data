To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `_` is incremented by 1 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is `True`.
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `2` to the end.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
- Regardless of whether `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True` or not, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- `n` must still be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is `True`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `2` to the end, and `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.**
