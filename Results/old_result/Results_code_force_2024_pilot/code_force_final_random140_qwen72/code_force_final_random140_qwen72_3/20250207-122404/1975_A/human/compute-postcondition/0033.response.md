The code snippet updates the value of `check_all` based on the condition that the first element of the list `a` is greater than all elements in the list `new`. The list `new` contains elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list.

Let's break down the impact:

- `check_all` is updated to a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is greater than every element in `new`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, and `new_all`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, and `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.**
