Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than all elements in the sublist `new`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in the sublist `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end, and either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`**.
