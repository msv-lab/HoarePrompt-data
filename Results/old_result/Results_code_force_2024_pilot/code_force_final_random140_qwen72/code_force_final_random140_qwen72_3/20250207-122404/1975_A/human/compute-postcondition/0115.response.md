To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is incremented by 1 (though this doesn't affect the print statement).
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 3.
   - `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` if it was true in the previous iteration.
   - `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not influence the print statement directly. They are used to set up the context but do not change the output of the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
