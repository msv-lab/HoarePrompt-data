Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `check_all` is assigned the result of the expression `all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`.
- This expression checks if the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is greater than every element in the list `new`.
- The list `new` contains elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list.
- The value of `check_all` will be `True` if `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `new`, and `False` otherwise.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
