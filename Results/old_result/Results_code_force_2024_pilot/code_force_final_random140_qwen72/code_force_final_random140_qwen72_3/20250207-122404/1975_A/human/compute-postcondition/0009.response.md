Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `False` because not all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.**
