To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. `_` is incremented by 1. This doesn't affect the print statement directly.
2. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000. This is a parameter but not directly relevant to the print statement.
3. `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50. This is also a parameter and not directly relevant to the print statement.
4. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. This list is used in the conditions.
5. `i` is set to 2.
6. `n` must be at least 2, which is already satisfied since `n` is between 2 and 50.
7. If `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) is greater than `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`), `check_all` is set to `True`.
8. `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
9. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
10. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
11. Otherwise, either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will execute if the conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement are not met. Specifically, the print statement will execute if either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Since the conditions for `check_all` and `new_all` are not explicitly stated to be `True`, it is reasonable to assume that at least one of them is `False`, leading to the execution of the `print('NO')` statement.

Output: **NO**
