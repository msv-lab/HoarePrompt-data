Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (though this doesn't affect the print statement).
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True`, indicating that `a[0]` is greater than all elements in the sublist `new`.
- `new_all` is `True`, indicating that all elements in the sublist `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, meaning `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end, which means `new` is `a[1:]`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
