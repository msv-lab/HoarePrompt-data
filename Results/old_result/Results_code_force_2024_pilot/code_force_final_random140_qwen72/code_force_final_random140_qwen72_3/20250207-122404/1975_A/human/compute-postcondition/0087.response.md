Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is incremented by 1 (this doesn't affect the print statement).
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if all consecutive elements in `a` are in increasing order, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating the conditions as described.
- If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is `n-1` and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('YES')` is a simple statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables and their values, but it does not influence the content of the print statement directly.
- The print statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, or `new_all`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
