To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list.
   - `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`.
   - `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

2. **Context:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed after the conditions described in the initial state have been set up.
   - The statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state; it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
