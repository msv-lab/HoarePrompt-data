Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. Additionally, either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
