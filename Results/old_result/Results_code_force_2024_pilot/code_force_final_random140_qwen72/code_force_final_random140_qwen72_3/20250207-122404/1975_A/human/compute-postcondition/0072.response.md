The code snippet `new = a[i:]` assigns to `new` a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to the end of the list. This means `new` will contain all elements of `a` starting from the third element (index 2) onwards.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be at least 3
- If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is `True`
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `2` to the end
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`

After executing the code snippet:
- `new` is updated to `a[3:]` (i.e., `a[i:]` where `i` is 3)

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, if `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is `True`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.**
