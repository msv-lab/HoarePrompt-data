Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `False` because the elements in `a` are not in strictly increasing order, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i` to the end (which is now `a[1:]`), `check_all` indicates whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.**
