The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.

- `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` remains a new input integer between 2 and 50.
- `a` is now a list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
