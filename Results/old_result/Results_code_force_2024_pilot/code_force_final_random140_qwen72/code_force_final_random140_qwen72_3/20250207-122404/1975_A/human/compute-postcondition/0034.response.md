Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, and `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. `new_all` is now updated to reflect whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.**
