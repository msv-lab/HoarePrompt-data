The code snippet provided updates the variable `check_all` based on a condition involving the elements of the list `a` and its sublist `new`. Let's break down the impact:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (unchanged from the initial state).
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (unchanged).
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 2 (unchanged).
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end (unchanged).

The code snippet:
```python
check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
```
- This line checks if every element in the sublist `new` is less than the first element of the list `a`.
- `check_all` will be `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`.
- `check_all` will be `False` if any element in `new` is not less than `a[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.**
