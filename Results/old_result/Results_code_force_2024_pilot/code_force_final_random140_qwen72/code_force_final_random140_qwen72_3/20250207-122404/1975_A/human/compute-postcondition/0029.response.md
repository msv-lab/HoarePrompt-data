Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, and `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is True and `new_all` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
