Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `_` is equal to `t`, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, and `a` is a list of integers read from the input. For each iteration, if `check_all` is `True`, it means all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, and 'YES' is printed. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop checks each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If at any point `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is set to the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, and `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`, 'YES' is printed and the loop breaks. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the loop breaks. If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations:
- The loop variable `_` has been incremented `t` times, meaning the loop has run `t` times.
- For each iteration, the program reads a new `n` and a new list `a`.
- It checks if the list `a` is in strictly increasing order. If so, it prints 'YES'.
- If not, it looks for a point where the list is not in increasing order and checks if the remaining part of the list meets certain conditions. If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- After all iterations, the loop completes, and the final state reflects that all `t` iterations have been processed.
