Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (though this doesn't affect the print statement).
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than all elements in the sublist `new`, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in the sublist `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end.
- Either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the logic:

1. `i` is 1, so `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]` and `a[i]` is `a[1]`.
2. `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`.
3. `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, i.e., `new = a[1:]`.
4. `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `new`, but since `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]` (which is the first element of `new`), `check_all` could still be `True` if `a[0]` is greater than all other elements in `new`.
5. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. Since `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, and `new` starts with `a[1]`, `new` cannot be in non-decreasing order if `a[1]` is followed by any element smaller than `a[1]`.

Given that either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and since `a[0] > a[1]`, it implies that `new_all` is `False` because the sublist `new` cannot be in non-decreasing order if the first element of `new` is greater than the next element.

Therefore, the condition for printing 'NO' is met.

Output: **NO**
