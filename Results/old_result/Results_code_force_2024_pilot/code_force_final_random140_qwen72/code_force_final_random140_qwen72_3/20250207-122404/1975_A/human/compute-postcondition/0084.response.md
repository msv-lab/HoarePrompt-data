The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer between 2 and 50. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` and `new_all` are boolean values indicating the conditions as described, and if `check_all` is `False`, `i` is `n-1` and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.**
