To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is incremented by 1. This doesn't affect the print statement directly.
2. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000. This is likely the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly impact the current print statement.
3. `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50. This is the length of the list `a`.
4. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
5. `i` is 2.
6. `n` must be at least 2, which is already satisfied since `n` is between 2 and 50.
7. If `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) is greater than `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`), `check_all` is `True`.
8. `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
9. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
10. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
11. Otherwise, either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will execute if both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`.

Let's break down the conditions:
- `check_all` is `True` if `a[1] > a[2]`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` (which is `a[2:]`) are in non-decreasing order.

If both conditions are met, the print statement will execute and print 'YES'. If either condition is not met, the print statement will not execute.

Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we cannot definitively say whether the conditions will be met. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output 'YES' if both conditions are satisfied.

Output: **YES (if both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`)**
