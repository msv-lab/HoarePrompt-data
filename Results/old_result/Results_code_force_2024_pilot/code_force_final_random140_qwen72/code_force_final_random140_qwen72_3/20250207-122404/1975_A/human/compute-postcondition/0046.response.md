Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i` to the end if at any point during the loop, `a[i - 1]` was greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` indicates whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `check_all` based on whether all elements in the list `a` are in strictly increasing order.
- The list comprehension checks each pair of consecutive elements in `a` (from index 1 to `n-1`) to see if the previous element is less than the current element.
- If all pairs satisfy this condition, `check_all` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
