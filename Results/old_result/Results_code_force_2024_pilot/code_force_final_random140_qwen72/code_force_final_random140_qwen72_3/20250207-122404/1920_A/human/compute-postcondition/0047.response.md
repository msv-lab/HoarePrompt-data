Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3 and must have at least one element, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `i` is between `start` and `end` inclusive, `count_num` is set to 1.***
