The code `num.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `num` initially contains `[v]`, after executing the code, `num` will contain `[v, v]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `t` is the new input integer, `v` is the new input integer, `i` is 2, `start` remains unchanged unless `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, in which case `start` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 2 and `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000. `num` is a list containing `[v, v]`.**
