### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Constraints Parsing:**
   - The function `func_7()` correctly reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to \(10^9\) to represent the initial bounds for the integer `k`.
   - It reads each constraint and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
     - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of the current `start` and `x`.
     - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of the current `end` and `x`.
     - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), it appends `x` to the list `num`.

2. **Range Calculation:**
   - After processing all constraints, the function calculates the range of valid `k` values as `end - start + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the number of invalid values (those in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0, which is correct because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - The function correctly handles the case where there are no invalid values within the range.

4. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic for updating `start` and `end` is correct and ensures that the final range is the intersection of all constraints.
   - The logic for counting and subtracting invalid values is also correct.

5. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_7()`. It correctly states that the function processes the constraints to determine the range `[start, end]` and counts the invalid values within this range.
   - The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of invalid values, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
