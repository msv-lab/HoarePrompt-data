Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration, `count_num` is 0.**
