Output State: **The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Otherwise, the program returns 0.**

Here's a breakdown:
- `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or -1 if no such `v` is found.
- `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or 1000000000 if no such `v` is found.
- `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3.
- `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive.
- The program calculates `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the program returns 0.
