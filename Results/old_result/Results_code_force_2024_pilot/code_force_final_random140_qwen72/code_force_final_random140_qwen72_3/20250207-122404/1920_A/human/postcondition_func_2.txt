The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and `sym`, a string used as a separator. It returns a single string where each element of `arr` is converted to a string and concatenated together, separated by `sym`. The resulting string does not have a trailing `sym`.
