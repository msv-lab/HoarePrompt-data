#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :

        #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `True`, the function returns the integer value 1. If `isOne` is `False`, the function prompts the user to enter an integer and returns that integer. After the function concludes, the program will have either returned 1 or the integer value entered by the user.

def func_2(space, to_int):

        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean indicating whether to split the input by spaces, `to_int` is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers, `line` is the input string provided by the user. If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by spaces. If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding item in `items` to an integer. `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `line` by spaces if `space` is `True`, or a list of individual characters from `line` if `space` is `False`. Since `to_int` is `True`, the conversion to integers is performed.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of strings. If `space` is `True`, `items` contains the substrings obtained by splitting `line` by spaces. If `space` is `False`, `items` contains individual characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is `False`, no conversion to integers is performed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. It reads a line of input from the user. If `space` is `True`, it splits the input line into a list of substrings based on spaces. If `space` is `False`, it converts the input line into a list of individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, it converts each item in the resulting list to an integer and returns the list of integers. If `to_int` is `False`, it returns the list of substrings or characters without any conversion.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and sym is a string used as a separator.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of elements that can be converted to strings, `sym` is a string used as a separator, `string` is now equal to the concatenation of each element in `arr` converted to a string, followed by `sym`, with no trailing `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of each element in `arr` converted to a string, followed by `sym`, with no trailing `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and `sym`, a string used as a separator. It returns a single string where each element of `arr` is converted to a string and concatenated together, separated by `sym`. The resulting string does not have a trailing `sym`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, and substring is a string that may or may not be present in string.

    #State: `string` is a string, `substring` is a string that is present in `string`, `indices` is a list containing all the indices of `substring` in `string`, and `index` is `-1`.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list containing all the indices of `substring` in `string`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. It returns a list of all the starting indices where `substring` is found within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns an empty list. After the function concludes, the original `string` and `substring` remain unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where each index corresponds to the position in the list `arr` where the value is equal to `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It returns a list of indices where the value in `arr` is equal to `element`. If no such elements exist, it returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists where each sublist contains at least `index + 1` elements, index is a non-negative integer, and value is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of lists, `index` is a non-negative integer, `value` is an integer, and the loop has checked every sublist in `arr` for the condition `subArray[index] == value`. If any sublist meets this condition, it was returned immediately. If no sublist in `arr` has an element at position `index` that equals `value`, the loop completes without returning any sublist.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no sublist in `arr` has an element at position `index` that equals `value`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes a list of lists `arr`, a non-negative integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find the first sublist where the element at position `index` is equal to `value`. If such a sublist is found, it is returned. If no sublist meets this condition, the function returns `None`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. start and end are integers initialized to -1 and 1000000000 respectively. num is an initially empty list.

    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Otherwise, the program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of inputs and processes them to determine a range defined by `start` and `end`. It also collects specific values into a list `num`. After processing, the function calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`. It then returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of these elements, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0.
