The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100). At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is either `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, or remains -1 otherwise, `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains an empty list, `i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer.**
