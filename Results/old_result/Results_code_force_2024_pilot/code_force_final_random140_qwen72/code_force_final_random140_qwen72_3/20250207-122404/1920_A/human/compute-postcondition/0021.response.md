Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the new `v`, `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to the new `v` if `end` was greater than the new `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value of the new `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains an empty list, `i` is 1, `t` is the new input integer, and `v` is the new input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `start` is updated to the new value of `v`.
- The values of `n`, `end`, `num`, `i`, `t`, and `v` remain as described in the initial state.
