### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`. This function is called with `isOne=False`, so it correctly reads an integer from the input.
   - For each test case, `func_7()` is called to process the constraints and compute the number of valid integers `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - In `func_7()`, the function initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000. These represent the lower and upper bounds of the range for `k`.
   - The function reads `n` constraints and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (`k >= x`), `start` is updated to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (`k <= x`), `end` is updated to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (`k != x`), the value `x` is added to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - After processing all constraints, the function counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - The function then calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid values in `num`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0, indicating no valid integers.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in the list `ans` and printed one by one.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the constraints as described in the problem statement.
- The logic for updating `start` and `end` and counting valid integers is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
- The function `func_7()` correctly computes the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
