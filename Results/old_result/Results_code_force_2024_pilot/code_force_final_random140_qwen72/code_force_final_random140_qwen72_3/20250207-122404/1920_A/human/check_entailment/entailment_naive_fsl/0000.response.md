Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` are initialized to appropriate values (`-1` and `1000000000` respectively) to handle the constraints of the problem.
2. **Reading Constraints**: The program reads `n` constraints and processes each one:
   - For type 1 constraints (k must be greater than or equal to some integer x), it updates `start` to the maximum value of `v`.
   - For type 2 constraints (k must be less than or equal to some integer x), it updates `end` to the minimum value of `v`.
   - For type 3 constraints (k must be not equal to some integer x), it appends `v` to the `num` list.
3. **Counting Valid Integers**: After processing all constraints, the program counts the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` that are not in the `num` list. This is done by iterating through the `num` list and checking if each value falls within the range `[start, end]`.
4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start <= end`, otherwise it returns `0`.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
