Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_7` reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates over each constraint, reading the type `t` and the value `v`.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), it updates the `start` variable to the maximum value encountered.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), it updates the `end` variable to the minimum value encountered.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), it appends the value `x` to the `num` list.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - It initializes `count_num` to zero, which will store the number of invalid values within the range `[start, end]`.
   - It iterates over the `num` list and increments `count_num` for each value that lies within the range `[start, end]`.
   - Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, ensuring that the result is non-negative by checking if `start <= end`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0, which is the correct behavior since no integer can satisfy the constraints in this case.

The program does not use any of the other functions (`func_1` to `func_6`) defined in the code, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution for the given problem. The core logic in `func_7` is sufficient and correct for solving the problem.
