Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `t` is the new input integer, `v` is the new input integer, `i` is 1. If `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`, and `num` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000, and `num` remains an empty list. `start` remains unchanged.***
