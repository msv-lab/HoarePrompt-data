You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. start and end are integers initialized to -1 and 1000000000 respectively. num is an initially empty list.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3, `i` is the last element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration. `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Otherwise, the program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Otherwise, the program returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
