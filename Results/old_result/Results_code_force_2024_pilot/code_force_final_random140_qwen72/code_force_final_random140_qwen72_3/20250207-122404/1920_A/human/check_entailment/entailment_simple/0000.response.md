### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` using `func_1()`. This function is called with `isOne` set to `False`, so it correctly reads an integer from the input.
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000. It also initializes an empty list `num` to store the values of `v` for constraints of type 3.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - The program processes each constraint by reading `t` and `v` from the input.
   - If `t` is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to `v`), it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - If `t` is 2 (k must be less than or equal to `v`), it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
   - If `t` is 3 (k must not be equal to `v`), it appends `v` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - The program initializes `count_num` to 0 and iterates over the list `num` to count how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - It then calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints as `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0, indicating no valid integers.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result of each test case to the list `ans` and prints each result after processing all test cases.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the constraints as described in the problem statement.
- It correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
- The logic for handling constraints of type 1, 2, and 3 is implemented correctly.
- The final calculation of the number of valid integers is also correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
