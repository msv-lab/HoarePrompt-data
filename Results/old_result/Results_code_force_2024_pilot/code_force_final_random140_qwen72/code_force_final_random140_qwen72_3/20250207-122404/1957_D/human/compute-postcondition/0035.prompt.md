Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `i` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is the cumulative XOR of the first 31 elements in `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if cur >> j & 1:
        suf[j][1] += 1
    else:
        suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]` except for the sublist at index `j` which is `[0, 1]` if the least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> j & 1`) is 1, or `[1, 0]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, `i` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is the cumulative XOR of the first 31 elements in `arr`, and `j` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]` except for the sublist at index 1 which is `[0, 2]` if the least significant bit of `cur` is 1, or `[2, 0]` if the least significant bit of `cur` is 0, `i` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is the cumulative XOR of the first 31 elements in `arr`, and `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]` except for the sublist at index 1 which is `[0, 2]` if the least significant bit of `cur` is 1, or `[2, 0]` if the least significant bit of `cur` is 0, and the sublist at index 2 which is `[0, 1]` if the third least significant bit of `cur` is 1, or `[1, 0]` if the third least significant bit of `cur` is 0, `i` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is the cumulative XOR of the first 31 elements in `arr`, and `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
