The value `v ^ prefix[-1]` is appended to the list `prefix`. This means that `prefix` now has one more element than before, and this new element is the result of the XOR operation between `v` and the last element of `prefix`.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least two elements, `prefix` has an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`**
