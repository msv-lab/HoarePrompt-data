The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the constant `32`, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `32`. If `j` is less than `32`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 1**
