Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 2, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1, `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1.
- Since `j` is 2, `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1.
- The condition `c >> j & 1` is true, which means `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
