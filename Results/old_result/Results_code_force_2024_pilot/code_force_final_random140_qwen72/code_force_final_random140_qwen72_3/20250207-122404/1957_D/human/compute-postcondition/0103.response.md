The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range value `32`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range value. The range value is 32, which means the loop will execute 32 times starting from 0 up to 31. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` must start at 0.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 0**
