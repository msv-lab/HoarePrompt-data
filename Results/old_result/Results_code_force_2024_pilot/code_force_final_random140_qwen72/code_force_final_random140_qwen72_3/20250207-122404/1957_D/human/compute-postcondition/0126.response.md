Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[y.bit_length() - 1][0] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][0] + pre[y.bit_length() - 1][1] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 31**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `y.bit_length() - 1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `y`, `ans`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is used in the expression for `ans`, which now depends on `y.bit_length() - 1`.
