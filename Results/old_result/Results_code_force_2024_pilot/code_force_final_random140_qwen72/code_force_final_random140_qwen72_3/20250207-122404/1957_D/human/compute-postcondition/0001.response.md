The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `arr`.

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
