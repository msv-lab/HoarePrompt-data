To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects directly involved in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `v` and the list `arr`.

1. **Variable `v`**: This variable will take on the values of elements in `arr` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values from `arr` automatically.

2. **List `arr`**: For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not run even once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `prefix` is a list containing the single element 0 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one element. The state of `v` will be determined by the elements in `arr` during the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`arr` must have at least one element**.
