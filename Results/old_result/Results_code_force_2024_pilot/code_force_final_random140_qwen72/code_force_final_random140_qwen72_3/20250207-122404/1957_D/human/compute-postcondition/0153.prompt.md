You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: `arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point.
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: `arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `i` is 31, the range is 32.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position across all `prefix` values, `i` is 0, and `n` must be 32.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is 32, `n` is 32, `ans` is the sum of the values calculated in each iteration, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists where each sublist contains the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position across all `prefix` values, and `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing the final counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position across all `prefix` values. The `prefix` list contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point. The `arr` list remains unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the values calculated in each iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `a`, a list of lists where each sublist contains `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.
