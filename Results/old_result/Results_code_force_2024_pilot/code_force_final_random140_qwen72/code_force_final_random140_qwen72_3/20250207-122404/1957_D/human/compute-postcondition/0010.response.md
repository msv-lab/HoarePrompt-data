Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`.** 

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `pre` as a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`. The values of `arr` and `prefix` remain unchanged.
