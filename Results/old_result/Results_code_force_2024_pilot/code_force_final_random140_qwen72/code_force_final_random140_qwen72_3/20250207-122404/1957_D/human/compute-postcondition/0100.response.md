Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is 23, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 31**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `y.bit_length() - 1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `y`, `ans`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` depends on the bit length of `y`. Since `y` is `arr[1]`, the exact value of `k` will be determined by the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1.
