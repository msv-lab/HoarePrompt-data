Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` of `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` of `c` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates 32 times, from `j = 0` to `j = 31`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks the bit at position `j` of the variable `c` (which is `prefix[2]`).
- If the bit at position `j` of `c` is 1, it increments `pre[j][1]` by 1 and decrements `suf[j][1]` by 1.
- If the bit at position `j` of `c` is 0, it increments `pre[j][0]` by 1 and decrements `suf[j][0]` by 1.
- After 32 iterations, `j` will be back to its initial value of 31, but the arrays `pre` and `suf` will have been updated based on the bits of `c`.
