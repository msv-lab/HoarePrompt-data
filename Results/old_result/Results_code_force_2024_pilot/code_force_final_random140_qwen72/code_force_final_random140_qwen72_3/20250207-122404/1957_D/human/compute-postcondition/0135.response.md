Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + 2 * (pre[y.bit_length() - 1][0] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][0] + pre[y.bit_length() - 1][1] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][1])`, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 0, the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0, `pre[0][0]` is incremented by 1, `suf[0][0]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `suf[0][0]` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
