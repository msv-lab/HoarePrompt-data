Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `arr[0].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is 23, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 0, the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0, `pre[0][0]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.** 

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Since `j` is 0, the value of `suf[0][0]` is decreased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
