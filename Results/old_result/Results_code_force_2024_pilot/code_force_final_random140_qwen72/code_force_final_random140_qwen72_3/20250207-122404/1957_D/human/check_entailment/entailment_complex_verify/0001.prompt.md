You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the values calculated in each iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr` from the input. It calculates a value `ans` based on the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` and the bit counts of these cumulative XOR values. The function then prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The input list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in the `prefix` list. This is done correctly by iterating through the array and updating the prefix XOR value at each step.

3. **Pre and Suf Arrays**:
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are used to keep track of the counts of bits set to 0 and 1 for each bit position (from 0 to 31).
   - Initially, `pre` is set to count the number of leading zeros (which is 1 for the initial prefix value of 0).

4. **Suf Array Update**:
   - The `suf` array is updated in reverse order to count the number of bits set to 0 and 1 for each bit position from the end of the array to the beginning.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates through each element of the array, updating the answer `ans` based on the current element `y` and its bit positions.
   - The variable `k` is set to the highest bit position of the current element `y`.
   - The answer is incremented by the product of the counts of bits set to 0 and 1 in the `pre` and `suf` arrays for the bit position `k`.
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are updated to reflect the current prefix XOR value `c`.

6. **Output**:
   - The final answer for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The logic for calculating the prefix XOR and updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays is sound.
- The main loop correctly updates the answer based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
