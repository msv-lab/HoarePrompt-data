Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where the first sublist is `[1, 0]`, the second sublist is `[2, 0]`, and the third sublist is now `[3, 0]`, while the remaining sublists are `[0, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `i` is 2, the range is 32.**
