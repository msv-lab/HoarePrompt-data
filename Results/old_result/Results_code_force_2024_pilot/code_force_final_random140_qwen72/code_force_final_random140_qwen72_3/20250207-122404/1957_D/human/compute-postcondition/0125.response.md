Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 31**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `arr[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, `y` is now `arr[2]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
