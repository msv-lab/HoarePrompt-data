Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`, and `results` now contains one additional element. If `count_ones` is 2, the additional element is 'no' if '11' is in `arr`, otherwise it is 'yes'. If `count_ones` is not 2, the additional element is 'yes'.***
