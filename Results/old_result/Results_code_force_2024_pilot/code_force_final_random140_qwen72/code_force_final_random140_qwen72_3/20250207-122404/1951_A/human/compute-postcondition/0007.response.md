The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. This changes the state of `results` from an empty list to a list containing one element, which is the string `'yes'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing `['yes']`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, and `count_ones` is 0.**
