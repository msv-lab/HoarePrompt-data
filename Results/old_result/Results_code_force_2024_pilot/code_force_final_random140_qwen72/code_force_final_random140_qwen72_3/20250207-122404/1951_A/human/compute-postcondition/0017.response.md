Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing either the string 'no' or 'yes', `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, `count_ones` is greater than 0, `count_ones` is even, and the current value of `count_ones` is 2. If the substring '11' is present in `arr`, `results` contains the string 'no'. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'yes'.***
