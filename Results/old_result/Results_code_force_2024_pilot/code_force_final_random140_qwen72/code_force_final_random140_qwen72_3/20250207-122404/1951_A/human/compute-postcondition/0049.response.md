Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is an integer representing the total number of iterations, `results` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` is determined based on the input `arr` for each iteration: if `arr` contains no '1's, the element is 'yes'; if `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, the element is 'no'; if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11' is present, the element is 'no'; otherwise, if `arr` contains exactly two '1's but the substring '11' is not present, the element is 'yes'; if `arr` contains an even number of '1's greater than 2, the element is 'yes'.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the list `results` will contain `t` elements, each determined by the conditions specified in the loop for each input `arr`. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
