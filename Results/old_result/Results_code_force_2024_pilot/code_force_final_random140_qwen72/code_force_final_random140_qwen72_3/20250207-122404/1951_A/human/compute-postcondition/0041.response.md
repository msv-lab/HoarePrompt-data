The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This operation modifies the `results` list by adding a new element to it. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `count_ones`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`, `results` now contains one more element, which is the string 'no'.**
