The code snippet `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This impacts the content of the `results` list but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains `['yes', 'no']`. If `count_ones` is greater than 0 and odd, `results` contains `['no', 'no']`. If `count_ones` is even and equal to 2, `results` contains `['no', 'no']` if the substring '11' is present in the new `arr`, otherwise `results` contains `['yes', 'no']`. If `count_ones` is even and not 2, `results` contains `['yes', 'no']`.**
