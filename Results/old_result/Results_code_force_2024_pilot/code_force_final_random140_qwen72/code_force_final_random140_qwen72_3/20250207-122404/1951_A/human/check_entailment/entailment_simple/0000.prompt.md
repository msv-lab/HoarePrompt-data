Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:

current_dir = os.getcwd() subfolders = [f.path for f in
os.scandir(current_dir) if f.is_dir()] for folder in subfolders: #
检查文件夹名称是否在指定范围内 folder_name = os.path.basename(folder) if

获取子文件夹中的所有.html文件 html_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder) if
f.endswith('.html')] print(f"Folder '{folder}' contains {len(html_files)} HTML
files.") # 为每个.html文件生成对应的文件 for html_file in html_files: base_name =

创建文件 open(ac_file, 'w').close() open(wa_file, 'w').close() print(f"Generated

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers where start <= end, and they represent the range of folder names to be processed. The current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        count_ones = arr.count('1')
        
        if count_ones == 0:
            results.append('yes')
        elif count_ones % 2 != 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif count_ones == 2:
            if '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:
                results.append('yes')

    #State: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is an integer representing the total number of iterations, `results` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` is determined based on the input `arr` for each iteration: if `arr` contains no '1's, the element is 'yes'; if `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, the element is 'no'; if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11' is present, the element is 'no'; otherwise, if `arr` contains exactly two '1's but the substring '11' is not present, the element is 'yes'; if `arr` contains an even number of '1's greater than 2, the element is 'yes'.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, and each element in `results` has been printed.
