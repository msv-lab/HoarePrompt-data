Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`, and `count_ones` is greater than 0. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains one element 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, and if `count_ones` is 2, `results` contains 'no' if the substring '11' is present in `arr`, otherwise `results` contains 'yes'. If `count_ones` is even and not 2, `results` contains 'yes'.***
