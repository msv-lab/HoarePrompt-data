Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`, `results` remains unchanged except that it now contains one additional element. If '11' is in `arr`, the additional element is 'no'. Otherwise, the additional element is 'yes'.***
