Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `arr` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then evaluates `arr` and appends 'yes' or 'no' to a list `results` based on the following rules: if `arr` contains no '1's, the result is 'yes'; if `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, the result is 'no'; if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11' is present, the result is 'no'; otherwise, the result is 'yes'. Finally, it prints each element in `results`. The function does not process subfolders or handle `.html` files as mentioned in the annotations. **
