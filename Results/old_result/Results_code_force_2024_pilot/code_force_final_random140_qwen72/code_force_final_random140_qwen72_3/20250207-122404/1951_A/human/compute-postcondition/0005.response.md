The code snippet `count_ones = arr.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `arr` and assigns this count to the variable `count_ones`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `results`, `n`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`.**
