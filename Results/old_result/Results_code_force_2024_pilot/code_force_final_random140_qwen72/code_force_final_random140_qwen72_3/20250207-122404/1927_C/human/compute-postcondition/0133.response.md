Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by the number of times `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` during the loop execution. Otherwise, if `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by the number of times `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` during the loop execution. If `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, they retain these values. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.***
