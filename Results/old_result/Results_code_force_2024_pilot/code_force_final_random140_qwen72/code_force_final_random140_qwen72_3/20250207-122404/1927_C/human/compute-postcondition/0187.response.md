Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now 1. `leftOnes` must be greater than 1. `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains unchanged. `aOnes` and `bOnes` represent the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`, and in `b` but not in `a`, respectively.**
