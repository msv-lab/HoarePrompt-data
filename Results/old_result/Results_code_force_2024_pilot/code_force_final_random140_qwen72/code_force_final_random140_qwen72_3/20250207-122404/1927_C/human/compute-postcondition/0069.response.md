Output State: **`n` is the first integer from input (greater than 0), `m` is the second integer from input (greater than 0), `k` is the third integer from input (greater than 0), `t` is the next value in the range, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `b` but not in `a`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input and converts it into a frozenset of integers, updating the value of `a`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `b`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
