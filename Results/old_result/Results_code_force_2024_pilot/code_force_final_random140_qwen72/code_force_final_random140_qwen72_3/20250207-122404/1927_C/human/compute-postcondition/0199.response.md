Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now equal to `leftOnes`. `aOnes` and `bOnes` are such that their values have been adjusted by incrementing the smaller one until `i` reaches `leftOnes`. This means if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` at the start, `aOnes` would have been incremented `leftOnes` times, or vice versa. Additionally, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.**
