The value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1, `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes`, and `bOnes` is incremented by 1.**
