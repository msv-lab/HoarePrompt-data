Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1), `a` is a frozenset of integers read from a new input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the latest input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `1`, `leftOnes` is `0`, `aOnes` is the number of times `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` during the loop execution if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, otherwise `aOnes` is the number of times `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` during the loop execution, `bOnes` is `1` if `i` is in `b` and `0` otherwise. If `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, they retain these values. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`. Additionally, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1`. Furthermore, `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` is set to `1`. If `i` is not in `b`, `bOnes` remains `0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
