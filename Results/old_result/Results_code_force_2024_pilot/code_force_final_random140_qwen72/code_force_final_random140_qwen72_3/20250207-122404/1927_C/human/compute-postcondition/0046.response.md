Output State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the total number of iterations the loop will run, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b` plus 1, `bOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `b` but not in `a`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`.**
