Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). Arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    leftOnes = 0
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            leftOnes += 1
        elif i in a:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    i = 0
    while i < leftOnes:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the total number of iterations the loop will run, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `b` but not in `a`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then no changes are made to `aOnes` or `bOnes`. Otherwise, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` is incremented by `leftOnes`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by the number of times `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` during the loop execution. Otherwise, if `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by the number of times `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` during the loop execution. If `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, they retain these values. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now equal to `leftOnes`. `aOnes` and `bOnes` have been adjusted by incrementing the smaller one until `i` reaches `leftOnes`. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then they are both equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
