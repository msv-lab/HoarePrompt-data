### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the lengths of the arrays `n` and `m`, and the value of `k`.

2. **Set Conversion**: The function converts the input arrays `a` and `b` into `frozenset` objects. This is efficient for membership testing, which is used later in the code.

3. **Initialization**: The variables `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These variables will keep track of how many numbers from 1 to `k` are found in both arrays, only in array `a`, and only in array `b`, respectively.

4. **Counting Elements**: The loop from `i = 1` to `i <= k` checks each number from 1 to `k`:
   - If the number is in both `a` and `b`, it increments `leftOnes`.
   - If the number is only in `a`, it increments `aOnes`.
   - If the number is only in `b`, it increments `bOnes`.
   - If the number is not found in either array, the loop breaks early, indicating that it's impossible to form the required set.

5. **Balancing Elements**: After counting the elements, the function attempts to balance the counts of `aOnes` and `bOnes` using the `leftOnes`. It does this by incrementing the smaller count until `leftOnes` is exhausted.

6. **Final Check**: The function checks if `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk` (which is `k // 2`). If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Issues:
- **Early Break**: The loop breaks early if a number from 1 to `k` is not found in either array. This is correct because if any number from 1 to `k` is missing, it's impossible to form the required set.
- **Balancing Logic**: The balancing logic is correct. It ensures that the counts of `aOnes` and `bOnes` are balanced using the `leftOnes`.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where `k` is small or the arrays have few elements correctly.
- **Efficiency**: The use of `frozenset` for membership testing is efficient, and the overall complexity is manageable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
