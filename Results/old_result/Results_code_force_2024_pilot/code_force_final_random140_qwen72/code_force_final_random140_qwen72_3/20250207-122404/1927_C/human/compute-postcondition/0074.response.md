Output State: **`n` is the first integer from input (greater than 0), `m` is the second integer from input (greater than 0), `k` is the third integer from input (greater than 0), `t` is the next value in the range, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `b` is a new frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `newk = k // 2` updates the value of `newk` to be the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `newk` and retains the initial values of all other variables.
