Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now 0. `leftOnes` will be the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in both `a` and `b`. `aOnes` will be the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`. `bOnes` will be the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `b` but not in `a`.**
