The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` using the `map` function to convert them to integers. The input is split into three parts, which are then assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the third integer from input.**
