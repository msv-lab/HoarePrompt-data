Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in `b`, then: if `i` was in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 1; if `i` was only in `a`, `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 1; if `i` was only in `b`, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 2; if `i` was not in either `a` or `b`, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are 0 and 1, respectively, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in `b`, then: if `i` was in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` are 0; if `i` was only in `a`, `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0; if `i` was only in `b`, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1; if `i` was not in either `a` or `b`, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
