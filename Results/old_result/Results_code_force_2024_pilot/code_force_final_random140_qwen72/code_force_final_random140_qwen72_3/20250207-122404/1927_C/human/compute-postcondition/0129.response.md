Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` must be greater than or equal to 0. `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`. If `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` during the loop execution, `aOnes` has been incremented by the number of times `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`. Otherwise, if `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes` during the loop execution, `bOnes` has been incremented by the number of times `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes`.**
