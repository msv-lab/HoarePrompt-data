To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition in the loop head:

```python
while i < leftOnes:
```

The loop will execute if `i` is less than `leftOnes`. Given the current state:

- `i` is 0.
- `leftOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in both `a` and `b`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is already 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`. The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `leftOnes`.

### Adjustments:
- `leftOnes` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the total number of iterations the loop will run, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `b` but not in `a`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0**
