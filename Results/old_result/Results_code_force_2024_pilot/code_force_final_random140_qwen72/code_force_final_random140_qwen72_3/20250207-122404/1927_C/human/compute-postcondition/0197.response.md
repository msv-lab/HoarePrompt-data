Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now equal to `leftOnes`. `aOnes` and `bOnes` have been adjusted by incrementing the smaller one until `i` reaches `leftOnes`. Both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are now equal to `newk`.**
