Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1), `a` is a frozenset of integers read from a new input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the latest input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `2`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is set to `1`, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` are as described. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1, and `aOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain as described.***
