Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and `leftOnes` must be greater than 2. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains greater than the updated `aOnes`. Otherwise, if `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1, and `aOnes` remains less than or equal to `bOnes`.***
