Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1), `a` is a frozenset of integers read from a new input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the latest input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `2`, `leftOnes` is `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` is in both `a` and `b`. If `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain as described.***
