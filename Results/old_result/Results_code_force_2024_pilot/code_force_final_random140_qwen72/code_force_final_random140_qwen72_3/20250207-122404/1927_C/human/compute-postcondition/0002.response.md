The code `a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or `k` directly, but it introduces a new variable `a` which holds the frozenset of integers.

Output State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the third integer from input, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input.**
