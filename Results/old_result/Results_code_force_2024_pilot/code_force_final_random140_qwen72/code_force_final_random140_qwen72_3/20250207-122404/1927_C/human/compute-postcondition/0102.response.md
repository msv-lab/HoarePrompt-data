Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4. If `i` was in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 2, and `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` was only in `a`, then `aOnes` is 3 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` was only in `b`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 2. If `i` was not in either `a` or `b`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` remains 0, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
