Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0.
- `t` is the next value in the range (though this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`.
- During the loop execution:
  - If `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` has been incremented by the number of times `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`.
  - If `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` has been incremented by the number of times `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement simply prints the string `'yes'`.
- The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` do not affect the output of the print statement because the print statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always print the string `'yes'`, regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **yes**
