You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case includes the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by the list of integers `l`.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `l` to facilitate the checks. This is necessary because the elements of the progressive square have a specific structure, and sorting helps in verifying this structure.

3. **Range Check**: The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted list `l` is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This is a crucial check because it ensures that the range of the elements in the list matches the expected range of the progressive square.

4. **Sum Check**: The program calculates the sum of the first and last elements in the sorted list `l` and stores it in `a`. This sum should be consistent across pairs of elements in the list.

5. **Middle Element Check**: If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list `l` is equal to `a // 2`. This is necessary because in an odd-sized progressive square, the middle element has a specific value.

6. **Pair Check**: The program iterates through the first half of the sorted list and checks if each element `l[k]` is equal to its corresponding pair `l[-1 - k]`. This ensures that the elements form the required symmetric pattern.

7. **Output**: Based on the checks, the program returns "yes" if all conditions are met, otherwise it returns "no".

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given list of integers can form a progressive square. However, there is a minor issue in the output format. The problem description specifies that the output should be "YES" or "NO" (case-insensitive), but the program outputs "yes" or "no". This discrepancy could lead to incorrect results if the judge is case-sensitive.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct but fails to meet the exact output format specified in the problem description. It should output "YES" or "NO" instead of "yes" or "no".
