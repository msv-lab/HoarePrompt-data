### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Validation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d` and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Sorting the List:**
     - The list `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - **Initial Check:**
     - The program checks if the difference between the largest and smallest elements of `l` is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This ensures that the range of the elements in the list matches the expected range for a progressive square.
     - If this condition is not met, the function returns `'no'`.
   - **Middle Element Check for Odd `n`:**
     - If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list `l` is equal to half the sum of the first and last elements (`a // 2`).
     - If this condition is not met, the function returns `'NO'`.
   - **Symmetry Check:**
     - The program iterates through the first half of the sorted list and checks if each element is equal to its corresponding element from the end of the list (`l[k] == l[-1 - k]`).
     - If any pair of symmetric elements do not match, the function returns `'no'`.
   - **Final Return:**
     - If all conditions are met, the function returns `'yes'`.

3. **Logical Consistency:**
   - The conditions checked in the function ensure that the list `l` can form a progressive square with the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - The sorting and symmetry checks are necessary to verify the properties of the progressive square.
   - The middle element check for odd `n` ensures that the center element is correctly positioned.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the specified `n`, `c`, and `d`. All conditions and checks are logically consistent and necessary for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
