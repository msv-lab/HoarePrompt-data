### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to easily check the properties of the progressive square.

3. **Checking the Range of Values:**
   - The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list `l` is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This ensures that the values in the list span the correct range for a progressive square.
   - If this condition is not met, the program returns 'no', which is correct because the values do not form a valid progressive square.

4. **Checking the Middle Value for Odd `n`:**
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle value `l[r]` (where `r = n^2 // 2`) is equal to `a // 2` (where `a` is the sum of the first and last elements of `l`).
   - This is a necessary condition because in a progressive square with an odd `n`, the middle value should be the average of the first and last values.

5. **Checking Symmetry:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the sorted list and checks if each element `l[k]` is equal to its corresponding element `l[-1 - k]` (the element symmetrically opposite in the list).
   - This ensures that the list is symmetric, which is a property of a progressive square.

6. **Final Return:**
   - If all conditions are met, the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the given rules. The conditions checked are necessary and sufficient to ensure the correctness of the solution.

**Correctness: True**
