The `l.sort()` function sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the same elements as before, but they are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
