You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `c` and `d` (integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and `l` (a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The function sorts the list `l` and checks several conditions to determine if the list meets specific criteria. If the difference between the largest and smallest elements of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), the function returns 'no'. If `n` is odd and the middle element of the sorted list `l` is not equal to half the sum of the first and last elements, the function returns 'NO'. If any pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list `l` do not match, the function returns 'no'. If all these conditions are met, the function returns 'yes'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it checks the properties of the progressive square. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the elements of the sorted list `l` should form pairs that are symmetric around the middle element. However, this assumption does not align with the rules for constructing a progressive square.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Pairing Check**:
   - The program checks if `l[k] == l[-1 - k]` for all `k` up to `r = n ** 2 // 2`. This check is incorrect because the elements of the progressive square do not necessarily form symmetric pairs in this manner.
   - For example, consider the progressive square for `n = 3`, `c = 2`, and `d = 3`:
     ```
     1  3  6
     4  7  10
     7  10 13
     ```
     When flattened and sorted, the list is `[1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 10, 10, 13]`. The program would incorrectly check if `1 == 13`, `3 == 10`, etc., which is not the correct way to verify the progressive square.

2. **Middle Element Check**:
   - The program checks if the middle element `l[r]` equals `a // 2` when `n` is odd. This check is also incorrect because the middle element of the sorted list does not necessarily correspond to the middle element of the progressive square.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly verify the progressive square, the program should:
1. Construct the expected progressive square using the given `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`.
2. Flatten and sort the constructed square.
3. Compare the sorted list of the constructed square with the sorted list of the input elements.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
```
The program should construct the progressive square:
```
1  3  6
4  7  10
7  10 13
```
Flatten and sort it to get:
```
[1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 10, 10, 13]
```
Then compare this with the sorted input list:
```
[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
Since these lists are not equal, the program should return "NO".

Given these issues, the program does not correctly verify the progressive square for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
