The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `c` and `d` (integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and `l` (a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The function sorts the list `l` and checks several conditions to determine if the list meets specific criteria. If the difference between the largest and smallest elements of `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), the function returns 'no'. If `n` is odd and the middle element of the sorted list `l` is not equal to half the sum of the first and last elements, the function returns 'NO'. If any pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list `l` do not match, the function returns 'no'. If all these conditions are met, the function returns 'yes'.
