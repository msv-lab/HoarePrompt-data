The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `l` and `x`, where `l` is an integer between 1 and n, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. It prints a query string in the format "? [l] [x]" to the standard output, flushes the output buffer, reads an integer from the standard input, and returns this integer. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer `ret`.
