Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function sends a query to the judge and receives the smallest integer `r` such that `f(l, r) = x` or `n + 1` if no such `r` exists.
   - It correctly formats the query and handles the input/output as required by the problem statement.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function prints the answer `m` and checks if it is correct by reading the response from the judge.
   - It correctly handles the input/output and returns the judge's response.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It attempts to find the largest possible value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has a product of length and maximum value equal to `m`.
   - It uses a binary search-like approach to find the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns `n`.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `m` and checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required property using `func_1`.
   - If a valid `m` is found, it calls `func_2(m)`. If no valid `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_3` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input/output and ensures that `func_3` is called the correct number of times.

Overall, the functions work together to solve the problem as described. Each function performs its intended role, and the interactions with the judge are handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
