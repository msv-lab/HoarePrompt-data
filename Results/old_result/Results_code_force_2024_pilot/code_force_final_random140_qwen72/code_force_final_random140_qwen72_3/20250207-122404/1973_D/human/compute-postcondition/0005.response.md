The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `_` (the loop counter) is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_3()` has been called twice. Since the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

However, since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, we focus on the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue. After the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and for the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_3()` has been called twice**
