To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions involving the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. This means the loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j = k`.

2. **Conditions for Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. This is because the range function `range(1, k + 1)` will generate values starting from 1 up to `k` (inclusive). If `k` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `j` should start at 1, which is the initial value set by the loop.
   - `k` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop has at least one iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
- `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is `i * max_val`.
- `p` is 0.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0**.
