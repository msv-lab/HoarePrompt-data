To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0.
- `max_val` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `p` is now the result of `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`.
- `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `j`.
- If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `j` and `k`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `[1, k + 1)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `k + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `k` remains the same.
- The loop will execute again if `j < k + 1`.

Given that `k` is greater than 0 and `j` is incremented by 1, the new state should reflect these changes.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is now the result of `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`. `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `j`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Simplified:
State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, `max_val` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `m` remains the same, `p` is now the result of `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `j`.**
