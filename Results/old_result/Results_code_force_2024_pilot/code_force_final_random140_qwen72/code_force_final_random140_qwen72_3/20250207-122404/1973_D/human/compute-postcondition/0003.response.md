The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_3()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but since the loop counter `_` is not used, it does not affect the state.

However, since the loop counter `_` is incremented implicitly by the `range(t)` function, the effective state change is that `t` is decremented by 1 (as each iteration consumes one of the `t` values).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0, but since one iteration has completed, `t` is now one less than it was at the start of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_3()` has been called.** 

(Note: The state of `func_3()` being called remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution condition.)
