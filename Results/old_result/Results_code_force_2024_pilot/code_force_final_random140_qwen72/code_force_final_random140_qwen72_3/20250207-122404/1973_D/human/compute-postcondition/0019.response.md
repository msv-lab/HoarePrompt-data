To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `n // k` down to 1 (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` (which is `n // k`) must be greater than 0.
- The loop will not execute if `n // k` is 0 or negative.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `n // k` is greater than 0.
- This means `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

### Final State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `max_val` remains as defined.
- `i` starts at `n // k`, which must be greater than 0.

### State:
**`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0.**
