Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `p` is not equal to `n`.
- The code snippet `p = 0` sets the value of `p` to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The condition that `p` is not equal to `n` is still valid since `p` is now 0, which is different from `n` (a positive integer).
- The output state reflects these changes and maintains the initial conditions for the other variables.
