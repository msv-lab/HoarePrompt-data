The function `func_3` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`. It then attempts to find the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` that is equal to `n`. If such an `i` is found, it sets `max_val` to this `i`. Next, it iterates over values of `i` from `n // k` down to 1, calculating `m` as `i * max_val`. For each `m`, it applies `func_1` repeatedly, starting from `p = 1` and incrementing `p` by 1 each time, up to `k` times. If `p` reaches `n`, it calls `func_2(m)` and returns. If no such `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`. The function does not return any value explicitly.
