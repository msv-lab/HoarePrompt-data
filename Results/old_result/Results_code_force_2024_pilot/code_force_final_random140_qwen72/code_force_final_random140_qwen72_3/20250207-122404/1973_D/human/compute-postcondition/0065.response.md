Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than 0, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is 1, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.**

Explanation:
- `p` is updated to the result of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
- The value of `p` before the function call was 0, so `p + 1` is 1.
- `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
