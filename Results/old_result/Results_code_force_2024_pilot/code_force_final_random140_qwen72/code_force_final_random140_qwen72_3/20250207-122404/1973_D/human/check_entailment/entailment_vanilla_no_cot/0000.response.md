Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Search for Maximum Value**: The function `func_3` attempts to find the maximum value `max_val` by querying the entire array length `n` for each possible value of `i` from `n` down to `1`. This approach is flawed because it assumes that the maximum value `max_val` can be found by multiplying `i` with `n`, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach should involve finding the maximum value in the array and then using it to determine the possible values of `m`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**: The program calculates `m` as `i * max_val` and then tries to find a valid partition. However, this calculation does not ensure that the subarrays will have the same value of `f(l, r)`. The correct approach should involve checking if the array can be partitioned into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has the same value of `f(l, r)`.

3. **Handling of Queries**: The program does not handle the queries efficiently. It makes unnecessary queries and does not ensure that the number of queries does not exceed the limit of `2 * n`.

4. **Assertion Errors**: The assertions in the code are too strict and may cause the program to fail prematurely. For example, the assertion `assert r == n` is not always true and can lead to a failure if the condition is not met.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k = 1` or when the array has a specific structure that makes it difficult to partition.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be rewritten to correctly find the maximum value `m` and ensure that the array can be partitioned into `k` subarrays with the same value of `f(l, r)`. The number of queries should also be minimized to avoid exceeding the limit.
