The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are positive integers and satisfy the condition 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. 

- **Case_1**: If certain conditions within the function lead to a specific path, the function returns the value of `n`.
- **Case_2**: In another scenario, the function does not specify any value to return, effectively returning nothing.
- **Case_3**: Similarly, in some cases, the function does not return any value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4) and either return the value of `n` or return nothing depending on the internal logic of the function.
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4). It may return the value of `n` or return nothing based on the internal logic.**
