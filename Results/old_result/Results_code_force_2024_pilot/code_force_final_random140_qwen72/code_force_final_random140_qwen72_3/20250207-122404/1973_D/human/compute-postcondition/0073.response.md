The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `k` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the condition `j < k + 1` to hold true.

State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 2, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is 3, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
