Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0. `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0. `m` is `i * max_val`. `p` is the result of `func_1(1, m)`, and `p` is greater than or equal to `n`. `j` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 0.**
