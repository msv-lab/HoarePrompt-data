To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

### Analysis:
- The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, k + 1):`.
- For the loop to execute, `range(1, k + 1)` must generate at least one value. This means `k` must be at least 1 (since `range(1, 1 + 1)` would generate the sequence `[1]`).

### States to Adjust:
- `j` should start at 1, which is the initial value in the `range(1, k + 1)`.
- `k` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
- `i` is `n // k - 1`.
- `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`.
- `p` is 0.
- `j` is `k`.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `p` is not equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `j` should be 1 and `k` should be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, and `p` is not equal to `n`.**
