Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` is equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `n // k` is greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, `k` is at least 2, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `p` remains the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.**
