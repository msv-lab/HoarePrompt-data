Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 2`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `max_val` is updated to `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `max_val = i` updates the value of `max_val` to the current value of `i`, which is `n - 2`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, and `r`) remain unchanged. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `max_val` would be further updated to `n - 1` and the loop or if statement would be broken, but this part of the condition is not executed in this snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the immediate changes made by the code.
