You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        
        if r <= n:
            assert r == n
            max_val = i
            break
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
    for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
        m = i * max_val
        
        p = 0
        
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            p = func_1(p + 1, m)
            if p >= n:
                break
        
        if p == n:
            func_2(m)
            return
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 1. `max_val` remains the same. `i` is 0, as the loop decrements `i` from `n // k` down to 1 and then stops. `m` is 0, because `m` is calculated as `i * max_val` and `i` is 0. `p` is the final value obtained from the repeated application of `func_1` starting from `p = 1` and incrementing by 1 each time, until `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` or the loop completes all `k` iterations. `j` is the final value of the loop counter, which will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`. The loop will terminate without calling `func_2(m)` if `p` never equals `n` for any iteration.
    func_2(-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters explicitly but operates on implicit parameters `n` and `k` (positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4). It does not return any value explicitly. Instead, it modifies a variable `p` using a loop and the function `func_1`, with the final value of `p` depending on the implementation of `func_1` and the value of `max_val`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value explicitly. However, based on the initial state and the provided code, the final value of `p` after the loop completes all iterations would be the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, where `p` initially equals `n`, and `m` is calculated as `i * max_val` with `i` being `n // k`. The exact value of `p` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the value of `max_val`.

Case_2: The program does not return any value.

Case_3: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
