The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `k` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
