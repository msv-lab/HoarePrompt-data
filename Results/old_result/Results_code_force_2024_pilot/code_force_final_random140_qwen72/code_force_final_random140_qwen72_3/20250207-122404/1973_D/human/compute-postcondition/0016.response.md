Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n - 2`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The value of `max_val` remains `n - 2`.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 2`.
- The value of `r` is still the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`.
- The `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables.
