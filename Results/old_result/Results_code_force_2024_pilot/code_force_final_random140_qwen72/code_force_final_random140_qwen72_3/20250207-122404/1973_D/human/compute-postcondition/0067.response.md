Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than 0, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is 1, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and the current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
