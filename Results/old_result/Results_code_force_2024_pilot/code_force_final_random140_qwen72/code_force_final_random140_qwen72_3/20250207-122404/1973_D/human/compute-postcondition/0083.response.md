Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 1. `max_val` remains the same. `i` is 0. `m` is 0. `p` is the final value obtained from the repeated application of `func_1` starting from `p = 1` and incrementing by 1 each time, until `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` or the loop completes all `k` iterations. `j` is the final value of the loop counter, which will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`. The function `func_2` is called with the argument `-1`.**
