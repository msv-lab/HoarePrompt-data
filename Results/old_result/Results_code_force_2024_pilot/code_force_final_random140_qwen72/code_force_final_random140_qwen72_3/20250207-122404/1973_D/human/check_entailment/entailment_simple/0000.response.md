Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is used to make a query to the judge. It prints a query in the required format and reads the response. The function works as expected and handles the input/output correctly.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is used to submit the answer to the judge. It prints the answer in the required format and reads the response. The function works as expected and handles the input/output correctly.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function handles the logic for a single test case. It attempts to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays where the product of the length and the maximum of each subarray equals `m`, or `-1` if no such `m` exists.

   - **Finding `max_val`**: The function iterates from `n` down to `1` to find the largest `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. This part seems to be attempting to find the maximum possible value of `m` by checking the largest possible subarray product that fits within the constraints. However, the condition `assert r == n` is too strict and may fail if the subarray does not cover the entire array, which is not always necessary.

   - **Checking for valid `m`**: The function then iterates from `n // k` down to `1` to find a valid `m` by repeatedly applying `func_1` to check if the subarray products match `m`. If a valid `m` is found, it is submitted using `func_2(m)`. If no valid `m` is found, `-1` is submitted.

   - **Potential Issues**:
     - The `assert r == n` condition in the `max_val` search is too restrictive. It should be relaxed to allow for subarrays that do not necessarily cover the entire array.
     - The logic for finding `m` might not be optimal. The function should ensure that the subarrays are valid and cover the entire array.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_3` for each test case. It works as expected and handles the input/output correctly.

Given the potential issues in `func_3`, particularly the overly restrictive `assert r == n` condition and the logic for finding `m`, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
