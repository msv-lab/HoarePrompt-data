The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1. The variable `j` should start from 1 as specified in the loop head.

State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than 0, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `p` is not equal to `n`**
