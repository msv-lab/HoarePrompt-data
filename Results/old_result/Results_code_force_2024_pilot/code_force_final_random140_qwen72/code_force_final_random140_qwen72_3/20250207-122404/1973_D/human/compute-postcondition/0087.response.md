Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` is equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `n // k` is greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `k` is at least 1, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is set to 0 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `p` remains the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = k`.
- In each iteration, `p` is updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
- If `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` at any point, it is reset to 0 and the loop breaks.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `k`, and `p` will be the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, or 0 if the loop broke due to `p` being greater than or equal to `n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
