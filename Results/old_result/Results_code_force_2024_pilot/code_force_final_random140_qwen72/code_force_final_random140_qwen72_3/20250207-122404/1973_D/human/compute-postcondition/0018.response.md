Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `n` down to `1`.
- For each iteration, it calculates `r` using `func_1(1, i * n)`.
- If `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`, `max_val` is set to the current value of `i` and the loop breaks.
- If no such `i` is found, `max_val` remains 0.
- After all iterations, `max_val` will be the largest integer `i` that satisfies the condition, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
