To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
   - `i` is `n // k - 1`.
   - `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`.
   - `p` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `p` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   p = func_1(p + 1, m)
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - `p` is updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - `p + 1` is `1` because `p` was initially `0`.
   - The new value of `p` depends on the result of `func_1(1, m)`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `n` and `k` remain the same.
   - `max_val` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `p` is now the result of `func_1(1, m)`.
   - `j` remains the same.
   - `k` remains greater than 0.
   - `p` is not equal to `n` unless `func_1(1, m)` returns `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(1, m)`, `j` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless `func_1(1, m)` returns `n`.**
