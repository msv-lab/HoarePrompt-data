The value of `max_val` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`**.
