Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    m = i * max_val
    p = 0
    for j in range(1, k + 1):
        p = func_1(p + 1, m)
        if p >= n:
            break
    if p == n:
        func_2(m)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has completed all iterations, `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations, `n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is the final value obtained from the repeated application of `func_1` starting from `p = 1` and incrementing by 1 each time, until `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` or the loop completes all `k` iterations. `j` is the final value of the loop counter, which will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is the minimum of `k` and the value of `j` when `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, which could be less than `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or it could be greater than or equal to `n` if the loop breaks early, and `p` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
