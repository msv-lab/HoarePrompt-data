To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0.
- `max_val` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `p` is the final value obtained from the repeated application of `func_1` starting from `p = 1` and incrementing by 1 each time, until `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` or the loop completes all `k` iterations.
- `j` is the final value of the loop counter, which will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`.
- `p` is not equal to `n`.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop iterates over `i` in the range `n // k` down to 1 (inclusive).
2. The loop condition is that `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` remains the same, but for the next iteration, `i` must be decremented by 1.

Since the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, we need to decrement `i` by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` remains the same, `p` remains the same, `j` remains the same, `p` is not equal to `n`**.
