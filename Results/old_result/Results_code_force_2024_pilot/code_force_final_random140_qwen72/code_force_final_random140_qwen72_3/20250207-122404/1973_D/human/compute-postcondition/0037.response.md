To determine the output state, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
   - `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is `i * max_val`.
   - `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has completed all iterations, and `p` is currently equal to `n`.
   - `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet provided is `func_2(m)`.
   - This function call does not modify any of the variables directly mentioned in the initial state. However, it may have side effects depending on the implementation of `func_2`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - Since `func_2(m)` is called, it might perform some operations, but without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine its exact impact on the variables.
   - Assuming `func_2` does not modify any global variables or return any values that affect the state, the variables remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` and `k` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `max_val` remains the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
   - `i` remains `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` remains `i * max_val`.
   - `p` remains the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has completed all iterations, and `p` is currently equal to `n`.
   - `j` remains `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0. `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0. `m` is `i * max_val`. `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has completed all iterations, and `p` is currently equal to `n`. `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0.**
