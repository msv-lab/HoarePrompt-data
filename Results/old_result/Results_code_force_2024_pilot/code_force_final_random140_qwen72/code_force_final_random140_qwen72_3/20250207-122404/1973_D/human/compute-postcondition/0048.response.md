The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` remains the same, and `k` remains greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than `j`.

Given that `j` was the same at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `j` was not yet at its maximum value (which is `k`). Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than this new value of `j`.

State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is now the result of `func_1(1, m)`. `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `j`.**
