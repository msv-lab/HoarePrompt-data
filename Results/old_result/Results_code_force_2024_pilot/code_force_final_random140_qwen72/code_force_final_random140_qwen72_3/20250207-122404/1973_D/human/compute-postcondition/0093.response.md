The function `func_2(-1)` is called, which does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. `n` and `k` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). `i` is 0, as it has been decremented through the entire range from `n // k` to 0. `max_val` remains the largest value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` is equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists. `m` is the last value calculated as `i * max_val`, where `i` is the last non-zero value before the loop terminates. `p` is the final value after the inner loop completes, and it is less than `n` since the loop did not return early due to `p` being equal to `n`. The function `func_2(m)` was not called, and now `func_2(-1)` has been called.**
