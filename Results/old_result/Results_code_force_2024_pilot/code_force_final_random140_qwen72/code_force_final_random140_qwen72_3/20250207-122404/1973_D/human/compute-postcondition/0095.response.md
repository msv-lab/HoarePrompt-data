Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes no explicit parameters but reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). It aims to find a specific value `m` such that a series of calls to `func_1` results in a value `p` equal to `n`. If such a value `m` is found, it calls `func_2(m)` and returns. If no such value is found, it calls `func_2(-1)` and returns. The function does not return any value directly; its primary action is to call `func_2` with either a valid `m` or `-1`. **
