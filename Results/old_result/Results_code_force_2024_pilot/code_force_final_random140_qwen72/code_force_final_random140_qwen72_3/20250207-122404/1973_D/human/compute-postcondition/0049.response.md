Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is now the result of `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`. `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `j`.**

Explanation:
- `p` was initially set to the result of `func_1(1, m)`.
- The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates `p` to the result of `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `j + 1`.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than the new value of `j` is still valid.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`) remain unchanged.
