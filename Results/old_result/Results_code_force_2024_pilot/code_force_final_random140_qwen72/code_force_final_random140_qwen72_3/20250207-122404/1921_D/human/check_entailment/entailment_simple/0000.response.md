### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting**: Both lists `a` and `b` are sorted. Sorting is necessary because we want to maximize the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b`. By sorting, we can ensure that we are always considering the smallest and largest possible differences at each step.

3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The program uses a two-pointer technique to iterate through the sorted lists `a` and `b`. The pointers `a1` and `a2` track the current positions in `a`, while `b1` and `b2` track the current positions in `b`.

4. **Maximizing Differences**: The program calculates four possible differences at each step:
   - `dif1`: Difference between the smallest element in `a` and the smallest element in `b`.
   - `dif2`: Difference between the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `b`.
   - `dif3`: Difference between the largest element in `a` and the smallest element in `b`.
   - `dif4`: Difference between the largest element in `a` and the largest element in `b`.

   It then selects the maximum difference among these four and adds it to the result `ans`. The corresponding pointers are adjusted accordingly to move to the next elements.

5. **Output**: After processing all elements in `a`, the program prints the accumulated maximum difference `ans`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when all elements in `b` are the same (as in the second test case).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). The use of sorting and the two-pointer technique ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered at each step.

**Correctness: **True****
