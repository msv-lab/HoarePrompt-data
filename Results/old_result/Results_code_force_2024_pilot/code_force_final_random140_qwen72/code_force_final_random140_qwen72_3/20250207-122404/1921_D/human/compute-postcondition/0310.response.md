The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif4`. The initial value of `ans` was 0, so after this operation, `ans` will be equal to `dif4`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif4`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`. Additionally, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, and `dif4` is greater than `dif1`.**
