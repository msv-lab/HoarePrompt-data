Postcondition: ***`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` as described, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`. If `dif3 > dif4`, then: if `dif3 > dif2`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, `b2` retains its value, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`; otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `a1` is now less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1` retains its value, `b2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then: if `dif4 > dif2`, `a1` is decremented by 1, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`; otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, and `b2` is decremented by 1.***
