Output State: **t is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; n and m are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**
