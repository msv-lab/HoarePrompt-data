The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2-1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2-1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1.**
