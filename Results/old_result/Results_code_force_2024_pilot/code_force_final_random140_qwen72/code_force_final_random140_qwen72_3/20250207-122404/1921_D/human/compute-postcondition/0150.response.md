Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0), `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
