The code snippet `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `b` but does not affect any other variables. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input.**
