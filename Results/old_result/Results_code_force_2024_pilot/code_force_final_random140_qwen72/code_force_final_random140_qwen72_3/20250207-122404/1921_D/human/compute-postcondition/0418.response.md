Postcondition: ***t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If the script is executed as the main module, `a1` is set to `n`, `a2` is set to -1, `b1` is set to `m`, `b2` is set to -1, and `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` chosen during the loop for all test cases.***
