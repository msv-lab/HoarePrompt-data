The code snippet `ans += dif1` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif1`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `ans` or `dif1`. Therefore, we can only state that `ans` is updated by adding `dif1` to its current value.

The values of `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`dif2` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a1` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b1` of list `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `ans` is incremented by `dif1`.**
