The value of `ans` is incremented by `dif3`. The value of `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. The other variables (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) remain unchanged. The condition that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` still holds.

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.**
