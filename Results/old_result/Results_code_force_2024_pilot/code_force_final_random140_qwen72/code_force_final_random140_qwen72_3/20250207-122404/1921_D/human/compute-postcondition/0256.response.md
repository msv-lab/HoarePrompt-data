Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2` (which is now `a2 - 1`), `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration (but is now decremented by 1), `b1` remains unchanged, `b2` is now `b2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `t` remains unchanged, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**
