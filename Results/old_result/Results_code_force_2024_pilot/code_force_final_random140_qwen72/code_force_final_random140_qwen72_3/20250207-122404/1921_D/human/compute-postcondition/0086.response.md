Postcondition: ***`dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences as initially defined. If `dif3` > `dif4`, and `dif3` > `dif1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif3` > `dif4`, but `dif3` ≤ `dif1`, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b1` is incremented by 1. If `dif3` ≤ `dif4`, and `dif4` > `dif1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif3` ≤ `dif4`, and `dif4` ≤ `dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b1 + 1` of list `b`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1.***
