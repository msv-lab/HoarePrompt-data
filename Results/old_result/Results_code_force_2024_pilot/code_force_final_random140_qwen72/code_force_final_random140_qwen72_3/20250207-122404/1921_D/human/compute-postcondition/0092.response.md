The value of `b2` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`a1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a1` (which is now `a1 + 1`) of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b1` of list `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `ans` is increased by `dif2`; `b2` is decreased by 1.**
