Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the specified elements of arrays `a` and `b`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. In both these cases, `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2+1]`, `dif3` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1]`, and `dif4` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2+1]`. If neither `dif3` is greater than `dif4` nor `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. In this case, `dif1` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif2` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`, and `dif4` is updated to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. In all cases, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time.***
