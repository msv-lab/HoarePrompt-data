The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif2`. The other variables (`dif1`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `t` remain unchanged; `ans` is increased by `dif2`.**
