The value of `ans` is incremented by `dif1`. The value of `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. The other variables (`dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.**
