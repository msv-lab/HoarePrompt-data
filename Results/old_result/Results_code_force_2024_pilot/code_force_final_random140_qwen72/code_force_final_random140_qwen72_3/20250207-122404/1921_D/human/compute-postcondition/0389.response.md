The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The condition that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` still holds true.

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is now `a1 + 1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `b1` is now `b1 + 1`.**
