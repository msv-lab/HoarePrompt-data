Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the specified elements of arrays `a` and `b`. If `dif3 > dif2`, then `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif2` remains the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2-1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` remains the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is now `a1 + 1` and is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, and `b2` is now `b2 - 1`.***
