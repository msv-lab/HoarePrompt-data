The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif1`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. Since `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, the new value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus this absolute difference.

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.**
