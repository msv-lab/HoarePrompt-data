Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is the new value of `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b1` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
