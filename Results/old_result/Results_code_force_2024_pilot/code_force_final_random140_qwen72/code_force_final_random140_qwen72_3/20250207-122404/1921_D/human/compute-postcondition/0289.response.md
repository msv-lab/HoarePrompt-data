The code snippet `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration. The values of the other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
