The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is `n`
- `a2` is `-1`
- `b1` is `m`
- `b2` is `-1`
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic
- `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0)
- `n` is the first integer from input
- `m` is the second integer from input

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is updated with the new input values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `-1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `-1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic, `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0), `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input.**
