Postcondition: **`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparison between `dif3` and `dif1`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, then `a1` remains 0, `a2` becomes `n - 2`, `b1` becomes 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif3`, and `t` is decremented by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0). Otherwise, `a1` becomes 1, `a2` remains `n - 1`, `b1` becomes 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `t` is decremented by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0). The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their original definitions and relationships as specified in the precondition.**
