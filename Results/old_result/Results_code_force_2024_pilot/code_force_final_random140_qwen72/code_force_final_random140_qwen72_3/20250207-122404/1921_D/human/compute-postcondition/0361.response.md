Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new indices of `a` and `b`. If `dif4 > dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `b2` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1. `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `t` retain their respective changes as described.***
