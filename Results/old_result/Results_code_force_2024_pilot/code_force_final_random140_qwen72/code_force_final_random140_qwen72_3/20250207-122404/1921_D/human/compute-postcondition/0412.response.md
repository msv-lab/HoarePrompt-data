Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the specified elements of arrays `a` and `b`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and the new `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated indices. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2+1]`, and the new `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated indices. In both cases, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`, and `b2` is decreased by 1.***
