The value of `a1` is incremented by 1. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The condition that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` is still valid.

Output State: **`a1` is `a1 + 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`.**
