Output State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` chosen during the loop, and `t` is `t - n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`a1` and `a2`**: After the loop completes, `a1` will be equal to `n` (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time it is updated), and `a2` will be `n - 1` (since it starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 each time it is updated).
- **`b1` and `b2`**: Similarly, `b1` will be equal to `m` (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time it is updated), and `b2` will be `m - 1` (since it starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 each time it is updated).
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` accumulates the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` chosen during each iteration of the loop. The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values in the lists `a` and `b`, but it will be the sum of these maximum differences.
- **`t`**: The variable `t` is decremented by 1 each time the loop iterates. Since the loop runs `n` times (as `a1` goes from 0 to `n`), `t` will be `t - n` after the loop completes.
- **`a` and `b`**: The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are only used for comparison and not modified.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
