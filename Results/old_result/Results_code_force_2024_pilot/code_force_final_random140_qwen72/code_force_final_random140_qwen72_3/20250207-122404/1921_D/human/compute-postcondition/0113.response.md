Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1-1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time, `b1` is increased by 1.**
