Postcondition: ***`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` and `dif4` are updated based on the condition. If `dif3 > dif1`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`. Otherwise, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`. `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `t` remain unchanged where applicable.***
