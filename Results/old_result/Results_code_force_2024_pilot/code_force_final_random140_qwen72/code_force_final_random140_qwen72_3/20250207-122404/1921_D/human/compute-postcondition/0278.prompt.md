Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0), `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, then: if `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif1`, `a1` remains 0, `a2` becomes `n - 2`, `b1` becomes 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif3`, and `t` is decremented by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0); if `dif3 > dif4`, but `dif3 <= dif1`, `a1` becomes 1, `a2` remains `n - 1`, `b1` becomes 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `t` is decremented by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0); if `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif4`; if `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 <= dif1`, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif1`. If `dif1 <= dif2`, then: if `dif3 > dif4`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3`; if `dif3 <= dif4`, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif2`. In all cases, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their original definitions and relationships as specified in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, the following updates occur: if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, `b2` retains its value, and `ans` is updated to `ans + abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`. If `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 <= dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `a1` is now less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` is incremented by 1, `b2` retains its value, and `ans` is updated to `ans + abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`. If `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 > dif1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0. If `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 <= dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + abs(a[a1-1] - b[b1-1])`, and `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0. If `dif1 <= dif2`, the following updates occur: if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif2`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, `b2` retains its value, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`. If `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 <= dif2`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `a1` is now less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1` retains its value, `b2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`. If `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 > dif2`, `a1` is decremented by 1, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`. If `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 <= dif2`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, and `b2` is decremented by 1. In all cases, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, and `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, and `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration unless `dif3 > dif1` or `dif4 > dif1` in the if part, or `dif4 > dif2` in the else part, in which case `a2` is decreased by 1. `b1` is increased by 1 in both the if and else parts. `b2` retains its value from the previous iteration unless `dif4 > dif1` in the if part or `dif4 > dif2` in the else part, in which case `b2` is decreased by 1. `ans` is updated based on the comparisons: if `dif1 > dif2` (if part), `ans` is increased by `dif3` if `dif3 > dif1`, otherwise by `dif1`, and if `dif4 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`; if `dif1 <= dif2` (else part), `ans` is increased by `dif3` if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif2`, by `dif2` if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 <= dif2`, by `dif4` if `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 > dif2`, and by `dif2` if `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 <= dif2`. `t` is updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` in both parts. The new values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the updated indices of arrays `a` and `b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
