Output State: **`dif2` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a1 + 1` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b1 + 1` of list `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `ans` is incremented by `dif1`; `a1` is incremented by 1; `b1` is incremented by 1.** 

The value of `b1` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `ans`, and `a1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
