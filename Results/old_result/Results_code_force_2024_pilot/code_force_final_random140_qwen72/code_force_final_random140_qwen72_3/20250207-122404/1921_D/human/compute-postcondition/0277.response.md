Postcondition: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, and `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration unless `dif3 > dif1` or `dif4 > dif1` in the if part, or `dif4 > dif2` in the else part, in which case `a2` is decreased by 1. `b1` is increased by 1 in both the if and else parts. `b2` retains its value from the previous iteration unless `dif4 > dif1` in the if part or `dif4 > dif2` in the else part, in which case `b2` is decreased by 1. `ans` is updated based on the comparisons: if `dif1 > dif2` (if part), `ans` is increased by `dif3` if `dif3 > dif1`, otherwise by `dif1`, and if `dif4 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`; if `dif1 <= dif2` (else part), `ans` is increased by `dif3` if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif2`, by `dif2` if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 <= dif2`, by `dif4` if `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 > dif2`, and by `dif2` if `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 <= dif2`. `t` is updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` in both parts. The new values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the updated indices of arrays `a` and `b`.**
