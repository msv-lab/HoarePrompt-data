Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles multiple test cases, sorts the arrays `a` and `b`, and then iteratively selects the elements from `b` that maximize the absolute differences with the elements in `a`. The logic ensures that the maximum possible difference is achieved by comparing the differences between the smallest and largest elements of both arrays and selecting the maximum difference at each step. This approach guarantees that the total difference `D` is maximized. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input within the constraints specified in the problem description.
