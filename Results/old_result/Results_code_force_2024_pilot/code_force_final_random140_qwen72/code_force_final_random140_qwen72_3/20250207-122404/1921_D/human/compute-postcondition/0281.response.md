The value of `t` is decremented by 1. All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Since `t` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, `t` is now `t - 1`.

Output State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration, and `t` is `t - 1`.**
