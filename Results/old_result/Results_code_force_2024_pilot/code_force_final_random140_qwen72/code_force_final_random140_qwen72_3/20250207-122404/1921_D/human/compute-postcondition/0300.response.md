The code snippet `ans += dif3` adds the value of `dif3` to the current value of `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is 0
- `a2` is `n - 1`
- `b1` is 0
- `b2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input
- `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input
- `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`
- `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`
- `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`
- `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`
- `dif1` is greater than `dif2`
- `dif3` is greater than `dif1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to `0 + dif3`, which means `ans` is now equal to `dif3`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif3`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, `dif3` is greater than `dif1`.**
