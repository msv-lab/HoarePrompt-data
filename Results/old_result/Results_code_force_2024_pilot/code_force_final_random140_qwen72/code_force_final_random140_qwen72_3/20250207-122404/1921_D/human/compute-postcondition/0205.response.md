Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, then: if `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif1`, `a1` remains 0, `a2` becomes `n - 2`, `b1` becomes 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif3`, and `t` is decremented by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0); if `dif3 > dif4`, but `dif3 <= dif1`, `a1` becomes 1, `a2` remains `n - 1`, `b1` becomes 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `t` is decremented by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0); if `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif4`; if `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 <= dif1`, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif1`. If `dif1 <= dif2`, then: if `dif3 > dif4`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3`; if `dif3 <= dif4`, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif2`. In all cases, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their original definitions and relationships as specified in the precondition.***
