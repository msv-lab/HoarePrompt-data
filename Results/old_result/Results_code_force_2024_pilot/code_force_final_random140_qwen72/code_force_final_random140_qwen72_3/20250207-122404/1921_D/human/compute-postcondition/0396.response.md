The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a1` is `a1 + 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, `b1` is `b1 + 1`.**
