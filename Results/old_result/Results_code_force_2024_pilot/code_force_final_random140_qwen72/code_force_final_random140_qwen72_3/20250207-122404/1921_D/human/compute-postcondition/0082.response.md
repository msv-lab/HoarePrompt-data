The code snippet `ans += dif1` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif1`. However, `dif1` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. The other variables (`dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dif2` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a1` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b1` of list `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `ans` is increased by the value of `dif1`.**
