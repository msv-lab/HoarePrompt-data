The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`, and assigns this value to `dif3`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is 0
- `a2` is `n - 1`
- `b1` is 0
- `b2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input
- `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input
- `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`
- `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`

After executing the code snippet:
- `dif3` is assigned the value `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`.**
