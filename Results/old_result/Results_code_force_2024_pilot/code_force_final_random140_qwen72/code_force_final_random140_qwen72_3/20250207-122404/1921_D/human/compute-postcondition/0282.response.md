The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial values to the new values provided by the input.

- `a1` was initially `n`, but now `n` has a new value from the input.
- `a2` was initially `n - 1`, but since `n` has changed, `a2` will also be updated to the new value of `n - 1`.
- `b1` was initially `m`, but now `m` has a new value from the input.
- `b2` was initially `m - 1`, but since `m` has changed, `b2` will also be updated to the new value of `m - 1`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is the new value of `n`, `a2` is the new value of `n - 1`, `b1` is the new value of `m`, `b2` is the new value of `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration, and `t` is `t - 1`.**
