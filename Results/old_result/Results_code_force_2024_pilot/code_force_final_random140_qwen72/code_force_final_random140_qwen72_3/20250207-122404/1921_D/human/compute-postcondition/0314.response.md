The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, and it is specified that `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, the new value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` (which is 0) plus `dif1`.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`. Additionally, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, and `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif1`.**
