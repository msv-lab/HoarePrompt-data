Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1` is now `a1 + 1`; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time; `ans` is increased by `dif2`.**
