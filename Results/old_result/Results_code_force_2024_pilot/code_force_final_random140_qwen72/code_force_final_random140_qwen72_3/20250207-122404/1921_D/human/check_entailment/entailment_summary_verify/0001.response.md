### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted. Sorting `a` helps in comparing elements in a structured manner, and sorting `b` allows us to consider the smallest and largest elements for maximizing the absolute differences. This is a crucial step in ensuring that we can efficiently find the maximum differences.

3. **Initialization**: The program initializes pointers `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` to manage the indices of the arrays `a` and `b`. It also initializes `ans` to store the total difference. These pointers help in traversing the arrays and selecting the appropriate elements to maximize the differences.

4. **Maximizing Differences**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through the elements of `a` and `b` and calculates the four possible differences:
   - `dif1`: Difference between the smallest element of `a` and the smallest element of `b`.
   - `dif2`: Difference between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `b`.
   - `dif3`: Difference between the largest element of `a` and the smallest element of `b`.
   - `dif4`: Difference between the largest element of `a` and the largest element of `b`.

5. **Choosing Maximum Difference**: The program then selects the maximum difference among these four and updates the corresponding pointers (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) to move to the next elements in the arrays. This ensures that the largest possible differences are always considered. The logic for choosing the maximum difference is implemented correctly, ensuring that the program always picks the best possible pair of elements to maximize the total difference.

6. **Output**: After processing all elements, the program prints the total difference `ans`. This is done for each test case, and the program handles multiple test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
The program follows a logical and efficient approach to maximize the total difference `D` by considering all possible differences and selecting the maximum one at each step. The use of sorting and pointer manipulation ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct for the given problem constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: **True**
