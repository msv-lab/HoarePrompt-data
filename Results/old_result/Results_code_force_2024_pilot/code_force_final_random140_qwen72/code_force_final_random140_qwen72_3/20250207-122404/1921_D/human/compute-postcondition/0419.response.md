The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple inputs related to test cases, including the number of test cases (`t`), the sizes of two lists (`n` and `m`), and the lists themselves (`a_i` and `b_i`). However, without the actual function signature showing these parameters, I will describe the functionality based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the sizes of two lists, and two lists `a_i` and `b_i` of integers (where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, with the constraint that the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
