Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration (decremented by 1), `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` as described, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`.** 

Explanation:
- `a2` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `a2 - 1`.
- The condition `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` is updated to `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`.
- All other conditions and updates remain as described in the initial state, with the updated value of `a2`.
