The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is `n`
- `a2` is `-1`
- `b1` is `m`
- `b2` is `-1`
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic
- `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0)
- `n` is the first integer from input
- `m` is the second integer from input
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `b` is updated to a list of integers from the new input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `-1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `-1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic, `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0), `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input.**
