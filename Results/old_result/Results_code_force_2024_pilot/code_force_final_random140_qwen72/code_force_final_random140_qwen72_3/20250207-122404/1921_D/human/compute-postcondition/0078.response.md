Postcondition: ***`dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences as initially defined. If `dif3` > `dif1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b1` is incremented by 1.***
