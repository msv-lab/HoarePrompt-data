Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparison between `dif4` and `dif1`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif1`, then `a1` remains 0, `a2` is updated to `n - 2`, `b1` remains 0, `b2` is updated to `m - 2`, `ans` is set to `dif4`, and `t` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif1`, then `a1` is updated to 1, `a2` remains `n - 1`, `b1` is updated to 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `t` is decremented by 1. The lists `a` and `b` remain sorted, and the relationships between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` as specified in the precondition are preserved.***
