Output State: **`dif2` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a1` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.** 

This means that the value of `dif2` is now calculated as the absolute difference between the element at the index `a1` in the list `a` and the element at the index `b2` in the list `b`. The rest of the initial state remains the same, including the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, the lists `a` and `b`, the values of `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, and the values of `a1` and `a2`.
