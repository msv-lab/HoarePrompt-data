Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif2`, `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0), `n` is the first integer from input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`. Additionally, `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`. Furthermore, `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif2`.**
