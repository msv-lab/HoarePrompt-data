Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the total difference \(D\) between two arrays \(a\) and \(c\), where \(c\) is constructed from a subset of \(b\) with the same length as \(a\). The approach taken by the program involves sorting both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) and then iteratively selecting the elements that maximize the absolute difference.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\), followed by the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Sorting**: Both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) are sorted. Sorting helps in efficiently finding the maximum absolute differences by comparing the smallest and largest elements of the sorted arrays.

3. **Iterative Selection**: The program uses four pointers (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) to track the current positions in the sorted arrays \(a\) and \(b\). It calculates the absolute differences between the current elements of \(a\) and the boundary elements of \(b\) (i.e., the smallest and largest elements of \(b\)).

4. **Maximizing Differences**: The program compares the four possible differences and selects the maximum one. It then updates the pointers accordingly to move to the next elements in the arrays.

5. **Summing Differences**: The selected maximum difference is added to the total sum `ans`.

6. **Output**: After processing all elements in \(a\), the program prints the total sum `ans` for the current test case.

The logic ensures that the program always selects the pair of elements that maximizes the absolute difference at each step, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the total difference \(D\).

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the program appears to handle all edge cases and constraints correctly. The sorting and pointer-based approach is efficient and appropriate for the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.
