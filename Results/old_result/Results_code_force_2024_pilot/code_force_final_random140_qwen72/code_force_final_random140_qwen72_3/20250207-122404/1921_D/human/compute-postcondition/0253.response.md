Postcondition: ***`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration unless `dif3 > dif1`, in which case `a2` is decreased by 1. `b1` is increased by 1 in both cases. `b2` retains its value from the previous iteration. `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3` if `dif3 > dif1`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif1`. `t` is updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` in both cases. `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif3 > dif1`, `dif3` becomes the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b1]`, and `dif4` becomes the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2]`.***
