The value of `b2` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is now `a1 + 1`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, `b2` is now `b2 - 1`.**
