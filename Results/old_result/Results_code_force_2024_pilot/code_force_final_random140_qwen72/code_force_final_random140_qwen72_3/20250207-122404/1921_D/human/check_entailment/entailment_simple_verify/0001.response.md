### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted. Sorting `a` helps in comparing elements in a structured manner, and sorting `b` allows us to consider the smallest and largest elements for maximizing the absolute differences.

3. **Initialization**: The program initializes pointers `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` to manage the indices of the arrays `a` and `b`. It also initializes `ans` to store the total difference.

4. **Maximizing Differences**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through the elements of `a` and `b` and calculates the four possible differences:
   - `dif1`: Difference between the smallest element of `a` and the smallest element of `b`.
   - `dif2`: Difference between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `b`.
   - `dif3`: Difference between the largest element of `a` and the smallest element of `b`.
   - `dif4`: Difference between the largest element of `a` and the largest element of `b`.

5. **Choosing Maximum Difference**: The program then selects the maximum difference among these four and updates the corresponding pointers (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) to move to the next elements in the arrays. This ensures that the largest possible differences are always considered.

6. **Output**: After processing all elements, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: The program starts with `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
- **Sorting**: Both `a` and `b` are sorted, ensuring that the elements are in non-decreasing order.
- **Pointer Initialization**: Pointers `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are initialized to manage the indices of the arrays.
- **While Loop**: The loop runs until all elements of `a` are processed. Inside the loop, the program calculates the four possible differences and selects the maximum one.
- **Pointer Updates**: Depending on the selected maximum difference, the pointers are updated to move to the next elements in the arrays.
- **Final State**: After processing all elements, the total difference `ans` is printed.

### Conclusion:

The program follows a logical and efficient approach to maximize the total difference `D` by considering all possible differences and selecting the maximum one at each step. The use of sorting and pointer manipulation ensures that the solution is correct and handles the given problem constraints effectively.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: **True**
