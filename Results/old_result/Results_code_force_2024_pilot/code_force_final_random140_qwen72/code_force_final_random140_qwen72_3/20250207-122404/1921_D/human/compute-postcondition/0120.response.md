Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1` is increased by 1; `b1` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. This affects the calculation of `dif1` and `dif3`, which now use `b[b1+1]` instead of `b[b1]`. The other variables remain unchanged except for the updated value of `b1`.
