Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b1` is 0; `b2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The lists `a` and `b` are both sorted.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state.
