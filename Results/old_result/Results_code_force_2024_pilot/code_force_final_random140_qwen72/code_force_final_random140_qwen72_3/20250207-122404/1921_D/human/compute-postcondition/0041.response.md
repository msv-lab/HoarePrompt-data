Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`; `dif1 > dif2` is true. If `dif3 > dif4`, then: if `dif3 > dif1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3`. Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif1`. If `dif3 ≤ dif4`, then: if `dif4 > dif1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif4`. Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif1`.***
