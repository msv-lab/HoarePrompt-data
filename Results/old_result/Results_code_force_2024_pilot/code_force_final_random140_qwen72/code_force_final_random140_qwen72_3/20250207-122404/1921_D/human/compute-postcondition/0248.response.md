Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration (now decreased by 1), `b1`, `b2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2]`.**
