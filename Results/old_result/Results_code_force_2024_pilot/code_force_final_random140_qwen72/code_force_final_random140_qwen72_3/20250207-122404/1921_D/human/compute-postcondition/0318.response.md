Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their initial properties as described in the precondition. If `dif3` > `dif4`: 
- If `dif3` > `dif1`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif3`, and `t` is `t - 1`.
- Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif1`, and `t` is `t - 1`.
If `dif3` ≤ `dif4`:
- If `dif4` > `dif1`, then `a1` remains 0, `a2` is updated to `n - 2`, `b1` remains 0, `b2` is updated to `m - 2`, `ans` is set to `dif4`, and `t` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, if `dif4` ≤ `dif1`, then `a1` is updated to 1, `a2` remains `n - 1`, `b1` is updated to 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `t` is decremented by 1. The lists `a` and `b` remain sorted, and the relationships between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` as specified in the precondition are preserved.***
