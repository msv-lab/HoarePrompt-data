Postcondition: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif4` > `dif1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + abs(a[a1-1] - b[b1-1])`, and `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0. In both cases, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, and `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**
