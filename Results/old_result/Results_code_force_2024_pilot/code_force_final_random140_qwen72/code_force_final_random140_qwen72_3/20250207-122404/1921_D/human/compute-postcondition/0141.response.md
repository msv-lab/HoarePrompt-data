The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was greater than 0, but since the exact value of `t` is not specified, we assume it has been decremented by 1 (as is common in such loops). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `-1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic, and `t` must be greater than 0**
