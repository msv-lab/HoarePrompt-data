Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `dif1` is now the absolute difference between the elements at the indices `a1` and `b1` in the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
