The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99.
- `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.

After executing the code:
- The variable `b` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of integers input by the user; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
