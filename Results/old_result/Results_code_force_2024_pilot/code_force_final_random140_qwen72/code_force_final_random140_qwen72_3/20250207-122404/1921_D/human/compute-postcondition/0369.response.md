Postcondition: **`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`. If `dif3 > dif2`, `a1` and `b1` are increased by 1, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`. `a2`, `b1`, and `t` remain unchanged in both cases.**
