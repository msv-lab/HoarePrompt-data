Postcondition: ***`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration unless `dif3 > dif1` or `dif4 > dif1`, in which case `a2` is decreased by 1. `b1` is increased by 1 in both cases. `b2` retains its value from the previous iteration unless `dif4 > dif1`, in which case `b2` is decreased by 1. `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3` if `dif3 > dif1`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif1`. If `dif4 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `dif1`. `t` is updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` in both cases. The new values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the updated indices of arrays `a` and `b`.***
