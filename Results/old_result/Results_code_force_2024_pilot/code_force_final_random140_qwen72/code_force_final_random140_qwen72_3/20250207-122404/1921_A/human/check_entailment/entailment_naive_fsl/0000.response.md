Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. Specifically, it calculates the squared distance between two points and prints the smaller of two such distances, which is not the correct approach to finding the area of the square.

A correct approach would involve identifying the side length of the square by finding the minimum difference in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates among the given points, and then squaring this value to get the area. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

The program outputs `2` instead of `4`, which is incorrect. The correct side length of the square is 2, and thus the area should be \(2^2 = 4\).
