Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates two distances: one between the first and second pair of coordinates, and another between the first and third pair of coordinates. It then prints the smaller of these two squared distances. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result directly to the console. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any global state or variables outside its scope. **
