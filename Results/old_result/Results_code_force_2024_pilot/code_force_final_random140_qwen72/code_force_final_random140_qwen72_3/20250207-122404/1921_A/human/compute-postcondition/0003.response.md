Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `c` and `d`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
