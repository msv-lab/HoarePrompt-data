Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take no arguments directly but should be designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, and `t` is now assigned the value of an input integer. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
    x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are new input integers, `e` and `f` are new input integers, `g` and `h` are new input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `c` and `d` are new input integers, `g` and `h` are new input integers, `e` and `f` are new input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
