t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test_case in test_cases is a list of four tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
