Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `steps` is 0.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers.
   - `c` and `d` are input integers.
   - `e` and `f` are input integers.
   - `g` and `h` are input integers.
   - `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).
   - `x` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
   - It is given that `x` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n)`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `n` is the result of the formula \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).
   - This formula calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `n`, which is the squared Euclidean distance between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).

Given the initial state, the value of `n` is explicitly defined by the formula \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).

Output: **n (where n is the squared Euclidean distance between the points (a, b) and (c, d))**
