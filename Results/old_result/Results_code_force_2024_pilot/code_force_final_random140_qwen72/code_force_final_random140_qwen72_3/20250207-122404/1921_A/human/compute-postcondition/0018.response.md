The code snippet `g, h = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `g` and `h`.

- The initial state includes the variables `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `n`, and `x`, with their respective values and conditions.
- The values of `g` and `h` are updated based on the new input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are new input integers, `e` and `f` are new input integers, `g` and `h` are new input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
