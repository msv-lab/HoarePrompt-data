The function `func` does not accept any direct parameters. However, it is designed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and the coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The function processes these test cases and returns the area of each square.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of each square.**
