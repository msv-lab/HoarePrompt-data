Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`. If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The values of `t`, `steps`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition `If x > n, then x is greater than n. Otherwise, x is less than or equal to n.` remains valid as it depends on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`, which are still part of the state.
