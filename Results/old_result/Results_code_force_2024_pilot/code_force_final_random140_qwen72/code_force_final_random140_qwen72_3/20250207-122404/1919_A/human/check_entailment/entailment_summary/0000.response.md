Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem statement, the game involves a series of moves where each player can either swap wallets or keep their own, followed by removing one coin from their wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategy for both players.

The provided solution simply compares the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`n` and `k`) and decides the winner based on which is larger. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the dynamic nature of the game, where the number of coins changes with each move.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) will always win because she can always force the game into a state where Bob is left with an even number of coins, making it impossible for Bob to win. Conversely, if the total number of coins is even, Bob will win because he can always mirror Alice's moves until she is forced to lose.

Given this, the correct logic should be:
- If `(a + b) % 2 == 1`, Alice wins.
- If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, Bob wins.

The provided solution does not account for this logic, and thus it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
