The only object in the loop head is the variable `_rep` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_rep` is used as a placeholder and is not relevant to the state outside the loop.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_rep` will start from 0 (as it is the default behavior of `range()`).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_rep` is 0**
