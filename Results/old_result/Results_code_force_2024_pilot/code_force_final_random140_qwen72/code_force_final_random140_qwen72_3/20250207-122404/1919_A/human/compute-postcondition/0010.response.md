Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `_rep` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input, and `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.***
