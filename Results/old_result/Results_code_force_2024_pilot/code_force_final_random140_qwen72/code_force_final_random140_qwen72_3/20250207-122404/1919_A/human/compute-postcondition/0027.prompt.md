Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _rep in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n > k:
        print('Bob')
    elif n < k:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_rep` is 0, and `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input. If `n` > `k`, the current value of `n` is greater than the current value of `k`. If `n` ≤ `k`, the current value of `n` is either less than or equal to the current value of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, and `n` and `k` are new integers provided by user input, regardless of the initial values of `n` and `k` or their relationship.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_rep is 2, t is greater than 2, n and k are integers provided by user input. If n > k, no changes are made to the variables. If n < k, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
