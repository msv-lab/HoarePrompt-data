Output State: **_rep is t-1, t is the initial value of t, and for each iteration, n and k were integers provided by user input. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final value of _rep is one less than the initial value of t. No changes were made to the variables n and k within the loop, but their values were used to determine the output for each iteration.**
