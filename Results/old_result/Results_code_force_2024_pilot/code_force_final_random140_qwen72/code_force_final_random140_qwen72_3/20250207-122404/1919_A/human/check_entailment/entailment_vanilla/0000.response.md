### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the other or keep their own.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If Alice starts with more coins than Bob (`a > b`), she can always force Bob into a position where he has fewer coins.
   - If Bob starts with more coins than Alice (`b > a`), he can similarly force Alice into a position where she has fewer coins.
   - If both start with the same number of coins (`a == b`), the game will end in a draw if both play optimally, but since the game rules state that the player who cannot make a move loses, the player who makes the last move will lose. This means the player who starts (Alice) will lose if both have the same number of coins.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then compares `n` and `k`:
     - If `n > k`, it prints "Bob" because Alice will eventually be forced into a losing position.
     - If `n < k`, it prints "Alice" because Bob will eventually be forced into a losing position.
     - If `n == k`, it prints "Bob" because Alice will be the one to make the last move and thus lose.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the input `(1, 1)`, both have the same number of coins, so Alice will lose. The program correctly outputs "Bob".
   - For the input `(1, 4)`, Alice has fewer coins, so she will win. The program correctly outputs "Alice".
   - For the input `(5, 3)`, Alice has more coins, so Bob will win. The program correctly outputs "Bob".
   - For the input `(4, 5)`, Bob has more coins, so Alice will win. The program correctly outputs "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.
