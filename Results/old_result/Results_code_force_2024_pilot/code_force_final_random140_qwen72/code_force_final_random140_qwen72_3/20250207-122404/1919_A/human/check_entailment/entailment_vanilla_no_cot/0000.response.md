Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The solution simply compares the number of coins `n` and `k` and decides the winner based on which is larger. However, the game involves strategic decisions about swapping wallets and removing coins, which means the outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins and the sequence of moves.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Condition**: If both players start with the same number of coins, the game will always end in a draw where the player whose turn it is when both wallets are empty loses. Since Alice goes first, she will lose if both wallets start with the same number of coins.

2. **Odd and Even Coins**: If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with more coins can force the other player into a losing position by always keeping the number of coins in their wallet odd. This is because the player with the odd number of coins can always make a move that leaves the opponent with an even number of coins, eventually leading to a situation where the opponent cannot make a move.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This solution correctly handles the cases where the number of coins is the same and where the total number of coins is even or odd, ensuring the correct winner is determined based on the game rules.
