You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _rep in range(t):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n > k:
            print('Bob')
        elif n < k:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _rep in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n > k:
            print('Bob')
        elif n < k:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
        
    #State: _rep is t-1, t is the initial value of t, and for each iteration, n and k were integers provided by user input. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final value of _rep is one less than the initial value of t. No changes were made to the variables n and k within the loop, but their values were used to determine the output for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^9). It then compares `n` and `k` and prints 'Bob' if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 'Alice' if `n` is less than `k`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the completion of all test cases, with no modifications to the input variables `n` and `k` beyond their use in the comparison.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program simply compares the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and decides the winner based on which player has fewer coins initially. This approach fails to account for the game's rules, particularly the alternating moves and the option to swap wallets.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

- Input: `t = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 4`
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Program Output: `Bob`

According to the game rules, Alice can win by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, reducing the number of coins in her wallet to 3 and leaving Bob with 1 coin. Bob will then be forced to remove a coin, leaving him with 0 coins, and thus unable to make a move. Therefore, Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs `Bob` because it does not simulate the game correctly.
