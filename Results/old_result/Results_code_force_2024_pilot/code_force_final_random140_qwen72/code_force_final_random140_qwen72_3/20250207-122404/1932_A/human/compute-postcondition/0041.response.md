Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `ret` is the number of '@' characters encountered before two consecutive '*' characters, and `thorn` is 2 if two consecutive '*' characters are found, otherwise it is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is updated to be a list of characters from the new input string.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `len`, `ret`, `thorn`) retain their original values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
