Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The variable `len` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts user input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
