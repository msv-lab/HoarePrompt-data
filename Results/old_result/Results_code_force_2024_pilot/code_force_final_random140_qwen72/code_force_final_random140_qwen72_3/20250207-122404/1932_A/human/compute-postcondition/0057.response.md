Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not '@', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0 unless `i` is '*', in which case `thorn` is 1 or 2. If `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
