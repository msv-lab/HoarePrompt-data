Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the first character in `s`, and `i` is not equal to '*'**

The code snippet `thorn = 0` does not change the value of `thorn` because it was already initialized to 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
