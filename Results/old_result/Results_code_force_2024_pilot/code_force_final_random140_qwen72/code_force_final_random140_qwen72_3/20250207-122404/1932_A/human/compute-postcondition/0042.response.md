Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2 if two consecutive '*' characters are found, otherwise it is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ret` to 0. This changes the value of `ret` from its initial state (which was the number of '@' characters encountered before two consecutive '*' characters) to 0. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `len`, `s`, and `thorn`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
