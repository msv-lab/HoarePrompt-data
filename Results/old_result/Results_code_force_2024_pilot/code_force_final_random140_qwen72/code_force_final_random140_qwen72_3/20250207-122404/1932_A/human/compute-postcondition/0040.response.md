Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is the number of '@' characters encountered before two consecutive '*' characters, and `thorn` is 2 if two consecutive '*' characters are found, otherwise it is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `len` to the new input integer provided by the user. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn`) remain unchanged. The new value of `len` is now the integer input by the user.
