Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not '@' and `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ret` remains 0 and `thorn` remains 0.***
