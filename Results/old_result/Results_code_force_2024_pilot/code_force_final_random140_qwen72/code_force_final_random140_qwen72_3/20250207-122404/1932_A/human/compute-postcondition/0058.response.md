The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in `s` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, and `i` is the first character in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `i` will be the second character in `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not '@', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0 unless `i` is '*', in which case `thorn` is 1 or 2. If `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
