Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not '@' and not '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', and `thorn` was 0 or 1, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 2. If `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
