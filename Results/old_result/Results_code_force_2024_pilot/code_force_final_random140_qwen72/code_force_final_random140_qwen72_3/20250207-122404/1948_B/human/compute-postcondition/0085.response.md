The code `c.append(a[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the end of the list `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, `c` now contains the element at index `i` from `a` appended to its previous contents.**
