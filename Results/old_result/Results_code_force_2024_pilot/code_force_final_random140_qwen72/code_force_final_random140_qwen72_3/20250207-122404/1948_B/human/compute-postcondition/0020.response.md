Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, `c` is a list, `i` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than 10. If `y` <= `x`, then `n` is 2, `c` contains the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10 followed by `x`, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If `y` > `x`, then `n` is 1, `c` contains the element at index `i` in `a`, and `y` is greater than `x`. In both cases, the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10 (`y`) is greater than or equal to the element at index `n - 1` in `c`.***
