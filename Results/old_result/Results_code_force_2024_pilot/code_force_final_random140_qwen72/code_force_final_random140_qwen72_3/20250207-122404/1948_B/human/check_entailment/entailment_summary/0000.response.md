### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `m` and then processing each test case individually using the `func_1` function.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the processed elements.
   - It iterates through each element of the array `a` and processes elements greater than 10 by splitting them into their tens and units digits.
   - The conditions for appending the digits to `c` are:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and is not the first element, it checks if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit.
     - If the element is the first element and is greater than 10, it directly splits it and appends the digits to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element as is to `c`.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After processing the array, the function checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.

4. **Output**:
   - The main part of the program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' if the value is 1, indicating that the array can be sorted, and 'NO' if the value is 0, indicating that the array cannot be sorted.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the input and applies the specified operations to transform the array.
- The logic for splitting the elements and checking the sorted order is implemented correctly.
- The program handles edge cases such as arrays with elements less than 10 and arrays that are already sorted.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
