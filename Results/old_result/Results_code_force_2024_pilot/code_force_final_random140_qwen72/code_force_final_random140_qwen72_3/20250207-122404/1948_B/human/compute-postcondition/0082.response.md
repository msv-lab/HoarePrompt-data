The code `c.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the list `c`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `c` is updated to include the new element `x` at the end of the list.
- `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `c` is a list containing its previous elements plus the value of `x` (where `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`), `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10.**
