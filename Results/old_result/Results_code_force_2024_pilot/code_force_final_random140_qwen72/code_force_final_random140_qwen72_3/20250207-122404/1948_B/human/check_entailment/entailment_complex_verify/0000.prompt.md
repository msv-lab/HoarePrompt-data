You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the total number of elements in the list `c`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, and `c` is a list of integers. The list `c` contains the processed elements from `a` according to the rules defined in the loop. For each element in `a` that is greater than 10 and not the first element, it is split into its tens and units digits (`y` and `x`), and these are added to `c` based on the conditions specified. If the element is the first element or less than or equal to 10, it is added directly to `c`.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the total number of elements in the list `c`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `c` is a list of integers, `d` is a sorted version of `c`. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list that includes the integer 1. Otherwise, `b` is a list with one element which is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It then processes the list `a` by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits and appending them to a new list `c` based on specific conditions. After processing, it checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `b` to contain the results of the test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few specific cases where the program fails:

1. **Handling of Input and Output**:
   - The function `func_1` is called before the list `b` is defined, which can lead to errors.
   - The list `b` is used to store results, but it is not initialized before the loop where it is used.

2. **Logic for Splitting Numbers**:
   - The program only splits numbers greater than 10 into their digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, it does not consider all possible operations that can be performed on the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program should be able to split `12` into `[1, 2]`, `45` into `[4, 5]`, and `67` into `[6, 7]`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted. However, the program does not handle this correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where all elements are less than 10.
   - For example, the array `[0, 0]` should return `YES` because it is already sorted, but the program may not handle this correctly.

4. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The program splits numbers greater than 10 but does not always ensure that the resulting array is checked for sorting after all possible splits.
   - For example, the array `[12, 28, 5]` should return `NO` because it cannot be sorted by splitting any of the numbers, but the program may not correctly identify this.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
