Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few specific cases where the program fails:

1. **Handling of Input and Output**:
   - The function `func_1` is called before the list `b` is defined, which can lead to errors.
   - The list `b` is used to store results, but it is not initialized before the loop where it is used.

2. **Logic for Splitting Numbers**:
   - The program only splits numbers greater than 10 into their digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, it does not consider all possible operations that can be performed on the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program should be able to split `12` into `[1, 2]`, `45` into `[4, 5]`, and `67` into `[6, 7]`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted. However, the program does not handle this correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where all elements are less than 10.
   - For example, the array `[0, 0]` should return `YES` because it is already sorted, but the program may not handle this correctly.

4. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The program splits numbers greater than 10 but does not always ensure that the resulting array is checked for sorting after all possible splits.
   - For example, the array `[12, 28, 5]` should return `NO` because it cannot be sorted by splitting any of the numbers, but the program may not correctly identify this.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
