Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which would result in a runtime error in Python.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits**: The logic for splitting numbers into their digits and inserting them back into the array is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the conditions for appending `y` and `x` to the list `c` are overly complex and do not handle all cases correctly.

3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the modified array `c` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version `d`. However, this approach does not account for the possibility that the array might become sorted after multiple operations, as the problem allows for any number of operations.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the array is already sorted or when all elements are less than 10.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Correctly split numbers into their digits.
- Check if the resulting array can be sorted after performing the operations.
- Ensure the function is defined before it is called.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Function to split a number into its digits
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    # Split all numbers greater than 10 into their digits
    new_a = []
    for num in a:
        if num >= 10:
            new_a.extend(split_number(num))
        else:
            new_a.append(num)
    
    # Check if the new array is sorted
    return new_a == sorted(new_a)

m = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results.append(can_be_sorted(a))

for result in results:
    print('YES' if result else 'NO')
```

This version correctly handles the splitting of numbers and checks if the resulting array can be sorted.
