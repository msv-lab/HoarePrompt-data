Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the remainder when the first element of `a` is divided by 10, `y` is the integer division result of the first element of `a` by 10, `c` is a list, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is greater than 10. If `y` <= `x`, then `n` is 2 and `c` contains `[y, x]`. If `y` > `x`, then `n` is 1 and `c` contains `[a[0]]`.***
