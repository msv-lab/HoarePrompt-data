Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, `c` is a list, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, and `c` now contains the value of `y` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `c`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10.
- The value of `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`.
- The list `c` now includes the value of `y` as its last element.
