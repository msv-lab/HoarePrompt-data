You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It then processes the list `a` by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits and appending them to a new list `c` based on specific conditions. After processing, it checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `b` to contain the results of the test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array itself `a`.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates over the elements of the array `a`.

3. **Transformation Logic**:
   - For each element in the array:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
       - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
       - If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - After transforming the array, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the transformed list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to `b` (indicating a successful transformation).
   - Otherwise, it appends 0 to `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates over the results in `b` and prints 'YES' for 1 and 'NO' for 0.

### Correctness:
- The logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted condition seems correct.
- However, there is a potential issue with the way the digits are split and appended. Specifically, the division `y = int(a[i] / 10)` should use integer division `y = a[i] // 10` to ensure `y` is an integer.
- Additionally, the logic for appending digits to `c` could be simplified and made more robust.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues mentioned, the overall logic and structure of the program are correct and should work for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
