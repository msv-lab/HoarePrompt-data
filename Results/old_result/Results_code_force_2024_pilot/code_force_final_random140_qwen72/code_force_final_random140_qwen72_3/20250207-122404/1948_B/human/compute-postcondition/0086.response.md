The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` was either 1 or 2, it is now either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 2 or 3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, `c` now contains the element at index `i` from `a` appended to its previous contents.**
