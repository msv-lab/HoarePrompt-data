The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is either 1 or 2
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one element
- `i` is 2 or greater than 2
- `c` is a list containing its previous elements plus the value of `y`
- `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`
- `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10

After executing `c.append(x)`, the value of `x` is added to the end of the list `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `c` is a list containing its previous elements plus the value of `y` and the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10.**
