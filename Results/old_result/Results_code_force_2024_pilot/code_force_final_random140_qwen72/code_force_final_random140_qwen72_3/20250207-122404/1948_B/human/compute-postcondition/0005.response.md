Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0.** 

The variable `y` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) retain their initial values.
