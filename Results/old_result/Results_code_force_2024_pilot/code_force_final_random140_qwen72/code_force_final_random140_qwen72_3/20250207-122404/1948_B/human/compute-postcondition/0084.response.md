The value of `n` is incremented by 2. Since `n` was initially either 1 or 2, after the increment, `n` will be either 3 or 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 3 or 4, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `c` is a list containing its previous elements plus the value of `y` and the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10.**
