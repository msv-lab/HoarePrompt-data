The function `thing()` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be assumed that the function operates within a context where it can access or receive multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function should process each test case to determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the specified operation.
