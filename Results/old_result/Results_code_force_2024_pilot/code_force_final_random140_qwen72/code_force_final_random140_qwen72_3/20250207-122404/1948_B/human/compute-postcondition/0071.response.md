Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `c` is a list containing the original elements plus `y` and `x`, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10.**

Explanation:
- The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`.
- The value of `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- The value of `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 10.
- Since `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `c` already contains the original elements plus `y`.
- After appending `x` to `c`, `c` now contains the original elements plus `y` and `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.
