Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is 2 or 3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, `c` is a list that now includes the element at index `i` from the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so if `n` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 2, it becomes 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
