The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but is expected to handle multiple test cases. The input to the function is implicitly defined through the problem statement, where `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 <= a_i <= 99). The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case.

However, since the specific output for each test case is not provided in the problem statement, I will assume that the function processes the list of integers in some way relevant to the problem's context (e.g., finding a specific value, performing a calculation, etc.).

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns the result for each test case.**
