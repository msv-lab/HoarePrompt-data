The code appends a string to the `results` list. This string is created by converting each element in the `res` list to a string and joining them with a space. The `res` list contains the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.

Therefore, the `results` list, which was initially empty, now contains one string element. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.**
