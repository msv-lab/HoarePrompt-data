Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the new input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the new input, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the `res` list to contain the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `results`, `remaining_players`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `res` is a list where each element corresponds to the element in `remaining_players` at the index specified by the corresponding element in `qs`.
