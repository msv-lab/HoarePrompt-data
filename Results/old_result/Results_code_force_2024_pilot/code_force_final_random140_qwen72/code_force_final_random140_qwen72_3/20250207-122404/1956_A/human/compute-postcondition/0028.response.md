The only variables in the loop head are `n` and `max_n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n` being less than or equal to `max_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 2 and `max_n` is 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `max_n` must still be 100.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 0.**
