Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` string elements, where each element is a space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for each iteration. Here, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, and `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs` for the last iteration. `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, where `p` is a list of integers read from the input.**
