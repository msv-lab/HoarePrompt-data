To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Current State:
- `p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100.
- `max_n` is 100.
- `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0.
- `n` is 3.
- `cur_n` is 3 - `count`.
- `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3.

### Loop Condition:
```
while cur_n >= min(p):
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
- `cur_n` is calculated as `3 - count`.
- `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine `min(p)`**: Since `p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `min(p)` is the first element of `p`, i.e., `p[0]`.
2. **Determine `count`**: `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3. If `p` is sorted and contains elements greater than 3, `count` will be the index of the smallest element in `p` that is greater than 3.
3. **Calculate `cur_n`**: `cur_n` is `3 - count`. For the loop to execute again, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`.
4. **Adjust States**: We need to ensure that `cur_n` is still greater than or equal to `min(p)` after the adjustment.

### Adjustments:
- `cur_n` is `3 - count`. To ensure the loop continues, `3 - count` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`.
- Since `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3, `count` must be such that `3 - count` is non-negative and greater than or equal to `min(p)`.

### Conclusion:
- If `min(p)` is 1 (the smallest possible value in `p`), then `count` must be 2 or less for `cur_n` to be non-negative.
- If `min(p)` is greater than 1, `count` must be adjusted accordingly to ensure `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`.

### Final State:
Since `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3, and `p` is sorted, the smallest possible value for `min(p)` is 1. Therefore, `count` must be 2 or less for the loop to execute again.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 3 - `count`; `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3 and must be 2 or less**.
