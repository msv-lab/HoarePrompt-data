Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 3; `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module finds the insertion point for `cur_n` (which is 3) in the sorted list `p`. This insertion point is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3. The value of `count` is set to this index. All other variables remain unchanged.
