Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters but reads input values for `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it uses the lists `p` and `qs` to generate a list `res` of elements from `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`. The final output is a list `results` containing `t` string elements, each a space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for the corresponding test case.**
