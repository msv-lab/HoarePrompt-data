The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder in the `range(t)` loop. This means that the loop iterates `t` times, and the value of `_` is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and the loop counter (represented by `_`) should increment by 1.

However, since `_` is not used and does not affect the state, the only relevant change is that the loop counter has moved to the next iteration. The value of `t` itself does not change; it is the number of iterations remaining that decreases by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.** 

Note: Since the loop counter `_` is not used, it does not need to be explicitly stated in the state. The only implicit change is that the loop has moved to the next iteration.
