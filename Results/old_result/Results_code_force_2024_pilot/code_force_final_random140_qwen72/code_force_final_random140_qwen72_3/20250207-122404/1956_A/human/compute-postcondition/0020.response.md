Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 249, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the new input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the new input, `results` is a list containing two string elements: the first element is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, and the second element is the same as the first element, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by the new `qs`. `k` and `q` are now updated to the values read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `remaining_players = func_1(p)` updates the `remaining_players` variable to the result of calling `func_1` with the list `p`.
- The initial state already specifies that `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, so this part remains unchanged.
- The initial state also mentions that `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by the new `qs`. This part remains valid as well.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `results` remain unchanged by this code snippet.
- The values of `k` and `q` are updated to the values read from the input, which is mentioned in the initial state.

Thus, the output state reflects these changes and retains the other initial conditions.
