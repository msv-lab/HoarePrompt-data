### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves simulating a game where players are removed based on a sequence of positions. The goal is to determine how many players remain after the game ends for different initial numbers of players.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial player counts (from 1 to 100).
   - It iterates over each possible number of players `n` and simulates the removal process until no more players can be removed.
   - The `bisect.bisect_right` function is used to efficiently find the number of players to remove in each round.
   - The result is stored in the `remaining_players` list, which is returned at the end.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the precomputed results for the sequence `p`.
   - It then constructs the result for each initial player count in `qs` using the precomputed results and appends the results to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the answers for all test cases.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process and precomputes the results.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and uses the precomputed results to generate the final output.
   - The use of `bisect.bisect_right` ensures efficient computation of the number of players to remove in each round.
   - The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.
