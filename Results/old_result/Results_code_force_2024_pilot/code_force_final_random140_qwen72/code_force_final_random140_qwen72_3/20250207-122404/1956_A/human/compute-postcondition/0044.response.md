The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `p`, which is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer in `p` satisfies 1 <= p[i] <= 100. The function returns a list `remaining_players` of 101 integers. Each element `remaining_players[n]` (for 1 <= n <= 100) represents the largest value less than the minimum value in `p` after subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. The first element of the list (index 0) is not used.
