The function `func_2` reads input values for `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` to process `t` test cases. For each test case, it generates a list `res` by selecting elements from the list `remaining_players` (which is the result of calling `func_1(p)`) at the indices specified by `qs`. The function returns a list `results` containing `t` string elements, where each element is a space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for the corresponding test case.
