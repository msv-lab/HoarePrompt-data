Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0, `remaining_players[2]` set to 0, and `remaining_players[3]` set to `cur_n`; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is the largest value less than the minimum value in `p`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `remaining_players[n]` is updated to `cur_n`, where `n` is 3.
- Since `cur_n` is the largest value less than the minimum value in `p`, `remaining_players[3]` is now set to this value.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
