### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a game where players are lined up, and certain players are removed based on a sequence `a` of indices.
   - The game continues until no more players can be removed.
   - We need to determine the number of winners for different initial numbers of players `n`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial numbers of players from 1 to 100.
     - It iterates over each possible number of players `n` and simulates the removal process.
     - For each `n`, it repeatedly removes players based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed.
     - The result is stored in the `remaining_players` array.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads the sequence `p` and the list of queries `qs`.
     - It uses the precomputed `remaining_players` array to quickly find the number of remaining players for each query.
     - The results are collected and returned as a list of strings.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Precomputation (`func_1`):**
     - The precomputation correctly simulates the removal process for each possible number of players.
     - The use of `bisect.bisect_right` ensures that the correct number of players are removed in each round.
   - **Query Processing (`func_2`):**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It uses the precomputed results to efficiently answer each query.
     - The output format matches the required format.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of winners for different initial numbers of players. The precomputation and query processing are both implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
