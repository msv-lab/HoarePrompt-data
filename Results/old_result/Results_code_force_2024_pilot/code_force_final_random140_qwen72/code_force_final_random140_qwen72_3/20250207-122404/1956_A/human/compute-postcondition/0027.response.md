Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 2; `cur_n` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code updates the `remaining_players` list by setting the value at index `n` (which is 2) to `cur_n` (which is 0). All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
