To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100.
   - `max_n` is 100.
   - `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0.
   - `n` is 3.
   - `cur_n` is 3 - 2*count.
   - `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`.
   - `count` is updated to the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `3 - 2*count`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `cur_n -= count`

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - First, we need to determine the value of `count`.
   - `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `3 - 2*count`.
   - Let's assume `count` is initially determined to be some value, say `k`.
   - Therefore, `cur_n` is initially `3 - 2*k`.
   - After the line `cur_n -= count`, `cur_n` becomes `3 - 2*k - k`, which simplifies to `3 - 3*k`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `p` remains a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100.
   - `max_n` remains 100.
   - `remaining_players` remains a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0.
   - `n` remains 3.
   - `cur_n` is now `3 - 3*count`.
   - `count` remains the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `3 - 2*count`.

Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is `3 - 3*count`; `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `3 - 2*count`.**
