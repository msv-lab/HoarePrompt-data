To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while cur_n >= min(p):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The condition `cur_n >= min(p)` involves two variables: `cur_n` and `min(p)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100.
   - `max_n` is 100.
   - `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0.
   - `n` is 3.
   - `cur_n` is 3 - 2*count.
   - `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `min(p)`.
   - `cur_n` is calculated as `3 - 2*count`.
   - `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `cur_n` must be at least `min(p)`.
   - Since `p` is sorted in ascending order, `min(p)` is the first element of `p`, i.e., `p[0]`.
   - Therefore, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `p[0]`.

6. **Adjusting `cur_n`:**
   - Given `cur_n = 3 - 2*count`, we need to ensure that `3 - 2*count >= p[0]`.
   - This implies that `count` must be such that `3 - 2*count >= p[0]`.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - If `p[0]` is the smallest element in `p`, and `cur_n` is calculated based on `count`, we need to ensure that `count` is adjusted appropriately to keep `cur_n` within the required range.
   - Since `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`, and `p` is sorted, `count` should be adjusted to ensure `cur_n` remains valid.

### Final State:
Given the current state, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time is `count`. However, since `count` is derived from the elements of `p` and `cur_n`, and `p` is already defined, we need to ensure that `cur_n` is recalculated correctly based on the new `count`.

Since the problem does not specify how `count` changes, we assume it is updated in the loop body. Therefore, the state remains the same, but `cur_n` must be recalculated based on the new `count`.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 3 - 2*count; `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`**.
