The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `k` and `q`. The initial values of `k` and `q` are overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`t`, `p`, `qs`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of k unique integers in ascending order, where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100, `qs` is a list of q integers, where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, `results` is an empty list.**
