Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 3 - 2*count; `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`.**

Explanation:
- `cur_n` was initially `3 - count`.
- `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3 and must be 2 or less.
- After executing `cur_n -= count`, `cur_n` becomes `3 - count - count`, which simplifies to `3 - 2*count`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
