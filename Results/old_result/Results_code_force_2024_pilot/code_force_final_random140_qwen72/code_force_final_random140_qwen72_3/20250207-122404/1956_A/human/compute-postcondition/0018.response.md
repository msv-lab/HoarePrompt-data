Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 249, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the new input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the new input, `results` is a list containing two string elements: the first element is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, and the second element is the same as the first element, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`. `k` and `q` are now updated to the values read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `p`.
- The initial state mentions that `p` was already a list of integers read from a new input, but this line of code updates `p` with a new list of integers.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, `results`, `remaining_players`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
- The values of `k` and `q` are mentioned to be updated to the values read from the input, but since the code snippet provided does not include the actual update of `k` and `q`, they remain as described in the initial state.
