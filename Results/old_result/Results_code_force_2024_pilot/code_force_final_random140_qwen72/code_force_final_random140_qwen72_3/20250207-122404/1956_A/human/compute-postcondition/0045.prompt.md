You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100.
def func_1(p):
    max_n = 100
    remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        cur_n = n
        
        while cur_n >= min(p):
            count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
            cur_n -= count
        
        remaining_players[n] = cur_n
        
    #State: `p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where each element `remaining_players[n]` (for 1 <= n <= 100) is the result of the loop's computation for that `n`, specifically the largest value less than the minimum value in `p` after subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`; `n` is 100; `cur_n` is the largest value less than the minimum value in `p`.
    return remaining_players
    #The program returns a list `remaining_players` of 101 integers, where each element `remaining_players[n]` (for 1 <= n <= 100) represents the largest value less than the minimum value in `p` after subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. The first element of the list is not used (index 0), and the rest of the elements are computed based on the described logic.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `p` of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order (1 <= p[i] <= 100). It returns a list `remaining_players` of 101 integers, where each element `remaining_players[n]` (for 1 <= n <= 100) represents the largest value less than the minimum value in `p` after subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. The first element of the list (index 0) is not used.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `remaining_players` of 101 integers, where each element `remaining_players[n]` (for 1 <= n <= 100) represents the largest value less than the minimum value in `p` after subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. The first element of the list is not used (index 0), and the rest of the elements are computed based on the described logic.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
