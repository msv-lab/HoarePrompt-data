The code appends a string to the `results` list. This string is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`. The `results` list initially contains two string elements, both representing the elements in `res`. After appending, `results` will contain three elements: the two original strings and the newly added string.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 249, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the new input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the new input, `results` is a list containing three string elements: the first two elements are the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, and the third element is also the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.**
