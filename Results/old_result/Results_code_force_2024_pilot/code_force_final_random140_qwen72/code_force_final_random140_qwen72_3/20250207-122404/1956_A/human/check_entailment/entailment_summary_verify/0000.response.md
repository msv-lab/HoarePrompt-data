Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial player counts from 1 to 100.
   - It iterates through each possible initial player count `n` and simulates the rounds of the game until no more players are kicked out.
   - For each `n`, it calculates the number of players remaining after all rounds by repeatedly subtracting the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
   - The result is stored in the `remaining_players` list, which is indexed by the initial player count `n`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values for `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the precomputed results for the sequence `p`.
   - It then looks up the number of remaining players for each initial player count in `qs` using the precomputed results.
   - The results for each test case are collected and returned as a list of strings.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when the initial player count is less than the smallest value in the sequence `p`.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the sequence `p` includes values close to 100, ensuring that the simulation does not go out of bounds.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of precomputation in `func_1` ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases efficiently without recalculating the results for each test case.

5. **Function Summary Verification**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` accurately describes its behavior. It reads input values, processes each test case, and returns the correct results as a list of strings.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the game logic and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
