Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, `results` is an empty list, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `remaining_players` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(p)`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `results` remain unchanged.
- The value of `remaining_players` is now the output of `func_1(p)`, which processes the list `p` and returns a result. The exact value of `remaining_players` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
