Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial numbers of players (from 1 to 100).
   - It iterates through each possible number of players `n` and simulates the rounds of the game until no more players are kicked out.
   - The `bisect.bisect_right` function is used to efficiently find the number of players to kick out in each round.
   - The result is stored in the `remaining_players` list, which will be used later to quickly answer queries.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of queries `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the precomputed results for the sequence `p`.
   - It then uses these precomputed results to answer each query in `qs` and appends the results to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the answers for all test cases.

The program correctly handles the input and output format specified in the problem statement and uses efficient precomputation to handle multiple queries quickly. Therefore, the program is correct.
