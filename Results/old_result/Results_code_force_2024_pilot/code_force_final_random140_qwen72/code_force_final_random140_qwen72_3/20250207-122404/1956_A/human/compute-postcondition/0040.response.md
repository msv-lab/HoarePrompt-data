Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is the largest value less than the minimum value in `p`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in the list `p`.
- In each iteration, `count` is determined by finding the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`.
- `cur_n` is then decremented by `count`.
- This process repeats until `cur_n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `cur_n` will be the largest value that is still less than the smallest element in `p`.
- All other variables (`p`, `max_n`, `remaining_players`, and `n`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
