Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes a list `p` of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - It computes a list `remaining_players` of 101 integers, where each element `remaining_players[n]` (for 1 <= n <= 100) represents the number of players remaining after simulating the game for `n` initial players.
   - The simulation is done by repeatedly removing players at positions specified by `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The function correctly uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the current number of players `cur_n`, and then subtracts this count from `cur_n` to simulate the removal of players.
   - The final state of `remaining_players` is returned, which correctly represents the number of players remaining for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input values for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1(p)` to get the `remaining_players` list.
   - It then constructs a list `res` by selecting the elements from `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.
   - The function appends the space-separated string representation of `res` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the results for all test cases.

Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. The input and output handling is correct, and the logic for simulating the game and determining the number of remaining players is implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
