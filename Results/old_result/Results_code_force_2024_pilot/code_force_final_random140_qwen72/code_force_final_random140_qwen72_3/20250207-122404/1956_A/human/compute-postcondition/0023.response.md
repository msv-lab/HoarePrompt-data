Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the input, `results` is a list containing `t` string elements, each of which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for each iteration, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs` for the last iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 250, indicating the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run.
- For each iteration, `k` and `q` were input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, and `p` and `qs` were lists of integers read from the input.
- The `results` list contains `t` string elements, where each string element is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for each iteration.
- The `remaining_players` variable holds the result of `func_1(p)` from the last iteration.
- The `res` list contains the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs` from the last iteration.
