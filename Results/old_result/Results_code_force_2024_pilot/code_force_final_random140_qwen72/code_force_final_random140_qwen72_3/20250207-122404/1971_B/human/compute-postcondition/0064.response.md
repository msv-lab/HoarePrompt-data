Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1, `i` is `len(string)`, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the `string` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from 0 to `len(string) - 1`.
- The variable `k` will count how many times the first character `m` appears in the `string`.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
