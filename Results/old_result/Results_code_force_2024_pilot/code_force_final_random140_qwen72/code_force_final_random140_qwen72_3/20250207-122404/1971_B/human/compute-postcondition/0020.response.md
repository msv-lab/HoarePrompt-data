Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is the length of `string` - 1.
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in `string`.
- All characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'No'` is hardcoded.

Output: **No**
