Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is the length of the new `string`, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is the number of occurrences of `m` in the new `string`, and the length of the new `string` is 1, meaning all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`.**
