To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

- The loop statement is: `for i in range(cnt_test_cases):`
- The loop will execute if `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and will start from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized by the loop, starting from 0. The other variables (`t` and `s`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 (which is handled by the loop itself).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
