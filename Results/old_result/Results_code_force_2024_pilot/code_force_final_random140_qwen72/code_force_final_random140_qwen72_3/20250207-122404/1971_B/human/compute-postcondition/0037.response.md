Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is 1, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 1, `m` is the first character of the new `string`. If `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 2. If the length of the new `string` is 1, then all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, if the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string` plus 1.***
