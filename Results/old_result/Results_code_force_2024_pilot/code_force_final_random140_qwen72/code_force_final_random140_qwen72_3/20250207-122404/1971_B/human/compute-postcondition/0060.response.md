Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1, `i` is 1, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least two characters, `m` is the first character of the new `string`. If the first character of `string` (at index `i`) is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.***
