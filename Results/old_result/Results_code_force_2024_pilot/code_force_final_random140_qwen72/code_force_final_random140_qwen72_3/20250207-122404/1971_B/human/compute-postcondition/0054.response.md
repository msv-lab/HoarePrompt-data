To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1
- `i` is `len(string) + 1`
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`
- `k` is 0
- If the length of the new `string` is 1, all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`
- If the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(len(string)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `len(string)` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` in the loop head is the loop index, which will iterate from 0 to `len(string) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will not execute if `len(string)` is 0. Therefore, `string` must have at least one character.
- The initial value of `i` should be 0, not `len(string) + 1`, for the loop to start correctly.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (unchanged)
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters (unchanged)
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1 (unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (adjusted from `len(string) + 1`)
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least one character (adjusted)
- `m` is the first character of the new `string` (unchanged)
- `k` is 0 (unchanged)

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1, `i` is 0, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least one character, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is 0**
