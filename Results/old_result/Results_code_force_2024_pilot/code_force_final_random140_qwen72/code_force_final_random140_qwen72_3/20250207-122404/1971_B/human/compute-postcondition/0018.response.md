Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is the length of `string` - 1, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in `string`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range.
- The variable `s` remains a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The variable `cnt_test_cases` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is incremented from 0 to the length of `string` - 1 as the loop iterates over each character in `string`.
- The variable `string` remains the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- The variable `m` remains the first character of `string`.
- The variable `k` is incremented each time the current character `string[i]` matches the first character `m`. After all iterations, `k` will hold the total count of occurrences of `m` in `string`.
