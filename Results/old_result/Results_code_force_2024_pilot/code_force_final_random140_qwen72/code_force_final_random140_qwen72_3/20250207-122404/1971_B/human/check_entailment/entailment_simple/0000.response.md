Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the string and checks if the string length is 1. If so, it prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single-character string to something different.
3. It then initializes `m` with the first character of the string and counts how many times this character appears in the string (`k`).
4. If `k` is equal to the length of the string, it means all characters in the string are the same, and thus, it's impossible to rearrange the string to something different. The function correctly prints "No".
5. However, if `k` is not equal to the length of the string, it means there are at least two different characters in the string, and it's possible to rearrange the string to something different. The function prints "Yes" and then prints the sorted version of the string.

The issue with the current implementation is in the way it generates the rearranged string. Sorting the string does not guarantee that the resulting string will be different from the original string. For example, if the input string is "ab", sorting it will result in "ab", which is the same as the original string. This violates the requirement that the rearranged string must be different from the original string.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the rearranged string is indeed different from the original string. One simple way to do this is to swap the first two characters if they are different, or find the first character that is different from the first character and swap it with the first character.

Given this, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
