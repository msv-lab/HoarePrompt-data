The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Since `k` was initially 1 (if `string[i]` is equal to `m`) or 0 (otherwise), the new value of `k` will be 2 if `string[i]` is equal to `m`, or 1 if `string[i]` is not equal to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least 2 characters, `m` is the first character of `string`, and if `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 1.**
