Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1.
- `i` is `len(string)`.
- `string` is the input string `s` stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(sorted(string)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String Stripping**: The variable `string` is the input string `s` stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. This means any spaces at the beginning or end of `s` are removed.
2. **Sorting the String**: The `sorted(string)` function sorts the characters in the `string` in ascending order (alphabetically).
3. **Joining the Sorted Characters**: The `''.join(sorted(string))` function joins the sorted characters back into a single string.

### Example:
- If `s = " bca "`:
  - After stripping, `string = "bca"`.
  - Sorting the characters: `sorted("bca")` results in `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
  - Joining the sorted characters: `''.join(['a', 'b', 'c'])` results in `"abc"`.

### General Case:
- The `string` is a sequence of lowercase English letters without leading or trailing spaces.
- The `sorted(string)` will always produce a list of characters in alphabetical order.
- The `''.join(sorted(string))` will produce a string where the characters are in alphabetical order.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the characters of the `string` in alphabetical order.

Output: **the characters of the `string` in alphabetical order**.
