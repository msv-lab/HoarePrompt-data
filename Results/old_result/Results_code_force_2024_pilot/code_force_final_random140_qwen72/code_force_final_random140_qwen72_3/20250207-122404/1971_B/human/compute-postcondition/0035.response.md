The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the object `string`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `string` and the value of `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `string`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace with a length greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `string` must still have a length greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is 1, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 1, `m` is the first character of the new `string`. If `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. If the length of the new `string` is 1, then all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, if the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.**
