Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1, `i` is 1, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least two characters, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is 1 if the first character of `string` (at index `i`) is equal to `m`, otherwise `k` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is incremented by 1.
- If the first character of `string` (at index `i`) is equal to `m`, then `k` was initially 1, and now it becomes 2.
- If the first character of `string` (at index `i`) is not equal to `m`, then `k` was initially 0, and now it becomes 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`, `i`, `string`, `m`) remain unchanged.
