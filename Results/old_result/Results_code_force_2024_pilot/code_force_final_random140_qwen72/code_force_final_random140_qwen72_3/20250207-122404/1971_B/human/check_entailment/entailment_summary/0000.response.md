Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of rearranging the characters of a given string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the program’s logic and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Single Character Check**: If the string length is 1, the program correctly outputs 'No' because it is impossible to rearrange a single-character string to form a different string.
3. **Unique Character Check**: The program checks if all characters in the string are the same by counting the occurrences of the first character. If all characters are the same, it outputs 'No' because no rearrangement can produce a different string.
4. **Rearrangement**: If the string contains more than one unique character, the program outputs 'Yes' and then prints the sorted version of the string. Sorting the string ensures that the characters are rearranged, but it does not guarantee that the new string will be different from the original string.

However, the program has a logical flaw in the rearrangement part. Sorting the string might result in the same string if the original string was already sorted. For example, if the input string is "abc", sorting it will still result in "abc", which is the same as the original string. This violates the requirement that the new string must be different from the original string.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the rearranged string is different from the original string. One simple way to do this is to swap the first two characters if they are different, or swap the first character with any other character that is different.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce a different string when one is possible.

Correctness: **False**
