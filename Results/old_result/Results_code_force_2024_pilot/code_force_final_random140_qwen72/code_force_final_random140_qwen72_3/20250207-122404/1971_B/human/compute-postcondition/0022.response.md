The provided `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes various conditions and variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`, `i`, `string`, `m`, `k`), but none of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
