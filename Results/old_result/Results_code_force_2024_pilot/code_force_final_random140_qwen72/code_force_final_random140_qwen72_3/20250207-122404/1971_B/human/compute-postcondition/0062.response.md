The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character of `string` (at index `i`) was equal to `m`. Since `i` is 2, and `m` is the first character of the new `string`, if the third character of `string` is equal to the first character, `k` would have been 1, and now it becomes 2. If the third character is not equal to the first character, `k` would have been 0, and now it becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least two characters, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is 1 if the third character of `string` is not equal to the first character, otherwise `k` is 2.**
