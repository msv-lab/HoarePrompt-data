You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        m = string[0]
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        
        m = string[0]
        
        k = 0
        
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` is the total number of test cases processed, `i` is the final value of the loop counter which is equal to `cnt_test_cases`, `string` is the last input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of the last `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the last `string`. If `k` equals the length of the last `string`, all characters in the last `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of the last `string`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `cnt_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string`.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string is 1, the function prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
   - This is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Checking for All Characters Being the Same:**
   - The function initializes `m` with the first character of the string and `k` with 0.
   - It then iterates through the string and counts how many times the first character appears (`k`).
   - If `k` equals the length of the string, it means all characters are the same, and the function prints 'No'.
   - This is also correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Generating a Different String:**
   - If the string has more than one distinct character, the function prints 'Yes'.
   - It then sorts the string and prints the sorted version.
   - Sorting the string ensures that the characters are rearranged, but it does not guarantee that the resulting string is different from the original string. For example, if the input string is "ab", sorting it will still result in "ab", which is the same as the original string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where the string length is 1 or all characters are the same.
   - However, it fails to ensure that the generated string is different from the original string in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not always generate a string that is different from the original string. Specifically, sorting the string does not guarantee a different string when the original string is already sorted or has a specific order that remains unchanged after sorting.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
