Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`.
- `i` is the length of the new `string`.
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of occurrences of `m` in the new `string`.
- The length of the new `string` is 1, meaning all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
