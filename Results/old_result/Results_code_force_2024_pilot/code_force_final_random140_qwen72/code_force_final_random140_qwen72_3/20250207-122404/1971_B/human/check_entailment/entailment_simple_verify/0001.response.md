### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `cnt_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string`.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string is 1, the function prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
   - This is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Checking for All Characters Being the Same:**
   - The function initializes `m` with the first character of the string and `k` with 0.
   - It then iterates through the string and counts how many times the first character appears (`k`).
   - If `k` equals the length of the string, it means all characters are the same, and the function prints 'No'.
   - This is also correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Generating a Different String:**
   - If the string has more than one distinct character, the function prints 'Yes'.
   - It then sorts the string and prints the sorted version.
   - **Issue:** Sorting the string does not guarantee that the resulting string is different from the original string. For example, if the input string is "ab", sorting it will still result in "ab", which is the same as the original string. Similarly, if the input string is "abc", sorting it will result in "abc", which is the same as the original string if it was already sorted.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where the string length is 1 or all characters are the same.
   - However, it fails to ensure that the generated string is different from the original string in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not always generate a string that is different from the original string. Specifically, sorting the string does not guarantee a different string when the original string is already sorted or has a specific order that remains unchanged after sorting.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
