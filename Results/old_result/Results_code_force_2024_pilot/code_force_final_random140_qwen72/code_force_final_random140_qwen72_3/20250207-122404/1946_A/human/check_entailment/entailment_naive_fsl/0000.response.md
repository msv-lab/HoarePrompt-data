Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The issue lies in how the program calculates the result. Specifically, the line `res = a[p:].count(a[p])` counts the occurrences of the current median in the part of the array from the median position to the end. However, this does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `3`

In this case, the current median is `3`. To increase the median, we need to increase the value at the median position (index 2) to at least `4`. This can be done in one operation by incrementing the value at index 2. However, the program incorrectly counts the number of occurrences of `3` in the subarray `[3, 4, 5]`, which is `1`, and then adds the count of `3` in the entire subarray, resulting in `3`.

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
