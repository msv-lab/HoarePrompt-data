Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.
- `t` must be greater than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `p`**:
   - `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - This formula essentially finds the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even. For example:
     - If `n = 5`, then `p = (5 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 2`.
     - If `n = 6`, then `p = (6 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 2`.

2. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list, the sublist `a[p:]` starts from the element at index `p` and includes all elements from that point onwards.
   - The element at index `p` is the median of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or one of the two middle elements if `n` is even.

3. **Calculating `res`**:
   - To find `res`, we count how many times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.
   - Since `a` is sorted, all occurrences of the element at index `p` will be contiguous in the sublist `a[p:]`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 6`.
  - `p = (6 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 2`.
  - The element at index `p` is `a[2] = 3`.
  - The sublist `a[p:]` is `[3, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - The number of times `3` appears in `[3, 3, 4, 5]` is 2.
  - Therefore, `res = 2`.

### General Case:
- For any sorted list `a` and any valid `n`, the value of `res` will be the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of `res`, which is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of times the element at index p appears in the sublist a[p:])**
