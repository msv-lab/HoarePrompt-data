Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 2, `operations` is `median - a[i]` if `a[i]` is less than `median`; otherwise, `operations` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `operations` is updated by adding the result of `median - a[i]` to its current value.
- If `a[i]` is less than `median`, `operations` becomes `median - a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` is not less than `median`, `operations` remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`, `i`) retain their initial values.
