Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`, `t` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an input integer.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and is still a sorted list of integers.
- The value of `p` remains unchanged and is still `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- The value of `res` is updated to the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
