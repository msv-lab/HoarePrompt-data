Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`, `t` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than 1 still holds true.
- The list `a` now contains the same elements but in a sorted order.
