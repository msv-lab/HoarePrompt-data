To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case are `_` and `t`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. This variable does not need to be adjusted as it is just a counter.
2. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and is crucial for determining how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since `t` is already defined to be within the range 1 to 10^4, it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute (i.e., `t` is greater than 0).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given state.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
