The code snippet sets `operations` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `operations`, which was the sum of `median - a[j]` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is 0.**
