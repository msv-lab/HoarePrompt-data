Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is less than the median value, `operations` is incremented by `(median - a[2])`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.***
