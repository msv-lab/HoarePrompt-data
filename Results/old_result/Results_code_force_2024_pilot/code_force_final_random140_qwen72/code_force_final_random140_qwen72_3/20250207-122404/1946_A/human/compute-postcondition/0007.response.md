The code snippet `res = a[p:].count(a[p])` calculates the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist of `a` starting from index `p` to the end of the list.

- `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, which means `p` is the middle index of the list `a` (or just before the middle if `n` is even).
- `a[p:]` creates a sublist from the element at index `p` to the end of the list `a`.
- `a[p]` is the element at index `p` in the list `a`.
- `a[p:].count(a[p])` counts how many times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.

After executing the code:
- `res` is assigned the count of the element at index `p` in the sublist `a[p:]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.**
