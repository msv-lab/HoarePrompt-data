The value of `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This means `p` is the floor division of `n + 1` by 2, then subtracted by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.**
