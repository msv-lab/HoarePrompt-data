Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is less than `median`, `operations` is set to `median - a[i]`. Otherwise, `operations` remains 0.***
