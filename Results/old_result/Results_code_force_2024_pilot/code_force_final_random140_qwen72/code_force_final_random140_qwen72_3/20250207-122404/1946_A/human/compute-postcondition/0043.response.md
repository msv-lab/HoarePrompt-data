Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `median_index` is updated to `n // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `median`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
