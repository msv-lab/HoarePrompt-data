Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`, `t` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to the count of the element at index `p` in the sublist `a[p:]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `p`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
