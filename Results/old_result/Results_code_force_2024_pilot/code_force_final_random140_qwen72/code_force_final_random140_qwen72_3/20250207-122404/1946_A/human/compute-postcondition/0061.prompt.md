Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    median = a[median_index]
    operations = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < median:
            operations += median - a[i]
    print(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the element at index `median_index` of `a`, `i` is `n-1`. `operations` is the sum of `median - a[j]` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[j]` is less than the median value, `operations` is incremented by `(median - a[j])`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]` where `a[j] < median`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
