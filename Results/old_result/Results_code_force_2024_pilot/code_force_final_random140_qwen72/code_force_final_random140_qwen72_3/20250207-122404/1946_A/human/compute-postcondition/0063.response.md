Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a`, calculates the median value, and computes the number of operations required to make all elements in `a` at least as large as the median. The function prints the number of operations for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
