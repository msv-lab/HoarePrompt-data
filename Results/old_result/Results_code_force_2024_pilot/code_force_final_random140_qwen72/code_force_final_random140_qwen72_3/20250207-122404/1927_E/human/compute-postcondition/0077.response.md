To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
```

The loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of the `permutation` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)` for the next iteration.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 2.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k`.
- `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 2` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)` if `idx % 2 != 0`.
- `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments) - 2` if `idx % 2 != 0`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.
- `len(permutation)` is `n`, which is fixed.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is calculated as `2 + 2*k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `n`.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k`, we need to check if `2 + 2*k < n`.

Given that `k` is an even number and `2 <= k <= n`, the condition `2 + 2*k < n` should hold true for the next iteration as long as `k` is within the given range.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed to the current state because the condition `2 + 2*k < n` is already satisfied given the constraints on `k` and `n`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). `idx` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 2` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)` if `idx % 2 != 0`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments) - 2` if `idx % 2 != 0`.**
