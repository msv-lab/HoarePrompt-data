Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem statement. `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case, which reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction**: In `func_1`, the permutation is constructed by alternating between filling positions with increasing values from 1 and decreasing values from `n`. This approach ensures that the permutation is valid (contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once).

3. **k-Level Permutation Requirement**: The key requirement is that the permutation should be k-level, meaning the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` should differ by no more than 1. The construction method in `func_1` achieves this by distributing the smallest and largest values evenly across the permutation. Specifically, it fills positions in a pattern that ensures the sums of the segments of length `k` are balanced.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, when `k` is 2, the permutation will alternate between the smallest and largest remaining values, ensuring that the sums of adjacent pairs differ by at most 1.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is correct. Each permutation is printed as a space-separated string of integers, as required.

Given the above points, the program meets the problem requirements and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
