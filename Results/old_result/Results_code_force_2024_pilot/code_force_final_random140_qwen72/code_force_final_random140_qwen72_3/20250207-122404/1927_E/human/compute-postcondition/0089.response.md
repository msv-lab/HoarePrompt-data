The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The output description is missing, but typically, such a function might perform some operation based on these parameters and return a result.

Since the specific output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of functions with such constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are integers, and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 with `k` being even. The function returns a result based on these parameters, though the specific output is not detailed.**
