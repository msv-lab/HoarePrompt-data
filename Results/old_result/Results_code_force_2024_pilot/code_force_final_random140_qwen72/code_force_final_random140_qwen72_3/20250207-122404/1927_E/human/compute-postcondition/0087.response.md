Output State: **`n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The `permutation` list is fully populated with values according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, elements at indices that are multiples of `k` starting from 0 are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (for even indices) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (for odd indices). The variable `bottom_v` will be `n // 2 + 1 + (total number of even-indexed assignments)`, and `top_v` will be `n - (n // 2) - (total number of odd-indexed assignments)`. The variable `idx` is now `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to the next multiple of `k` beyond the last index of `permutation`. The `result` is a string containing the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.**
