Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n` and prints this permutation as a space-separated string. The permutation is constructed such that for each index `i` that is a multiple of `k`, the value at that index is filled alternately with increasing values from 1 (for even `i`) and decreasing values from `n` (for odd `i`). After the function completes, the original values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the permutation is printed to the console. **
