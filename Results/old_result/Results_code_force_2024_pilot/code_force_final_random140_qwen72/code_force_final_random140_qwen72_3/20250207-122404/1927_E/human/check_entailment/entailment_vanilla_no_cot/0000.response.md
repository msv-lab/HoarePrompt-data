Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly addresses the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This is done in `func_2()`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the values of `n` and `k` for the current test case.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two pointers, `bottom_v` starting at 1 and `top_v` starting at `n`, to fill the permutation.
   - It iterates over the indices from 0 to `k-1` and fills the permutation in a pattern that ensures the k-level condition is met.
   - For even indices, it fills the permutation with increasing values starting from 1.
   - For odd indices, it fills the permutation with decreasing values starting from `n`.

3. **Output**: The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

4. **K-Level Condition**: The construction method ensures that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by at most 1. This is achieved by alternating between increasing and decreasing sequences, which helps balance the sums across different segments.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
