To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop condition:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is 1.
- If `idx` is even, the element at index `k` is set to 2, `bottom_v` is 3, `top_v` is `n`.
- If `idx` is odd, the element at index `k` is set to `n - 1`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n - 1`.
- In both cases, `idx` remains 0 and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.
- `len(permutation)` is `n` because `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

Given that `2 * k` is already a value, we need to ensure that `2 * k < n` for the loop to execute again. Since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, this condition should generally hold true unless `k` is very close to `n/2`.

### Final State:
Since the condition `2 * k < n` is already satisfied by the given constraints (2 <= k <= n), no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is 1. If `idx` is even, the element at index `k` is set to 2, `bottom_v` is 3, `top_v` is `n`. If `idx` is odd, the element at index `k` is set to `n - 1`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n - 1`. In both cases, `idx` remains 0 and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.**
