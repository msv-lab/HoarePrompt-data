Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), `idx` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v`, `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 1`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `bottom_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`, the element at index `2 + k` in the `permutation` list is now set to `bottom_v`.
- The value of `bottom_v` is determined based on the conditions given in the initial state, which includes the number of even-indexed assignments and the formula `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 1`.
- The value of `permutation[2]` remains `bottom_v` as specified in the initial state.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
