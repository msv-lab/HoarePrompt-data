To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`: This is the variable being compared.
   - `len(permutation)`: This is the length of the `permutation` list.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n` (since `permutation` is a list of length `n`).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.
   - Given the initial state, this translates to `2 < n`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2.
   - Since `n` is already constrained to be an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even, `n` must be at least 3 to satisfy the condition `2 < n`.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. Since `n` is already constrained to be at least 2, and `k` is even, the minimum value for `n` that satisfies all conditions is 3.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)`, `idx` is 2, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2, with `n` being greater than 2**.
