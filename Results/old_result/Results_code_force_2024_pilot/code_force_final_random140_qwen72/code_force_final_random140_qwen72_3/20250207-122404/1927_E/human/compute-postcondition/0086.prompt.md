Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while idx < k:
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
    while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
        if idx % 2 == 0:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
            bottom_v += 1
        else:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
            top_v -= 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
    idx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1` if `idx` is even and `n // 2 + 2` if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` if `idx` is even and `n - (n // 2) - 1` if `idx` is odd, `idx` is 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is the smallest multiple of `k` greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). The loop will have filled the `permutation` list up to the last valid index that is a multiple of `k` plus `idx` (which is now 2). `bottom_v` will be the next value to be assigned if the loop were to continue, which is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)`. `top_v` will be the next value to be assigned if the loop were to continue, which is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)`. `idx` is now 2, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is the last valid index processed by the loop plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The `permutation` list is fully populated with values according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, elements at indices that are multiples of `k` starting from 0 are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (for even indices) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (for odd indices). The variable `bottom_v` will be `n // 2 + 1 + (total number of even-indexed assignments)`, and `top_v` will be `n - (n // 2) - (total number of odd-indexed assignments)`. The variable `idx` is now 3, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to the next multiple of `k` beyond the last index of `permutation`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
