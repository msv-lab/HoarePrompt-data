Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of generating a k-level permutation for given values of n and k, where k is even and within the specified range. The solution involves two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Ensures that `func_1` is called exactly `t` times, which matches the problem's requirement for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - Constructs a permutation of length `n` that satisfies the k-level condition.
   - The permutation is built by alternating between filling positions with increasing values from 1 and decreasing values from `n`, ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The constructed permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

The key points to verify for correctness are:
- The permutation is of length `n`.
- The permutation contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- The sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

Given the implementation:
- The permutation is correctly constructed by alternating between increasing and decreasing values.
- The sums of continuous segments of length `k` are managed to ensure they differ by no more than 1.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
