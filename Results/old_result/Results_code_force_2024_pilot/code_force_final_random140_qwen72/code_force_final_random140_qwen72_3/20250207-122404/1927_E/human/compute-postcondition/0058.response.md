Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). The loop will have filled the `permutation` list up to the last valid index that is a multiple of `k` plus `idx` (which is now 2). `bottom_v` will be the next value to be assigned if the loop were to continue, which is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)`. `top_v` will be the next value to be assigned if the loop were to continue, which is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)`. `idx` is now 2, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is the last valid index processed by the loop plus 1.**
