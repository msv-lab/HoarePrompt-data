To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is \(2 \times k + 1\).

3. **Loop Condition Evaluation:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given `len(permutation) = n`, the loop will continue if \(2 \times k + 1 < n\).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be adjusted.
   - The current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is \(2 \times k + 1\).
   - For the loop to execute again, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` should be incremented to the next multiple of `k` plus `idx`.

5. **Next Multiple of `k` Plus `idx`:**
   - The next multiple of `k` plus `idx` would be \(3 \times k + 1\).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to \(3 \times k + 1\).

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). If `idx` is even, the value at index `1` in `permutation` is `n // 2 + 1`, and the value at index `k + 1` in `permutation` is `n // 2 + 2`. If `idx` is odd, the value at index `1` in `permutation` is `n - (n // 2) - 2`, and the value at index `k + 1` in `permutation` is `n - (n // 2) - 2`. `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 3` if `idx` is even and `n // 2 + 2` if `idx` is odd, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` if `idx` is even and `n - (n // 2) - 3` if `idx` is odd. `idx` is 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `3 * k + 1`.**
