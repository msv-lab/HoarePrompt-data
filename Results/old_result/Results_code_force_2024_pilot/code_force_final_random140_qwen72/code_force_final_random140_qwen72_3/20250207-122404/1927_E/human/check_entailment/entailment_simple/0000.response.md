Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input. This aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two pointers, `bottom_v` starting from 1 and `top_v` starting from `n`, to fill the permutation list.
   - The loop iterates over indices from 0 to `k-1`, and for each index, it fills the permutation list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index.
   - For even indices, it assigns values from `bottom_v` and increments `bottom_v`.
   - For odd indices, it assigns values from `top_v` and decrements `top_v`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation, the program converts the list to a space-separated string and prints it.
   - This matches the required output format.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that `k` is even and within the specified range.
   - The permutation is constructed such that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, which satisfies the problem's requirement for a `k-level` permutation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2` and `k = 2`), and it correctly constructs the permutation.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
