To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is either `1` if `idx` is even or `n` if `idx` is odd.
- `bottom_v` is 2 if `idx` is even and 1 if `idx` is odd.
- `top_v` is `n` if `idx` is even and `n - 1` if `idx` is odd.
- `idx` is 0.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.
- `len(permutation)` is `n` because `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

### Current Values:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.
- `len(permutation)` is `n`.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute again if `k < n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `k` is already given to be less than or equal to `n`, and `k` is even, the current state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute one more time.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is either `1` if `idx` is even or `n` if `idx` is odd, `bottom_v` is 2 if `idx` is even and 1 if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is `n` if `idx` is even and `n - 1` if `idx` is odd, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.**
