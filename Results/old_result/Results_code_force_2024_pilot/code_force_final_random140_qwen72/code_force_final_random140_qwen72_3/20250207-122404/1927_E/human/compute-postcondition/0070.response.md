To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n`.

3. **Loop Condition Evaluation:**
   - The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < n`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`, we need to ensure that `2 + k < n`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even.
   - Given `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, `2 + k` will always be less than `n` as long as `k` is at least 2 and `n` is at least 4 (since `2 + 2 = 4`).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `2 + k` is already less than `n` given the constraints, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), if `idx % 2 == 0`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 1`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)`, and `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v`, if `idx % 2 != 0`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments) - 1`, and `permutation[2]` is `top_v`, `idx` is 2, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`.**
