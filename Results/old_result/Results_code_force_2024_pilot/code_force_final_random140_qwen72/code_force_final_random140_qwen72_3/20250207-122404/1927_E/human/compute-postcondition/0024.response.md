Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is 1 and the element at index `2 * k` which is 3, `bottom_v` is 3, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.**

Explanation:
- The code sets the element at index `2 * k` in the `permutation` list to the value of `bottom_v`, which is 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
