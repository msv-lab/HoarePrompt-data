Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is now `0` (where `t` was originally greater than 0), and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Each time the loop runs, `func_1()` is called, and `t` is decremented by 1. When `t` reaches 0, the condition `t > 0` becomes false, and the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times, where `t` is the original value of `t`.
