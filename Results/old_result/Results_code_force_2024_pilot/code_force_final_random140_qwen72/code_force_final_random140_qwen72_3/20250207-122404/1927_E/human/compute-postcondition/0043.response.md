To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k + 1`.

### Analysis:
- The length of `permutation` is `n`.
- The current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is currently `k + 1`, we need to ensure that `k + 1 < n`.

### Conclusion:
Since `k` is an even number and `2 <= k <= n`, the condition `k + 1 < n` should hold true as long as `k` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the current state to allow the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). If `idx` is even, the value at index `1` in `permutation` is `n // 2 + 1`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 2`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)`. If `idx` is odd, the value at index `1` in `permutation` is `n - (n // 2) - 2`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1` if `idx` is even and `n // 2 + 2` if `idx` is odd, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - 2`. `idx` is 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k + 1`.**
