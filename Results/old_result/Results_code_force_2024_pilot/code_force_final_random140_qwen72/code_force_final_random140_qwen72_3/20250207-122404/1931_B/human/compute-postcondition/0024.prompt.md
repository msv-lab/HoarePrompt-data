Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of containers. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2·10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, there exists at least one pair of indices `i` and `i + 1` such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met, but the values of `t`, `n`, `_`, and `arr` remain as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1 (so it is now `_ + 1`), `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` (so `t > _ + 1`), and `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. The elements in `arr` are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order, regardless of whether the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)))` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
