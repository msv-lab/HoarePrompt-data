You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of containers. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2·10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        arr.sort()
        
        if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` has been incremented by the number of test cases executed (i.e., `_` is now equal to `t`), and for each test case, `n` was an input integer, and `arr` was a sorted list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if all elements in `arr` were in non-decreasing order, the program printed 'YES'; otherwise, it printed 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `arr` for each test case remain as described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of containers `n` and a list `a` of initial water amounts in the containers. It returns the result of processing each test case, which involves computations related to the distribution of water in the containers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
