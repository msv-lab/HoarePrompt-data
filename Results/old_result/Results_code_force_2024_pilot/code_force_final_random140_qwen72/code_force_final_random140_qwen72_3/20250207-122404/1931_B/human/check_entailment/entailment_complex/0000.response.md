Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that sorting the array and checking if it is in non-decreasing order will determine whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. However, this approach does not consider the actual redistribution of water according to the rules specified in the problem (i.e., pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index).

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the average amount of water per container (which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers) can be achieved by redistributing the water according to the given rules. Since the sum of the water amounts is divisible by the number of containers, the average amount of water per container is an integer. We need to ensure that we can move water from containers with more than the average to those with less than the average, adhering to the rule that water can only be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the correct solution involves checking if the maximum amount of water in any container is greater than the average plus the minimum amount of water in any container. If this condition is met, it is impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount of water.

However, the provided program simply sorts the array and checks if it is in non-decreasing order, which is not the correct approach. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
