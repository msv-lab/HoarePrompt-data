Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1 (so it is now `_ + 1`), `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` (so `t > _ + 1`), and `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. The elements in `arr` are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order, regardless of whether the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)))` is true or false.***
