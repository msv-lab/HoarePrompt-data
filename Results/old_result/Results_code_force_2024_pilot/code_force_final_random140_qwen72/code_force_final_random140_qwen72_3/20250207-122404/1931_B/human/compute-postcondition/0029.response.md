Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, `possible` remains True. Otherwise, `possible` is set to False.***
