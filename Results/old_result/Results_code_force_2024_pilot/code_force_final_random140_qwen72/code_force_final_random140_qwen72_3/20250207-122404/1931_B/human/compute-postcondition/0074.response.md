Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2 * target`, `i` is 1, `possible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The value of `possible` is set to `False`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `current_balance`, and `i`) retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
