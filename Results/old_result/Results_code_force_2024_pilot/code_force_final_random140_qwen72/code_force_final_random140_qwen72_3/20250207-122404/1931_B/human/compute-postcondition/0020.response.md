Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1 (so it is now `_ + 1`), `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` (so `t > _ + 1`), `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. The elements in `arr` are now guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.**
