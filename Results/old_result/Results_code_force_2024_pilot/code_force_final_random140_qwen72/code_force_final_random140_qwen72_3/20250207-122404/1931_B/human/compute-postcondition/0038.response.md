Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `i` is 0, `possible` is True**

Explanation: The code updates the `current_balance` by adding the difference between the first element of the list `a` and the `target`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `current_balance` is specifically `a[0] - target`.
