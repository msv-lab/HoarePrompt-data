Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic of sorting the array and checking if it is in non-decreasing order does not address the core requirement of the problem, which is to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers using the specified pouring operation. The program fails to account for the specific operation constraints (pouring from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one) and the goal of making all containers have the same amount of water. The example provided in the original assessment correctly demonstrates that the program's output can be incorrect for valid inputs where equalization is possible. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
