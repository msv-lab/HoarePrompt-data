The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop will run `t` times. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it dictates how many times the loop will iterate.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `_` has just completed one of these iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented, but since `_` is a throwaway variable, its actual value is not tracked. Instead, what matters is that `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue running.

Since `t` is the controlling factor for the number of iterations, and it does not change within the loop head, the state of `t` remains the same. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, `possible` remains True. Otherwise, `possible` is set to False.**
