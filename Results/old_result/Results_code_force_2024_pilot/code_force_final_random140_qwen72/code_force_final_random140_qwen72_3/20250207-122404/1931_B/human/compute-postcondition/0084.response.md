Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `target` is `total_water // n`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `possible` is True, indicating that `current_balance` has not been less than 0 at any point during the loop.

Given that `possible` is True, it means that the condition where `current_balance` is less than 0 has not been met at any point during the loop. This implies that the program has successfully completed its checks and the condition for printing "YES" is satisfied.

Therefore, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string "YES".

Output: **YES**
