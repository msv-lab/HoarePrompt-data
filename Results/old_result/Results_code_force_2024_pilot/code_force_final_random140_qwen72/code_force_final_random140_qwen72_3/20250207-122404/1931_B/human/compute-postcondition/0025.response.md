The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of containers, and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` in each test case does not exceed 2·10^9, and the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns the results of processing each test case, likely involving some computation or transformation related to the distribution of water in the containers.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of containers `n` and a list `a` of initial water amounts in the containers.
