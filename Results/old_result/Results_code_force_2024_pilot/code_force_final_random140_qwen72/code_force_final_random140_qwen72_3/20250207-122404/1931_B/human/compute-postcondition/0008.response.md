Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- There exists at least one pair of indices `i` and `i + 1` such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.

Given these conditions, the statement `print('NO')` will always print the string `'NO'`.

Explanation:
- The condition that there exists at least one pair of indices `i` and `i + 1` such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]` implies that the list `arr` is not strictly sorted in ascending order. This is a contradiction to the initial state that `arr` is a sorted list in ascending order.
- Since the condition is contradictory, the code will always execute the `print('NO')` statement.

Output: **NO**
