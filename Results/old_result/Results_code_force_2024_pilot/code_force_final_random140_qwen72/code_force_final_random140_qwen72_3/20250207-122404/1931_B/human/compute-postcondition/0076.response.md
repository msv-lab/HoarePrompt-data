Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2 * target`, `i` is 1. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.***
