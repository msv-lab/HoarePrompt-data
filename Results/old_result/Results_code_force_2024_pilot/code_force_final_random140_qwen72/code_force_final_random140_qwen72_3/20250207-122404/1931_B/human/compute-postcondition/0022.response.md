Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `_` is incremented by 1, so it is now `_ + 1`.
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` (so `t > _ + 1`).
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. The elements in `arr` are now guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
