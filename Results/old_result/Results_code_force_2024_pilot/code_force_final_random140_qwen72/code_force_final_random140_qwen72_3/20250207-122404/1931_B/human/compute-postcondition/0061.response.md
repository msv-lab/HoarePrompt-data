Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` is True. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `a`.
- The initial state already specifies that `a` is a list of integers input by the user, so the value of `a` is updated to the new list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `total_water`, `target`, `current_balance`, `i`, and `possible`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.
