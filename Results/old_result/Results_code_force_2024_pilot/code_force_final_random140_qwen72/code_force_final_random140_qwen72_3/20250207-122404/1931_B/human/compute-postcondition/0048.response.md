The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2 * target`, `i` is 2, `possible` remains True**
