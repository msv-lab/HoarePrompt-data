Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` remains True. Otherwise, `possible` is set to False.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the outer loop, the variable `t` (which initially represented the number of test cases) will be decremented to 0 because the loop runs exactly `t` times.
- **`n` is an input integer greater than 0**: This variable represents the number of containers in the last test case processed.
- **`a` is a list of integers input by the user**: This list contains the initial amounts of water in the containers for the last test case processed.
- **`total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`**: This is the total amount of water in the containers for the last test case.
- **`target` is `total_water // n`**: This is the target amount of water each container should have after balancing.
- **`current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`**: This variable tracks the cumulative balance of water as the inner loop iterates through the containers. It is the sum of the differences between the actual water in each container and the target amount.
- **`i` is `n-1`**: This is the index of the last container processed in the inner loop.
- **If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` remains True. Otherwise, `possible` is set to False**: This condition determines whether it is possible to balance the water in the containers without any container having a negative balance at any point during the process. If `possible` is True, the output for that test case will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'.
