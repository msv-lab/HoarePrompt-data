Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` is True. Otherwise, `possible` is False.***
