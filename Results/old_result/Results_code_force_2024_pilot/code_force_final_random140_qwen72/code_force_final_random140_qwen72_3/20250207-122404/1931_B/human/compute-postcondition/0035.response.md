Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` remains True if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, otherwise `possible` is set to False.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `current_balance` to 0, which overrides its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `i`, and `possible`) remain unchanged. The new value of `current_balance` is explicitly stated as 0.
