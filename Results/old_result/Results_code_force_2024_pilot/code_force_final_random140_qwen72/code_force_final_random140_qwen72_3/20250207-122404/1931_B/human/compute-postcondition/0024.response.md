Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` has been incremented by the number of test cases executed (i.e., `_` is now equal to `t`), and for each test case, `n` was an input integer, and `arr` was a sorted list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if all elements in `arr` were in non-decreasing order, the program printed 'YES'; otherwise, it printed 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `arr` for each test case remain as described in the initial state.**
