You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of containers. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2·10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` has been incremented by the number of test cases executed (i.e., `_` is now equal to `t`), and for each test case, `n` was an input integer, and `arr` was a sorted list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if all elements in `arr` were in non-decreasing order, the program printed 'YES'; otherwise, it printed 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `arr` for each test case remain as described in the initial state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container has a lower index than the destination container. The total amount of water across all containers is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring an even distribution is theoretically possible.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of containers (`n`) and the initial amounts of water in each container (`arr`).

3. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `arr`. Sorting is a critical step here because it allows us to check if the smallest values can be increased to match the largest values through the allowed operations.

4. **Checking Monotonicity**: The program checks if the sorted array is monotonically increasing using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)))`. This condition is always true for a sorted array, so it doesn't actually help in solving the problem.

5. **Logical Flaw**: The key issue is that the program incorrectly assumes that if the array is sorted, it means the water can be evenly distributed. However, the problem requires checking if the water can be redistributed such that all containers have the same amount of water, which is not guaranteed by simply sorting the array.

6. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the minimum value in the array can be increased to the average value (which is the target amount of water in each container after redistribution). If the minimum value is already greater than or equal to the average, then it is impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers equal.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not properly check if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Correctness: **False**
