Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `target` is `total_water // n`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `possible` is False.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
