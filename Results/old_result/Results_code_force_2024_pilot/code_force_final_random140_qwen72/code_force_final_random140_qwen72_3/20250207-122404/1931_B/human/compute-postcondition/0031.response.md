The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged, but `n` now holds a specific integer value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, `possible` remains True. Otherwise, `possible` is set to False.**
