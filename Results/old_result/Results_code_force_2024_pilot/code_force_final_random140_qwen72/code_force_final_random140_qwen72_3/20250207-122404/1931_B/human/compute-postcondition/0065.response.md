Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is set to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `current_balance`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
