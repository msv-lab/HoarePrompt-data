Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` now holds an integer value provided by the user. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` still holds. The list `arr` remains sorted in ascending order.
