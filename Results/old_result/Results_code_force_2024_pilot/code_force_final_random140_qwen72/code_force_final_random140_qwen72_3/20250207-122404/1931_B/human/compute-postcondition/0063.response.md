Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` is True. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `target = total_water // n` updates the value of `target`.
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `target` is now set to the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `current_balance`, `i`, and `possible`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `possible` remains the same: if `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` is True; otherwise, `possible` is False.
