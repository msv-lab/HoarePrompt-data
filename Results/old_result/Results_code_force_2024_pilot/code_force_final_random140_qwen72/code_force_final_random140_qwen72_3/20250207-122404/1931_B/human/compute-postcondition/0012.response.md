The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`.

- The initial state includes `t` being an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` being an input integer, `arr` being a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `_` being incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
- After executing the code, `arr` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, and `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
