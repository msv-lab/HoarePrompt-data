The code snippet `total_water = sum(a)` recalculates the value of `total_water` as the sum of the elements in the list `a`. Since the initial state already defines `total_water` as the sum of the elements in `a`, this operation does not change the value of `total_water`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the explicit confirmation that `total_water` is indeed the sum of the elements in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` is True. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**
