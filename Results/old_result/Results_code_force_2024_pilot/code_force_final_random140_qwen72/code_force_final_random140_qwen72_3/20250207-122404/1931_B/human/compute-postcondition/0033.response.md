Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` remains True if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, otherwise `possible` is set to False.**

Explanation:
- The code `total_water = sum(a)` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `total_water`.
- The initial state already mentions that `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, so this value is updated accordingly.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `target`, `current_balance`, `i`, `possible`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
