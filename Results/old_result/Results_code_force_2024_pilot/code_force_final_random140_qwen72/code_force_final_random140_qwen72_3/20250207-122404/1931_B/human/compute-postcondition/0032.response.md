The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `target` is `total_water // n`
- `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `possible` remains True if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, otherwise `possible` is set to False

The code snippet:
```python
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

Impact of the code:
- The variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `total_water`, `target`, `current_balance`, `i`, `possible`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` remains True if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, otherwise `possible` is set to False.**
