Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` remains True if `current_balance` was never less than 0 during the loop, otherwise `possible` is set to False.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `target = total_water // n` updates the value of `target`.
- `target` is now the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `current_balance`, `i`, `possible`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `target` is used in the calculation of `current_balance`, which is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The conditions for `possible` remain the same as described in the initial state.
