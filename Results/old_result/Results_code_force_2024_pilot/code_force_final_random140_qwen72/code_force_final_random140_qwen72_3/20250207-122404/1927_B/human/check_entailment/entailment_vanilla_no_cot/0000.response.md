Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly reconstruct the string from the trace. The issue lies in how the characters are being selected from the string `sam`. The modulo operation `% 27` is used, but since `sam` has 26 characters (from 'a' to 'z'), the correct operation should be `% 26`.

Additionally, the logic for selecting the character and updating the map needs to be adjusted to ensure that the correct character is chosen based on the count of occurrences.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    a_map = {}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] not in a_map:
            a_map[a[i]] = 0
        res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 26]
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
    return res
```

This version ensures that the character selection is within the bounds of the alphabet and correctly tracks the occurrences of each character.
