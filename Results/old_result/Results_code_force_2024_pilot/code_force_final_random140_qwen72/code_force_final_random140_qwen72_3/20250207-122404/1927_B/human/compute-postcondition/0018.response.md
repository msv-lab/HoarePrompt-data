Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`. It returns a string `res` constructed by mapping each integer in `a` to a character in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'. The character selected for each integer in `a` is determined by the current count of occurrences of that integer in `a` modulo 27. This means that the first occurrence of an integer maps to the first character in the string, the second occurrence maps to the second character, and so on, wrapping around to the beginning of the string after the 27th character. The final state of the program includes the returned string `res` and the updated counts of each integer in the dictionary `a_map`. **
