Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`, `res` is the string containing the characters at indices `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in `sam` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `beg` is the value of `a_map[a[n-1]]` before the last increment.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the number of iterations.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is used to control the loop and the updates to `a_map`.
- The string `sam` remains unchanged as it is used to map indices to characters.
- The dictionary `a_map` is updated such that each key (an integer from 0 to n-1) maps to the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.
- The string `res` is constructed by appending the character at the index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in `sam` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `i` is `n-1` after the loop completes, indicating the last iteration.
- The variable `beg` holds the value of `a_map[a[n-1]]` before the last increment, which is the count of the last element in `a` before the final update.
