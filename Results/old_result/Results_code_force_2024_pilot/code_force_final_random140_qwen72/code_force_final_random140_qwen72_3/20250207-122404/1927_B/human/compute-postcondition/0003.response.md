To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n)
- `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
- `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0
- `res` is an empty string

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `i` should start at 0.

Since `n` is already given as a positive integer, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `res` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
