Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `res` is the string containing the character at index `a_map[a[0]] % 27` in `sam`, `i` is 0, `beg` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` appends the character at the index `a_map[a[0]] % 27` in the string `sam` to the string `res`.
- Since `a_map` maps each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `a_map[a[0]]` is 0.
- Therefore, `a_map[a[0]] % 27` is 0 % 27, which is 0.
- The character at index 0 in `sam` is 'a'.
- Thus, `res` becomes 'a'.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `sam`, `a_map`, `i`, `beg`) remain unchanged.
