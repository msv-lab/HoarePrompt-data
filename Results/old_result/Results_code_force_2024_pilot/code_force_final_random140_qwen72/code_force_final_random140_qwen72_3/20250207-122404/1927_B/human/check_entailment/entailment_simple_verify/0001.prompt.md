You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`, `res` is the string containing the characters at indices `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in `sam` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `beg` is the value of `a_map[a[n-1]]` before the last increment.
    return res
    #The program returns the string `res` which is constructed by taking the character at index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in the string `sam` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Here, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', and `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Trace Array**:
   - The trace array `a` represents the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the original string `s`.
   - For example, if `a[i] = 2`, it means that the character at position `i` in `s` has appeared twice before in the string.

2. **Reconstructing the String**:
   - To reconstruct the string `s`, we need to keep track of how many times each character has appeared so far.
   - We can use a dictionary `a_map` to store the count of each value in the trace array `a`.

3. **Character Selection**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a fixed string `sam` containing all lowercase Latin letters.
   - For each position `i` in the trace array `a`, we determine the character to add to the result string `res` based on the current count of `a[i]` in `a_map`.
   - The character is selected from `sam` using the modulo operation to ensure it cycles through the available characters.

4. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Initialize an empty result string `res`.
   - Initialize a dictionary `a_map` to keep track of the counts of each value in `a`.
   - Iterate through each element in `a`:
     - Determine the starting index `beg` for the character selection using `a_map[a[i]]`.
     - Append the character from `sam` at position `beg % 27` to `res`.
     - Increment the count of `a[i]` in `a_map`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with all zeros in the trace array correctly.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the character selection wraps around the alphabet if necessary.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, where `n` is the length of the string.
   - The space complexity is O(n) for storing the trace array and the result string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` from the given trace array `a` and meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
