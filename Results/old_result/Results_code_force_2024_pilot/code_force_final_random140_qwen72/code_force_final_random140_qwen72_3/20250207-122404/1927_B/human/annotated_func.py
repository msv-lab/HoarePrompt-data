#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string.

    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`, `res` is the string containing the characters at indices `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in `sam` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `beg` is the value of `a_map[a[n-1]]` before the last increment.
    return res
    #The program returns the string `res` which is constructed by taking the character at index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in the string `sam` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Here, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', and `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`. It returns a string `res` constructed by mapping each integer in `a` to a character in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'. The character selected for each integer in `a` is determined by the current count of occurrences of that integer in `a` modulo 27. This means that the first occurrence of an integer maps to the first character in the string, the second occurrence maps to the second character, and so on, wrapping around to the beginning of the string after the 27th character. The final state of the program includes the returned string `res` and the updated counts of each integer in the dictionary `a_map`.
