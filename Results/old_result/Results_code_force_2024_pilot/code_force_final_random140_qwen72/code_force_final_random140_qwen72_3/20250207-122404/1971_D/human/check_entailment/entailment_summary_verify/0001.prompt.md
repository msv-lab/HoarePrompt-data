You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        print(cut + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` and calculates the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string, then prints this count plus one. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes `t` being 0 (indicating all test cases have been processed), and the last processed binary string `a` remains in memory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
1. The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
3. It initializes a variable `cut` to 0, which will count the number of cuts needed.
4. It iterates through the string `a` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
5. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is '1' and the next character is '0'. If this condition is met, it increments the `cut` counter by 1.
6. After the loop, it prints `cut + 1`, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed.

The logic behind the program is that every time a '1' is followed by a '0', a cut is necessary to ensure that the '1's and '0's can be rearranged correctly. Adding 1 to the `cut` value accounts for the fact that the number of pieces is always one more than the number of cuts.

This approach correctly handles all the given examples:
- For "11010", there are two places where '1' is followed by '0', so the number of cuts is 2, and the number of pieces is 3.
- For "00000000", no cuts are needed, so the number of pieces is 1.
- For "1", no cuts are needed, so the number of pieces is 1.
- For "10", one cut is needed, so the number of pieces is 2.
- For "0001111", no cuts are needed, so the number of pieces is 1.
- For "0110", one cut is needed, so the number of pieces is 2.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
