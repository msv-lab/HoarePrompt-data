You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        print(cut + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is within the range 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        
        print(cut + 1)
        
    #State: `s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500, `t` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `_` is a placeholder, `a` is the last input string with length greater than 0, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and `cut` is the number of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each binary string, it counts the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0'. This count represents the number of cuts needed to separate the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Adding 1 to this count gives the total number of pieces required. This approach works because each transition from '1' to '0' indicates a point where a new piece must start to ensure that all '0's come before all '1's in the final sorted string. The program handles all edge cases, including strings that are already sorted, strings with no transitions, and strings of various lengths. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
