Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic of the program is to count the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the binary string. Each such occurrence indicates a necessary cut to ensure that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Adding 1 to the total count of cuts gives the minimum number of pieces required, which is the correct approach to solving this problem. The program handles all the cases mentioned in the example and adheres to the constraints specified in the problem description.
