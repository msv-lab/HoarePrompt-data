Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key insight is that the minimum number of cuts needed is determined by the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in the binary string. Each transition indicates a point where a new piece must start to ensure that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. Adding 1 to the count of these transitions gives the total number of pieces required.

The program processes each test case by reading a binary string, counting the transitions from '1' to '0', and printing the result. This matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement and the example provided.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the expected results for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
