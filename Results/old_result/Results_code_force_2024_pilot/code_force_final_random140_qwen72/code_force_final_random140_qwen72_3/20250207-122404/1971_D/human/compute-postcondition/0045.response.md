Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `a` is an input string with length greater than 0.
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `cut` is the number of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cut + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `cut`**: This variable counts the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`.
2. **Expression `cut + 1`**: The code snippet adds 1 to the value of `cut` and prints the result.

### Explanation:
- The value of `cut` is determined by the number of occurrences of the pattern '10' in the string `a`.
- The expression `cut + 1` will add 1 to this count and print the result.

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of `cut` plus 1, where `cut` is the number of occurrences of the pattern '10' in the string `a`.

Output: **cut + 1 (where cut is the number of occurrences of the pattern '10' in the string `a`)**
