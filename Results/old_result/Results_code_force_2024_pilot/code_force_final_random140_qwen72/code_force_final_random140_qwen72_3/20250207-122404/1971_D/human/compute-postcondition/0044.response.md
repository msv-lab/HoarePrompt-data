Output State: **`s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an input string with length greater than 0, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and `cut` is the number of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the current character `a[i]` is '1' and the next character `a[i + 1]` is '0'.
- If both conditions are met, the variable `cut` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `cut` will contain the total count of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`.
- The other variables (`s`, `t`, `_`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
