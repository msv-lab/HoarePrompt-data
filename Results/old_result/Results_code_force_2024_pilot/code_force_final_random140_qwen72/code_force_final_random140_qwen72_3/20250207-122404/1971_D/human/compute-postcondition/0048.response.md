Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` and calculates the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string, then prints this count plus one. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes `t` being 0 (indicating all test cases have been processed), and the last processed binary string `a` remains in memory. **
