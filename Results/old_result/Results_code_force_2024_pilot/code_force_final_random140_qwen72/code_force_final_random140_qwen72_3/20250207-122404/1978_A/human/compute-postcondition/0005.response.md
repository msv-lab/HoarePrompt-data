The code snippet `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())` sorts the list `ls`, removes and returns the last element of the sorted list, and assigns the integer value of this element to the variable `other`.

- `ls` is a list of strings, and sorting it will arrange the elements alphabetically.
- `.pop()` removes the last element from the sorted list, which is the largest string in lexicographical order.
- This string is then converted to an integer and assigned to `other`.

Since `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, and `other` is now the integer value of the largest string in the sorted `ls`, `other` will be equal to `last` if `last` was the largest element in `ls`. If `last` was not the largest element, `other` will be the integer value of the largest element in `ls`.

The initial state variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `ls` remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `other`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.**
