The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one element removed, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`**
