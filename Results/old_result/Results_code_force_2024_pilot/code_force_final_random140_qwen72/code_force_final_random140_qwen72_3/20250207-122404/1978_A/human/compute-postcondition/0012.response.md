Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one element removed.
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`.
   - `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(last + other)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`.
   - `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one element removed, `last` is the integer value of the element that was removed.
   - `other` is the largest element in the sorted version of `ls`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the sum of `last` and `other`.

Given the initial state, the exact numerical values of `last` and `other` depend on the specific input and the element removed from `ls`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of these two values.

Output: **last + other (where last is the integer value of the last element removed from ls and other is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted ls)**
