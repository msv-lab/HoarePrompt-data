The code snippet `ls = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This operation updates the value of `ls`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from the previous `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted previous `ls`.**
