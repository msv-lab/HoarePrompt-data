Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the new input but with the last element removed.
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from the previous `ls`.
   - `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the current sorted `ls`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(last + other)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from the list `ls`.
   - `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the current sorted `ls`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will add the value of `last` and the value of `other` and print the result.

Since the exact values of `last` and `other` depend on the specific input and the state of the list `ls`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **last + other (where `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from the list `ls` and `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the current sorted `ls`)**
