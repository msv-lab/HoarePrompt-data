Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), representing the number of test cases. n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    ls = input().split()
    last = int(ls.pop())
    other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
    print(last + other)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one element removed, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the new input but with the last element removed, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from the previous `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the current sorted `ls`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
