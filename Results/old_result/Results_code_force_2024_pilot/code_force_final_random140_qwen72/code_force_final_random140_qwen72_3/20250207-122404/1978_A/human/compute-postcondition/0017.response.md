The code snippet `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())` sorts the list `ls`, removes the last element from the sorted list, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `other`.

- `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the new input but with the last element removed.
- `other` was previously defined as the integer value of the largest element in the sorted previous `ls`.
- After executing the code, `other` will now hold the integer value of the largest element in the current `ls`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ls`, `last`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the new input but with the last element removed, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from the previous `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the current sorted `ls`.**
