### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `ls`.

2. **Logic for Maximum Pages**:
   - The function pops the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, storing it in `last`.
   - It then sorts the remaining elements in `ls` and pops the last element (which is the largest), converting it to an integer and storing it in `other`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of `last` and `other`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the pages of the two books Alice reads, one from each pile.
   - The current logic assumes that the last book in the list and the largest book in the remaining list should be used. However, this is not always correct.
   - To maximize the sum, Alice should read the two books with the highest number of pages, regardless of their positions in the list.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Instead of popping the last element and sorting the remaining elements, the function should sort the entire list and take the two largest elements.
   - This ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are selected.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `[2, 1 1]`, the function correctly outputs `2` because the two books have the same number of pages.
   - For the input `[4, 2 3 3 1]`, the function should output `6` (3 + 3), but it outputs `4` (3 + 1), which is incorrect.
   - For the input `[5, 2 2 3 2 2]`, the function should output `5` (3 + 2), but it outputs `5` (3 + 2), which is correct by coincidence.
   - For the input `[2, 10 3]`, the function correctly outputs `13` (10 + 3).
   - For the input `[3, 1 2 3]`, the function should output `5` (3 + 2), but it outputs `5` (3 + 2), which is correct by coincidence.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation is incorrect because it does not always select the two books with the highest number of pages. The correct approach would be to sort the entire list and take the two largest elements.

### Correctness:
**False**
