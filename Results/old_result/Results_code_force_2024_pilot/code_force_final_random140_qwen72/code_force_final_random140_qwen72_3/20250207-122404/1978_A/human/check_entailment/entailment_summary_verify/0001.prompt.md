You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1

    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = input().split()
        last = int(ls.pop())
        other = int(sorted(ls).pop())
        print(last + other)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of books and their page counts, then calculates and prints the sum of the last page count and the second-largest page count from the input list. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `ls`.

2. **Logic for Maximum Pages**:
   - The function pops the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, storing it in `last`.
   - It then sorts the remaining elements in `ls` and pops the last element (which is the largest), converting it to an integer and storing it in `other`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of `last` and `other`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the pages of the two books Alice reads, one from each pile.
   - The current logic assumes that the last book in the list and the largest book in the remaining list should be used. However, this is not always correct.
   - To maximize the sum, Alice should read the two books with the highest number of pages, regardless of their positions in the list.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Instead of popping the last element and sorting the remaining elements, the function should sort the entire list and take the two largest elements.
   - This ensures that the two books with the highest number of pages are selected.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `[2, 1 1]`, the function correctly outputs `2` because the two books have the same number of pages.
   - For the input `[4, 2 3 3 1]`, the function should output `6` (3 + 3), but it outputs `4` (3 + 1), which is incorrect.
   - For the input `[5, 2 2 3 2 2]`, the function should output `5` (3 + 2), but it outputs `5` (3 + 2), which is correct by coincidence.
   - For the input `[2, 10 3]`, the function correctly outputs `13` (10 + 3).
   - For the input `[3, 1 2 3]`, the function should output `5` (3 + 2), but it outputs `5` (3 + 2), which is correct by coincidence.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation is incorrect because it does not always select the two books with the highest number of pages. The correct approach would be to sort the entire list and take the two largest elements.

### Correctness:
**False**
