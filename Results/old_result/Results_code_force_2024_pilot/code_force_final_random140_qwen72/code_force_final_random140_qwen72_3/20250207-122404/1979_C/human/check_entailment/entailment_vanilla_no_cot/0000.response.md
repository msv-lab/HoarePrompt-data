Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct according to the problem statement:

1. **Calculation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all elements in `k`. This approach is incorrect because the goal is to find a set of bets such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. Multiplying all multipliers together and then dividing by each multiplier to get the bets does not necessarily satisfy this condition.

2. **Use of HCF (GCD)**: The program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the calculated bets and then divides each bet by this HCF. While this step is intended to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values, it does not guarantee that the sum of the bets will be less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if sum(c) >= m:` is incorrect. The sum of the bets should be compared against the individual returns (i.e., `k[i] * c[i]` for each `i`), not against the product of all multipliers `m`.

A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. One possible method is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to ensure that the bets are proportional to the multipliers and then adjust the bets to meet the required condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_bets(k):
    l = reduce(lcm, k)
    bets = [l // ki for ki in k]
    total_bet = sum(bets)
    if total_bet >= l:
        return -1
    return bets

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = find_bets(k)
    if result == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version uses the LCM of the multipliers to find a set of bets that satisfies the condition. It checks if the total bet is less than the LCM and outputs the bets accordingly.
