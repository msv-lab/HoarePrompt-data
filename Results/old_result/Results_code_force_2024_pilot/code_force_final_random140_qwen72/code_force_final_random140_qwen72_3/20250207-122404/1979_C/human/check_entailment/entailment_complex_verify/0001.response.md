### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount we would receive back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, we get back `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values (`m`), which is used to find a common multiple.
   - It then calculates the value `m / k_i` for each `k_i` and stores it in the list `c`. This ensures that the sum of `c` is a multiple of the LCM of `k_i`.
   - The program finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the function `func_1`.
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the GCD to reduce the values while maintaining the same ratio.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced values in `c` is strictly less than the product `m`. If it is, it prints the values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the product of all `k_i` values. This is used to find a common multiple.
   - **Step 2:** For each `k_i`, calculate the value `m / k_i` and store it in the list `c`. This ensures that the sum of `c` is a multiple of the LCM of `k_i`.
   - **Step 3:** Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the function `func_1`.
   - **Step 4:** Divide each element in `c` by the GCD to reduce the values while maintaining the same ratio.
   - **Step 5:** Check if the sum of the reduced values in `c` is strictly less than the product `m`. If it is, print the values; otherwise, print `-1`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses the product of all `k_i` values to find a common multiple, which might be unnecessarily large and could lead to overflow issues for large `k_i` values.
   - The GCD calculation is correct, but the approach to ensure the sum of bets is strictly less than the product `m` might not always work as intended, especially for edge cases.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the GCD and reduces the values in `c` to ensure they are minimal.
   - However, the condition `sum(c) < m` might not always hold true, especially when the multipliers `k_i` are small and the product `m` is large.
   - The program fails to handle cases where the product `m` is very large, leading to potential overflow or incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is generally sound, but it might fail in edge cases where the product `m` is very large, leading to potential overflow or incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is not guaranteed for all inputs.

Final: **False**
