Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min(k_i \cdot x_i)
   \]
   for all \( i \).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \( k_i \) and uses it to determine the bets.
   - It then computes the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of the calculated bets to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratio.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than the product of the multipliers. If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints -1.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \( m \) of all \( k_i \) is used to ensure that the bets are large enough to cover all outcomes.
   - **HCF Calculation**: The HCF is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the required condition.
   - **Sum Check**: The sum of the reduced bets is checked against the product \( m \) to ensure the condition is met.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \( m \) can become very large, potentially leading to overflow issues. However, since the maximum value of \( k_i \) is 20 and \( n \leq 50 \), the product \( m \) should not exceed the limits of typical integer types.
   - **HCF Calculation**: The HCF calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the required condition.
   - **Sum Check**: The sum check is necessary to ensure that the bets meet the problem's requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the bets or determine that no solution exists.
   - The use of the HCF ensures that the bets are minimized while still meeting the condition.
   - The sum check ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.
