The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. The loop iterates over the elements of `numbers` starting from the second element. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how the loop progresses.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
- `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first, second, and third elements of `numbers`.
- `numbers` is a list with at least three elements.
- `num` is the third element of `numbers`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `numbers` must be considered. Since the loop starts from the second element, after the third element (which was `num`), the next element will be the fourth element of `numbers`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `num` will be the fourth element of `numbers`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first, second, and third elements of `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least three elements, `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`.**
