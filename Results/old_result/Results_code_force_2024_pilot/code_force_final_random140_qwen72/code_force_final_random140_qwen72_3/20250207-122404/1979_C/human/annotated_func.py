#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes. k_1, k_2, ..., k_n are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the last element of `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. After the function concludes, the input list `numbers` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the GCD of the elements in `numbers`.
