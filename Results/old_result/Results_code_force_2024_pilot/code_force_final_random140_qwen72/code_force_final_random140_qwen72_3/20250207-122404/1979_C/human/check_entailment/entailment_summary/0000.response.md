Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by finding a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome. The approach taken by the program involves calculating a product \( m \) of all multipliers \( k_i \), and then distributing the bets as \( c_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \). This ensures that the payout for any winning outcome \( k_i \cdot c_i = m \) is the same across all outcomes. However, the sum of the bets \( \sum c_i \) should be less than \( m \) for the solution to be valid.

The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the calculated bets \( c \) to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same relative proportions. This is done to ensure that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition \( \sum c_i < m \).

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The product \( m \) is calculated as the product of all \( k_i \), which is an extremely large number, especially when \( n \) is large. This leads to very large values for \( c_i \), and the sum of these values is likely to be much larger than \( m \), making it impossible to satisfy the condition \( \sum c_i < m \).

A more efficient approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the \( k_i \) values instead of their product. The LCM would provide a smaller \( m \) that still ensures the condition \( k_i \cdot c_i = m \) for any winning outcome. Additionally, the program should check if the sum of the bets \( \sum c_i \) is less than \( m \) before dividing by the GCD to avoid unnecessary reductions that might still result in a sum greater than or equal to \( m \).

Given the current implementation, the program is likely to fail in many cases because the sum of the bets \( \sum c_i \) will often be greater than or equal to \( m \), leading to the output of `-1` even when a valid solution exists.

Correctness: **False**
