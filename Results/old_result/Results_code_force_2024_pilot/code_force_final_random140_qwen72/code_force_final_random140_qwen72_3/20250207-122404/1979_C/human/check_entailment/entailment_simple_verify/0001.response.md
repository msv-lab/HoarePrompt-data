### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount we would receive back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, we get back `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values, denoted as `m`.
   - It then calculates the value `m / k_i` for each `k_i` and stores it in the list `c`.
   - The program finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the function `func_1`.
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the GCD to reduce the values while maintaining the same ratio.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced values in `c` is strictly less than `m`. If it is, the distribution is valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the product of all `k_i` values. This is used to find a common multiple.
   - **Step 2:** For each `k_i`, calculate the value `m / k_i` and store it in the list `c`. This ensures that the sum of `c` is a multiple of the LCM of `k_i`.
   - **Step 3:** Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the function `func_1`.
   - **Step 4:** Divide each element in `c` by the GCD to reduce the values while maintaining the same ratio.
   - **Step 5:** Check if the sum of the reduced values in `c` is strictly less than the product `m`. If it is, print the values; otherwise, print `-1`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values, which can be very large and may lead to overflow issues for large `k_i` values. However, since the constraints are relatively small (`2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20`), this is unlikely to cause overflow.
   - **GCD Calculation:** The GCD calculation is correct and ensures that the values in `c` are minimized while maintaining the same ratio.
   - **Sum Check:** The condition `sum(c) < m` is used to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the product `m`. This condition is necessary to meet the problem's requirement.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the GCD and reduces the values in `c` to ensure they are minimal.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m` is a valid check to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program handles the constraints well and should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is sound and meets the requirements of the problem. The potential issue of overflow is mitigated by the small constraints on `k_i`. Therefore, the program is correct for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**
