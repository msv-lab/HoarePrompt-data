Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 2, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop plus `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2, and `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- All other variables (`k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `s` is the original `s` plus the integer division of `s` by `(k - 1)` plus 1.
