The code snippet assigns values to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` using the `map` function, which converts the input values to integers. The input is expected to be three space-separated integers. The values of these variables are now specific integers provided by the user.

The initial state specifies that `_` is not explicitly defined but will be iterated over a range determined by `int(input())`, which must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000. This part of the state remains unchanged because the code snippet does not affect `_`.

Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned specific integer values from user input, and `_` is not explicitly defined but will be iterated over a range determined by a positive integer between 1 and 1000.**
