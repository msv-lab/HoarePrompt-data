Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `s` does not accurately reflect the conditions required to ensure that Sasha can always reach any number of coins `n`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

- **Input:** `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
- **Expected Output:** `NO`
- **Actual Output:** `YES`

**Explanation:**
- According to the problem, if Sasha starts with 1 coin and can only lose once in a row, he cannot guarantee that he will have any number of coins `n` after placing bets. If he loses the first bet, he will have 0 coins and cannot place any more bets.
- However, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` for this case.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the initial number of coins `a` is too small to guarantee reaching any number of coins `n` given the constraints on consecutive losses `x` and the multiplier `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
