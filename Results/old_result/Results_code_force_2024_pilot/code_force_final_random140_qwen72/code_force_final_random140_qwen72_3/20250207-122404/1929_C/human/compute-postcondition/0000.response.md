The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer, which aligns with the constraints given for `t`.

State: **`_` is not explicitly defined but will be iterated over a range determined by `int(input())`, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 1000)**.
