The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned specific integer values from user input, `s` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
