You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their initial values from the input. The variable `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the inner loop for each test case, and `i` is `x - 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. It then calculates a value `s` based on `k` and `x` through a series of iterations. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function completes, `t` is effectively 0 (as all test cases have been processed), and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case are no longer relevant.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
   - He can place a bet of `y` coins, where `y` is a positive integer and `y <= a`.
   - If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - If he loses, his coins decrease by `y`.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To ensure that Sasha can always win, he needs a strategy that allows him to recover from losses and still make progress towards his goal.
   - The key is to understand how much he can lose in a row and still have enough coins to continue betting.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will lose a total of `y + 2y + 3y + ... + xy` coins.
   - This sum can be calculated as `y * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x) = y * (x * (x + 1) / 2)`.
   - After losing `x` times, he must have enough coins left to place another bet and potentially win back his losses.

4. **Mathematical Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses as `s`.
   - For each loss, the next bet should be large enough to cover the previous losses and still make progress.
   - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery after `x` losses.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 1.
   - It then iterates `x` times, each time increasing `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - Finally, it checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery after `x` consecutive losses.
   - The logic of the program aligns with the mathematical reasoning and the problem requirements.
