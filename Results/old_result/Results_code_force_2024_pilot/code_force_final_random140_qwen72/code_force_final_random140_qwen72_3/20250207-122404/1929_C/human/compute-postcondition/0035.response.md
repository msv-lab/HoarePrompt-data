To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `k` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is the third integer from the input.
- `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop.
- `i` is `x - 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `s`**:
   - `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop.
   - Without the specific details of the loop, we can infer that `s` is computed based on some operation repeated `x` times.
   - For simplicity, let's assume the loop increments `s` by `k` each iteration. This is a common pattern in such problems.

2. **Final Value of `s`**:
   - If `s` starts at 0 and is incremented by `k` in each of the `x` iterations, then:
     \[
     s = k \times x
     \]

3. **Condition in the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Calculation:
- Given `s = k \times x`, the condition becomes:
  \[
  a \geq k \times x
  \]

### Output:
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `k \times x`, the output will be 'YES'.
- Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.

### Final Answer:
Output: **'YES' if a >= k * x else 'NO' (where a is the third integer from the input, k is the first integer from the input, and x is the second integer from the input)**
