The value of `s` is updated by adding the result of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Initially, `s` is 3. The value of `k` is the first integer from the input, and since `x` is the second integer and must be greater than 2, `k` can be any integer. The value of `a` is the third integer from the input, and `i` is 2.

Let's calculate the new value of `s`:
- `s` is initially 3.
- `s // (k - 1)` depends on the value of `k`. Since `k` is an integer, `k - 1` is also an integer.
- `s // (k - 1)` performs integer division of 3 by `k - 1`.
- Adding 1 to the result of the integer division and then adding this to the current value of `s`.

Therefore, the new value of `s` is `3 + (3 // (k - 1)) + 1`.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 2, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is 3 + (3 // (k - 1)) + 1, `i` is 2**
