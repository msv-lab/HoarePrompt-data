The code snippet `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` modifies the value of `s`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Initial Value of `s`:**
   - `s` is initially calculated as `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - Since `1 // (k - 1)` is an integer division, it will be 0 if `k > 1` (which is true because `x` is greater than 1, implying `k` is also greater than 1).
   - Therefore, `s` is initially `1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.

2. **Update of `s`:**
   - The new value of `s` is `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - Substituting the initial value of `s` (which is 2), we get:
     - `s // (k - 1)` is `2 // (k - 1)`.
     - If `k > 2`, then `2 // (k - 1)` is 0.
     - Therefore, `s += 0 + 1` which means `s` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.

Since `k` is the first integer from the input and `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 1, the value of `k` is greater than 1. This ensures that the integer division `2 // (k - 1)` is 0.

Therefore, the updated value of `s` is 3.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is 3, `i` is 1.**
