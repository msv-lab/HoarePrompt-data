The code snippet updates the value of `s` by adding the result of the floor division of `s` by `(k - 1)` plus 1. Let's break down the changes:

- `s` is updated to `s + (s // (k - 1)) + 1`.
- The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is now `s + (s // (k - 1)) + 1`, and `i` is 0.**
