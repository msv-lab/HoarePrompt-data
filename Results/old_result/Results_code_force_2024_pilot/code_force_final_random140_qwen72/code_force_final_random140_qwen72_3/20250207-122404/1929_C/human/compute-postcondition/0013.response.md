The provided code snippet assigns new values to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into three parts, each converted to an integer using the `map` function.

Given the initial state:
- `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their initial values.
- `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop.
- `i` is `x-1`.

After executing the code:
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are now assigned the values from the input.
- The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop, and `i` is `x-1`.**
