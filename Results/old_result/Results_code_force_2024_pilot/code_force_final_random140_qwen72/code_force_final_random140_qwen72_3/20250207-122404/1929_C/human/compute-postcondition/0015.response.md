Initial State:
- `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their initial values.
- `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop.
- `i` is `x-1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet reads input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Impact of the Code:
- `k` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `x` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop, and `i` is `x-1`.**
