### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins given the constraints of the casino's rules. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Coins (`a`)**: This is the starting number of coins Sasha has.
2. **Win Multiplier (`k`)**: When Sasha wins, his bet is multiplied by `k`.
3. **Consecutive Losses Limit (`x`)**: Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

The program calculates a threshold value `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can always reach any desired number of coins. The calculation of `s` is done using a loop that simulates the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins once. The formula used in the loop is:

```python
s += s // (k - 1) + 1
```

This formula is derived from the idea that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha should still have enough coins to make a bet that, when won, will bring him back to a state where he can continue making bets. The loop runs `x` times to account for the maximum number of consecutive losses.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
  - Since `a = 7` is greater than or equal to `s = 3`, the output is "YES".

- **Test Case 2**: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
  - Since `a = 1` is less than `s = 3`, the output is "NO".

- **Test Case 3**: `k = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = 15`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
  - After 2 iterations: `s = 3 + 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7`
  - After 3 iterations: `s = 7 + 7 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 15`
  - Since `a = 15` is equal to `s = 15`, the output is "YES".

- **Test Case 4**: `k = 3`, `x = 3`, `a = 6`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 2`
  - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 3`
  - After 3 iterations: `s = 3 + 3 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 5`
  - Since `a = 6` is greater than `s = 5`, the output is "NO".

- **Test Case 5**: `k = 4`, `x = 4`, `a = 5`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 2`
  - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 3`
  - After 3 iterations: `s = 3 + 3 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 4`
  - After 4 iterations: `s = 4 + 4 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 6`
  - Since `a = 5` is less than `s = 6`, the output is "NO".

- **Test Case 6**: `k = 5`, `x = 4`, `a = 7`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (5 - 1) + 1 = 2`
  - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 // (5 - 1) + 1 = 3`
  - After 3 iterations: `s = 3 + 3 // (5 - 1) + 1 = 4`
  - After 4 iterations: `s = 4 + 4 // (5 - 1) + 1 = 5`
  - Since `a = 7` is greater than `s = 5`, the output is "YES".

- **Test Case 7**: `k = 4`, `x = 88`, `a = 1000000000`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 88 iterations, `s` becomes a very large number.
  - Since `a = 1000000000` is less than the final `s`, the output is "NO".

- **Test Case 8**: `k = 25`, `x = 69`, `a = 231`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 69 iterations, `s` becomes a very large number.
  - Since `a = 231` is less than the final `s`, the output is "NO".

- **Test Case 9**: `k = 13`, `x = 97`, `a = 18806`
  - `s` starts at 1.
  - After 97 iterations, `s` becomes a very large number.
  - Since `a = 18806` is less than the final `s`, the output is "NO".
