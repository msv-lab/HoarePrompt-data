Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The logic in the provided program is flawed. Specifically, the way `s` is calculated does not correctly simulate the process of betting according to the rules described in the problem. The program attempts to calculate a threshold `s` that Sasha needs to exceed to ensure he can win any number of coins, but the calculation is incorrect.

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `s`:**
   - The program calculates `s` by repeatedly adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s` for `x` iterations. This does not accurately represent the process of betting and winning/losing.
   - The correct approach should consider the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins, ensuring that he can still recover and continue betting.

2. **Worst-Case Scenario:**
   - In the worst-case scenario, Sasha can lose up to `x` times in a row. After `x` losses, he must win at least once to recover and continue betting.
   - The correct approach should ensure that after `x` losses, Sasha still has enough coins to place a bet that will allow him to recover and continue.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins, we need to check if he can recover from the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses.
   - The minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from `x` losses is `a >= (k - 1) * x + 1`. This ensures that even after `x` losses, he still has at least one coin left to place a bet that will allow him to recover.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery
        min_coins_needed = (k - 1) * x + 1
        print('YES' if a >= min_coins_needed else 'NO')
```

This corrected version checks if Sasha has enough initial coins to ensure he can recover from the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses, which is the correct approach to solving the problem.
