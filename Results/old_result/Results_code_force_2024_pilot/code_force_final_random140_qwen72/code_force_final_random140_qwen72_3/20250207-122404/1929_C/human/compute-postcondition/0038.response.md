Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. It then calculates a value `s` based on `k` and `x` through a series of iterations. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function completes, `t` is effectively 0 (as all test cases have been processed), and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case are no longer relevant. **
