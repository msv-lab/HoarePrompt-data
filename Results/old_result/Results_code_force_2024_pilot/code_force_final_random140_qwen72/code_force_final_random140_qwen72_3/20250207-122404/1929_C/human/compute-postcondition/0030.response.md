The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `x` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1**
