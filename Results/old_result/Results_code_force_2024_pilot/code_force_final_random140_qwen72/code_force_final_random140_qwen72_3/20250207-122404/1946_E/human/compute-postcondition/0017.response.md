To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 1. Given the state right before the loop:

- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N.
- Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]).
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

The key variable here is `i`, which is set to `L[-1] - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`.

Given that `L` is strictly increasing and `L[0]` is 1, the smallest possible value for `L[-1]` is 2 (if `L` has only two elements). However, since `M1` is greater than 1, `L` must have at least two elements, and thus `L[-1]` must be at least 2.

To ensure the loop executes, we need `L[-1] - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `L[-1] > 2`.

Since `L` is strictly increasing and `L[0]` is 1, the smallest possible value for `L[-1]` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `L[-1]` must be at least 3.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `L[-1]` is at least 3. This means `i` must be at least 2.

State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `M1` is greater than 1. `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and `L[-1]` must be at least 3.**
