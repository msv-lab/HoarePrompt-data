The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the context, it seems to operate with the parameters `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R`, where `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers of length M2, where 1 ≤ R[i] ≤ N and R is strictly increasing.

The function returns different values based on specific conditions:
- Case_1: The program returns 0.
- Case_2: The program returns 0.
- Case_3: The program returns 0.
- Case_4: The program returns `ans`, which is the final result after all iterations. If `M2 > 1`, `ans` is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the multiplications performed in the loop, modulo `MOD`. If `M2 ≤ 1`, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.

Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R`, where `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers within specified bounds, and `L` and `R` are strictly increasing lists of integers. The function returns 0 in three cases (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3). In the fourth case (Case_4), if `M2 > 1`, it returns the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the results of multiplications performed in a loop, modulo `MOD`. If `M2 ≤ 1`, it returns the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.**
