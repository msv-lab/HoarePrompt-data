To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1(b, a)` and its impact on the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot know the exact values that `c` and `d` will take. However, we can infer that `c` and `d` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`.

After executing the code:
```
c, d = func_1(b, a)
```

The output state is:
- `a` and `b` remain integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`.
- `c` and `d` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`, but their specific values depend on the implementation of `func_1`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`; `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.**
