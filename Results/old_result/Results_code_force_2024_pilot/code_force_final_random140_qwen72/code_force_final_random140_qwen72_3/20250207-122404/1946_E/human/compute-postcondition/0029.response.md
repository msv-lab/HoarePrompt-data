Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 4` and `nums_left` remains `L[-1] - 4`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`, `cur` remains `M1 - 3` if `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`, otherwise `cur` remains `M1 - 2`, and `nums_left` remains `L[-1] - 4`. `M1` is greater than 1. `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be at least 3.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1.
- Initially, `nums_left` was `L[-1] - 3`.
- After decrementing, `nums_left` becomes `L[-1] - 4`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
