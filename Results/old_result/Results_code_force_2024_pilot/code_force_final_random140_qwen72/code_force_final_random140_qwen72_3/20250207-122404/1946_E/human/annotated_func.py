#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0).
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values, `d` and `c`, which are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`. The values of `d` and `c` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are derived from the integers `a` and `b` where `b > 0` and `a < b`.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns the tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where 'a' is an integer greater than or equal to 'b', 'b' is a positive integer, and 'a' is divisible by 'b'. The second element of the tuple is the negative of the quotient of 'a' divided by 'b' minus 1.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b. Additionally, a is not divisible by b (i.e., a % b ≠ 0).
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns the value of `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. Given that `a` and `b` are integers with `b > 0` and `a >= b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b` (i.e., `a % b ≠ 0`), `d` and `c` are the results of the function `func_1` applied to `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The final returned values are `d` and the calculated expression `c - a // b * d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` where `b >= 0` and returns a tuple of two integers. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`:

1. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0)`.
2. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the results of `func_1(b, a)` as a tuple `(d, c)`.
3. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
4. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`, it returns `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a list of integers where 1 <= len(b) <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where `c` is a value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and `a` is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` as inputs. It computes a value `c` by calling another function `func_1` with `b` and a constant `1000000007`. The function then returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`. After the function concludes, the original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function's return value is the computed result.
