Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The functions seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. However, these functions do not solve the problem described in the problem statement, which requires counting permutations based on specific conditions.

To illustrate, consider the following test case from the example:

Input:
```
6
1 1 1
1
1
4 2 3
1 2
2 3 4
3 3 1
1 2 3
3
5 3 4
1 2 3
2 3 4 5
20 5 4
1 2 3 4 12
12 13 18 20
6 2 3
1 3
3 4 6
```

The expected output is:
```
1
3
1
0
317580808
10
```

The provided functions do not handle the logic required to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
