Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` as inputs. It computes a value `c` by calling another function `func_1` with `b` and a constant `1000000007`. The function then returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`. After the function concludes, the original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function's return value is the computed result. **
