Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`. `i` is `R[0] + 3` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `ans` remains unchanged and `cur` is now 4. If `i != R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` and `cur` is now 3.**
