Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` where `b >= 0` and returns a tuple of two integers. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`:

1. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0)`.
2. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the results of `func_1(b, a)` as a tuple `(d, c)`.
3. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
4. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`, it returns `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`. **
