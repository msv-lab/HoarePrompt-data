### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of possible permutations of length `n` given the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - A prefix maximum is an element that is greater than all previous elements.
   - A suffix maximum is an element that is greater than all subsequent elements.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients (x, y) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
     - If \(b == 0\), it returns \((1, 0)\).
     - If \(a < b\), it swaps \(a\) and \(b\) and calls itself recursively.
     - If \(a \% b == 0\), it returns \((1, -(a // b - 1))\).
     - Otherwise, it continues the recursion with \(b\) and \(a \% b\).
   - **func_2(a, b):** This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It returns \(c \times a \% 1000000007\).

3. **Evaluating the Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program involves:
     - Precomputing factorials up to \(200002\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - Reading the number of test cases and processing each test case.
     - Checking if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, the number of valid permutations is 0.
     - Calculating the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic.
     - Using the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse function to compute the binomial coefficients.

4. **Validation of the Main Logic:**
   - The program correctly checks the boundary conditions for the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The combinatorial calculations are performed using the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse function.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct and necessary for the combinatorial calculations.
   - The main logic of the program correctly implements the required steps to count the number of valid permutations.
   - The program handles edge cases and multiple test cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
- The provided functions are correct in their implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular inverse calculation.
- The main logic of the program correctly solves the permutation problem as described.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program in solving the specific problem is **True**.

Final: **True**
