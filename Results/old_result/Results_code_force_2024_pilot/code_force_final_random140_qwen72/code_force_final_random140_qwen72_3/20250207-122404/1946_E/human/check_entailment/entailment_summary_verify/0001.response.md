### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of possible permutations of length `n` given the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - A prefix maximum is an element that is greater than all previous elements.
   - A suffix maximum is an element that is greater than all subsequent elements.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients (x, y) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
     - If \(b == 0\), it returns \((1, 0)\).
     - If \(a < b\), it swaps \(a\) and \(b\) and calls itself recursively.
     - If \(a \% b == 0\), it returns \((1, -(a // b - 1))\).
     - Otherwise, it continues the recursion with \(b\) and \(a \% b\).
   - **func_2(a, b):** This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It returns \(c \times a \% 1000000007\).

3. **Evaluating the Functions:**
   - **func_1:** The function correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is essential for finding the modular inverse.
   - **func_2:** This function correctly computes the modular inverse using the result from `func_1`.

4. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of valid permutations, which involves combinatorial calculations and possibly modular arithmetic.
   - The functions provided are related to modular arithmetic, which is necessary for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the specified modulo.
   - However, the main logic for solving the problem (counting valid permutations) is not provided in the given code. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are helper functions but do not directly solve the problem.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions are mathematically sound and correctly implement the necessary algorithms for modular arithmetic.
   - However, the main logic for solving the permutation problem is missing.

### Final Evaluation:
- The provided functions are correct in their implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular inverse calculation.
- However, the main logic for solving the permutation problem is not present in the given code.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program in solving the specific problem is **False** because the main logic is not present.

Final: **False**
