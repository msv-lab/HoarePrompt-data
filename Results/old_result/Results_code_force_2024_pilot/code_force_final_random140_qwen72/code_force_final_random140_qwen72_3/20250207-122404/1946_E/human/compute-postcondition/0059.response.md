Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is now `(ans * (N - R[0] - 3)) % MOD`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`. `i` is `R[0] + 3` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `M2` is greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans` to `(ans * (N - R[0] - 3)) % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
