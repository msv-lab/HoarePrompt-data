Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, the following conditions hold:**

- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N.
- Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]).
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and it has been updated multiple times within the loop based on the condition `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` whenever `i` does not match any value in `L`.
- `cur` is `-1` because the loop decrements `cur` each time `i` matches a value in `L`, and it starts from `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `0` because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, starting from `L[-1] - 2`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `1` because the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, starting from `L[-1] - 1`.

**Explanation:**
- The loop continues as long as `i > 1`.
- In each iteration, if `i` matches a value in `L`, `cur` is decremented by 1.
- If `i` does not match a value in `L`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- `nums_left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop stops when `i` reaches 1, meaning `i` has been decremented from `L[-1] - 1` down to 1.
- `cur` starts at `M1 - 2` and is decremented each time `i` matches a value in `L`, eventually reaching `-1` if all values in `L` are matched.
- `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented to 0 by the end of the loop.
