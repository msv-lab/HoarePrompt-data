Output State: **The program returns the value of `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. Given that `a` and `b` are integers with `b > 0` and `a >= b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b` (i.e., `a % b â‰  0`), `d` and `c` are the results of the function `func_1` applied to `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The final returned values are `d` and the calculated expression `c - a // b * d`.**
