Functionality: ** The function `func_2` processes two strictly increasing lists of integers, `L` and `R`, along with integers `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. It checks several conditions and returns 0 if any of the following are true: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is not 1, the last element of `R` is not `N`, or if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If none of these conditions are met, the function computes a result based on the values in `L` and `R`, using a helper function `func_1` and a loop to update the result. The final result, `ans`, is returned, which is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and additional multiplications, modulo `MOD`, if `M2 > 1`. If `M2 â‰¤ 1`, the result is simply the output of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. **
