The code snippet `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` of list `b` to the list `bd`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `len(b) + 1`
- `a` has `len(a)` elements
- `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`
- `b` must have at least `len(b) + 2` elements
- `bd` now includes the differences `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b)] - b[len(b) - 1]`

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is `len(b) + 1`.
2. The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` attempts to append the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to `bd`.
3. Since `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `b[i]` refers to the element at index `len(b) + 1`, which is out of bounds because the last valid index of `b` is `len(b) - 1`.

Therefore, the code will raise an `IndexError` because `b[i]` is out of range.

Output State: **`i` is `len(b) + 1`, `a` has `len(a)` elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `b` must have at least `len(b) + 2` elements, `bd` now includes the differences `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b)] - b[len(b) - 1]`. An `IndexError` is raised.**
