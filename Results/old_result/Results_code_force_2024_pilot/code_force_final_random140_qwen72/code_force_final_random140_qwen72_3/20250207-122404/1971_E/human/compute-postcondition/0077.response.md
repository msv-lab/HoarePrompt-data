The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `a` must have at least 3 elements for the loop condition `i < len(a)` to be true.

State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the first integer read from the input.**
