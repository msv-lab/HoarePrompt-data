The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the loop iterations, and `t`, which defines the number of iterations. To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` should start from 0 (or 1, depending on the context, but typically starts from 0 in Python).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, ensuring that `t` is always greater than 0.
- No specific initial value is given for `_`, but in a `for _ in range(t):` loop, `_` will automatically start from 0 and increment up to `t-1`.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
