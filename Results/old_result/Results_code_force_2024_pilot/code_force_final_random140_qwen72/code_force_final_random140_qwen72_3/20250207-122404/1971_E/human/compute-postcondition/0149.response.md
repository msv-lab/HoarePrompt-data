To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `a` has `len(a)` elements
- `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `b`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(b)` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, len(b))` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `len(b) - 1`, and this sequence will be non-empty only if `len(b) > 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` in the loop head is not relevant to the state before the loop starts. The loop will set `i` to 1 on the first iteration.
- **`b`**: For the loop to execute, `b` must have at least 2 elements.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that `b` has at least 2 elements. The value of `i` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition, but it will be set to 1 when the loop starts.

State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` has `len(a)` elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `b` must have at least 2 elements**
