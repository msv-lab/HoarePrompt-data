Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `bd` now includes the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` to the list `bd`.
- The length of `b` is at least `len(a) + 1`, ensuring that `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` are valid indices.
- The value of `i` is `len(a)`, which remains unchanged.
- The lists `a` and `ad` remain unchanged.
- The list `bd` is updated to include the new difference calculated from `b[i]` and `b[i-1]`.
