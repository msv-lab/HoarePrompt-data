Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least 2 elements, `bd` now includes the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i-1]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i-1]` to the list `bd`. The values of `a`, `i`, `ad`, and the condition that `b` must have at least 2 elements remain unchanged. The new element added to `bd` is the difference `b[i] - b[i-1]`.
