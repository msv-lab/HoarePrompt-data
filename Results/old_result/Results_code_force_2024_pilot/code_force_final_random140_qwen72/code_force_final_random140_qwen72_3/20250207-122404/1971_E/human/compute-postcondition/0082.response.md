To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the length of the list `b`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(b)` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b) - 1`).

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- The list `b` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
- `a` remains as described: a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `i` remains as `len(a) - 1`.
- `ad` remains as a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`.
- `b` must have at least 2 elements.

### State:
**`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least 2 elements**
