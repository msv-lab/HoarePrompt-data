Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, representing the final destination, the number of known time points, and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n, representing the positions of the signs. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, representing the times when the car reaches the corresponding positions in a. Each of the q queries is an integer d where 0 ≤ d ≤ n, representing the distance for which the time is queried. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. `n`, `k`, and `q` retain their last assigned values from the last test case. `a` and `b` are lists of length `k + 1` (including the initial 0), representing the positions and times, respectively. `ad` and `bd` are lists of length `k` containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. `v` is a list of length `k + 1` containing the speeds calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `k`. `l` is `q - 1`, indicating the last query has been processed. `m` is the last computed value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` for the last query. `ql` is the last updated value of the query distance minus `a[s - 1]`. `s` is the index where the last `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. The values of `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
