The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `a`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 3), and `a` must still have enough elements for the loop condition to be true. Therefore, `a` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the first integer read from the input and the difference between the third element and the second element of `a`.**
