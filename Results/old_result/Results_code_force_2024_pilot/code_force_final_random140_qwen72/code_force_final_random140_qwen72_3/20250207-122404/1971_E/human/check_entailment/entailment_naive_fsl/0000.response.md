Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has an issue in how it calculates the time for the query points. Specifically, the calculation of `m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` is incorrect because it does not properly handle the division and rounding down to the nearest integer.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
10 2 4
4 10
4 7
6
4
2
7
```

### Expected Output:
```
5 4 2 5
```

### Actual Output:
```
5 4 2 5
```

However, let's consider another case:

### Input:
```
1
10 2 1
4 10
4 7
3
```

### Expected Output:
```
3
```

### Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, the car travels from point 0 to point 4 in 4 minutes (1 unit per minute) and from point 4 to point 10 in 3 minutes (2 units per minute). For the query at point 3, the expected time is 3 minutes, but the program outputs 2 minutes.

This discrepancy occurs because the program incorrectly calculates the time for points that fall within a segment. The correct approach would be to calculate the exact time and then round down to the nearest integer, which the current implementation does not do correctly.
