Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements, `bd` now includes the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`.
- The value of `i` is `len(a) + 1`, which means `i` is one more than the length of the list `a`.
- The list `b` must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements, ensuring that `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are valid indices.
- The list `bd` now includes the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]`.
- All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
