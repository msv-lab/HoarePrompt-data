Output State: **`i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` has `len(a)` elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `b` has `len(b)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(b) - 1`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `len(b) - 1`.
- The list `bd` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from `b[1] - b[0]` to `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`.
- The variables `a` and `ad` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
