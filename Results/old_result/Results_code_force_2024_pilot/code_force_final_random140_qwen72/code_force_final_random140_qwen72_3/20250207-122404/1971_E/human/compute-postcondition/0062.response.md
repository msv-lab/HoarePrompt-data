Postcondition: ***`a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` must be greater than 2, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `ql` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence. Otherwise, the program continues as usual with the same state of variables.***
