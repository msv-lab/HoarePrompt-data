Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` is initially set to `len(a) - 1` and does not change during the loop execution.
- The variable `ad` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements for the loop to complete all its iterations without raising an index error.
- The variable `bd` is updated in each iteration to include the difference between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`. After the loop completes, `bd` will contain these differences for all elements of `b` except the first one.
