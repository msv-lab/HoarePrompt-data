Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, `a[3] - a[2]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` to the list `ad`. Since `i` is 3, the new element added to `ad` is `a[3] - a[2]`. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
