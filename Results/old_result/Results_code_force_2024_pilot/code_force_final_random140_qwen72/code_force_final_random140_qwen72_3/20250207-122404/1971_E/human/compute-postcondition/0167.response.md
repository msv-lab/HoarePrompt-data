Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ql`. This means `ql` now holds an integer value provided by the user. The other variables (`q`, `l`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
