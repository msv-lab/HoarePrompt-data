### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the positions `a` and the corresponding times `b` for these points.
   - It initializes lists `ad` and `bd` to store the differences in positions and times between consecutive points, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `v` to store the speeds between consecutive points.

2. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The speed `v[i]` between points `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` is calculated as `(a[i] - a[i-1]) / (b[i] - b[i-1])`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it reads the distance `ql` and uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where `ql` lies.
   - If `ql` is exactly at one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by adding the time to reach the previous known point and the time to travel the remaining distance within the current segment.

4. **Time Calculation**:
   - The time to reach `ql` is calculated as `m = b[s-1] + (ql - a[s-1]) * bd[s] // ad[s]`, where `s` is the index of the segment found by `bisect_left`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Binary Search Usage**: The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the segment where the query point `ql` lies. This ensures efficient lookup in O(log k) time.
- **Time Calculation**: The formula `m = b[s-1] + (ql - a[s-1]) * bd[s] // ad[s]` correctly calculates the time to reach `ql` by considering the time to reach the previous known point and the additional time to travel the remaining distance within the current segment.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `ql` is exactly at one of the known points, the program correctly prints the corresponding time.
  - When `ql` is between two known points, the program correctly calculates the time using the formula and rounds down as required.

### Annotations Validation:

- **Initial State**: The initial state of the program is correctly described, with `t` being the number of test cases and the subsequent inputs being parsed correctly.
- **Segment Differences**: The lists `ad` and `bd` are correctly populated with the differences in positions and times, respectively.
- **Speed Calculation**: The list `v` is correctly populated with the speeds between consecutive points.
- **Query Processing**: The binary search and time calculation logic are correctly implemented and match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, uses binary search efficiently, and calculates the time to reach the query points accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
