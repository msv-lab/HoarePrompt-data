The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `a` must have at least 3 elements for the loop condition to still be true.

State: **`i` is 2, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `ad` contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`**
