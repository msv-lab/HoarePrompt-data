Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`.
- Since `i` is 3, the value appended to `ad` is `a[3] - a[2]`.
- The list `ad` now contains the integers 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
