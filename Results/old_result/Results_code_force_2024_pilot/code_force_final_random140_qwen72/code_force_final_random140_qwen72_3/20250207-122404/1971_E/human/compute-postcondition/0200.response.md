To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `m`.

### Initial State:
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 2.
- `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. This means `s` is the position in `a` such that `a[s-1] <= ql < a[s]`.

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - After determining `s`, `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Compute `m`:**
   - `m` is computed using the formula: `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
   - Here, `b[s - 1]` is the element at index `s - 1` in the list `b`.
   - `bd[s]` is the element at index `s` in the list `bd`.
   - `ad[s]` is the element at index `s` in the list `ad`.
   - `(ql - a[s - 1])` is the difference between the updated `ql` and the element at index `s - 1` in the list `a`.
   - The expression `(ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` performs integer division.

### Final Output:
The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space. Since the exact values of the lists `a`, `b`, `bd`, and `ad` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, based on the given formula and the initial state, the output will be:

Output: **m (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s], with s being the index where ql should be inserted in the list a to maintain sorted order, and ql is updated to ql - a[s - 1])**
