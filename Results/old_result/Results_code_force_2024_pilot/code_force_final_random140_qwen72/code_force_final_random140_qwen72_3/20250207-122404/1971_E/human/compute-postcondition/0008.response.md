The code snippet `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the second element and the first element of the list `a` to the list `ad`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `t` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `q` remains an input integer.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input.
- `ad` initially contains only the integer 0. After the code execution, `ad` will contain two elements: 0 and the difference between the second element and the first element of `a`.
- `bd` remains a list containing only the integer 0.
- `i` is 1.

The difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is `a[1] - a[0]`. Since `a[0]` is 0, this simplifies to `a[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input, `ad` is a list containing [0, `a[1]`], `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 1.**
