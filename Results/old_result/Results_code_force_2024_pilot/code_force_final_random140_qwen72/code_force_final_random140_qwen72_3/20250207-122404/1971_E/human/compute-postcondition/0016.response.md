Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing the integers 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the difference between the last element of `b` (at index `i`) and the second-to-last element of `b` (at index `i - 1`) to the list `bd`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
