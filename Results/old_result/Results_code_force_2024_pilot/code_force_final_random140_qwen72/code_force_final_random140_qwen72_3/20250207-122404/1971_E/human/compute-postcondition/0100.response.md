The code snippet `ql = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `ql`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the new value to `ql`.

Output State: **`a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer.**
