To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is 0.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. This means `s` is the position in `a` such that `a[s-1] <= ql < a[s]`.

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. This means `ql` is reduced by the value of `a[s - 1]`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`.
   - Here, `b[s - 1]` is the value at index `s - 1` in the list `b`.
   - `bd[s]` is the value at index `s` in the list `bd`.
   - `ad[s]` is the value at index `s` in the list `ad`.
   - `(ql // ad[s])` is the integer division of `ql` by `ad[s]`.

### Final Output:
- The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for the lists and variables:
- `a = [1, 3, 5, 7]`
- `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`
- `bd = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `ad = [2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `ql = 6`

1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index where `6` should be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order. Since `a[1] = 3` and `a[2] = 5`, `s` is 2.

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - `ql = 6 - a[s - 1] = 6 - 3 = 3`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`
   - `b[s - 1] = b[1] = 20`
   - `bd[s] = bd[2] = 3`
   - `ad[s] = ad[2] = 4`
   - `ql // ad[s] = 3 // 4 = 0`
   - `m = 20 + 3 * 0 = 20`

### Final Output:
Output: **20**
