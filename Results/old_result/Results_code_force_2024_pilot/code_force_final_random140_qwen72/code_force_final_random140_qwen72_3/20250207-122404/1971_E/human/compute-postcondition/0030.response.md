The only objects in the loop head are the variable `l` and the variable `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other states (`a`, `i`, `v`) do not affect the loop's ability to start, but they are part of the initial state.

For the loop to execute, `q` must be greater than 0, and `l` should start at 0.

State: **`a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0**
