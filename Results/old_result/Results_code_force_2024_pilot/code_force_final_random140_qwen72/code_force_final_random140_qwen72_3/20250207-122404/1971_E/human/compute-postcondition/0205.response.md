Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a car journey with known positions and times. It accepts inputs for the number of test cases (`t`), the final destination (`n`), the number of known time points (`k`), and the number of queries (`q`). For each test case, it reads the positions of the signs (`a`) and the times when the car reaches these positions (`b`). The function then calculates the time it takes to reach specific distances for each of the `q` queries and prints these times. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the variables `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` in their final states, with `t` being 0, indicating all test cases have been processed. **
