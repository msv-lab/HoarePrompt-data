Output State: **`a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ql`.
- All other variables (`a`, `i`, `v`, `q`, `l`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial conditions for `a`, `i`, `v`, `q`, `l`, and `m` are still valid.
- The new variable `ql` is an integer input by the user.
