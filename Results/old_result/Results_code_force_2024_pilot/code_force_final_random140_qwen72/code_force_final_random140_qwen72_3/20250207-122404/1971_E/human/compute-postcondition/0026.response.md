Output State: **`a` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `v` is a list that now includes the values `a[1] / b[1]` and `ad[2] / bd[2]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Since `i` is 2, the value `ad[2] / bd[2]` is appended to `v`. The initial state specified that `v` already included the value `a[1] / b[1]`, so now `v` contains both `a[1] / b[1]` and `ad[2] / bd[2]`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
