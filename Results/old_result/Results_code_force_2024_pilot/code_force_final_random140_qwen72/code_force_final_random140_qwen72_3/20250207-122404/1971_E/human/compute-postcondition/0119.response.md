Output State: **`a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `q` must be at least 2, `l` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `ql` is now the integer value input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`. If `a[s] == ql`, then the state of the program remains unchanged as described above.**
