The code snippet appends the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a` to the list `ad`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]` and `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements, `ad` contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`.**
