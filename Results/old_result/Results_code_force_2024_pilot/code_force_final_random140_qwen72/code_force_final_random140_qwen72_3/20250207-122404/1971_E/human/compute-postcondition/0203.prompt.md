Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, representing the final destination, the number of known time points, and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n, representing the positions of the signs. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, representing the times when the car reaches the corresponding positions in a. Each of the q queries is an integer d where 0 ≤ d ≤ n, representing the distance for which the time is queried. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
        print(m, end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` is 0, `l` is `q` (the total number of iterations), `m` is the final computed value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for the last iteration, `ql` is the final value of the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]` for the last iteration, `s` is the index where the final `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to the final `ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence. Otherwise, the program continues as usual with the updated value of `ql`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements. `i` is 1. `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`. `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements. `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`. `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`. `q` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. `l` is `q - 1`. For each iteration, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `ql` is updated to the integer value input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`. If `a[s] == ql`, the program prints `b[s]` and skips the rest of the current iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `l` is `q - 1`, `m` is the last computed value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is the last updated value of `ql - a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index where the last `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. The values of `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
