Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` is the input integer `q`, `l` is `q` (the total number of iterations), `m` is the final computed value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for the last iteration, `ql` is the final value of the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]` for the last iteration, `s` is the index where the final `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order, `n` is the input integer `n`, `k` is the input integer `k`, `_` is incremented to the next value in the range `0` to `t-1`, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `ad` is `[0]`, `bd` is `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the first integer read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the first integer read from the input and the difference between the third element and the second element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the first integer read from the input, the difference between the third element and the second element of `a`, and the difference between the fourth element and the third element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
