To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- `bd` is a list containing the integers 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue if `i` is less than `len(b)`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. Increment `i` by 1.
2. Ensure that `i` is still less than `len(b)` for the loop to execute again.

### New State:
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- The loop will execute again if `len(a) < len(b)`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing the integers 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `len(a)`, `len(a) < len(b)`**
