Output State: **`a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration or the next statement in the sequence. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
