The code snippet `a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list `a` that starts with 0 followed by these integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `q` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `a` is now a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input.**
