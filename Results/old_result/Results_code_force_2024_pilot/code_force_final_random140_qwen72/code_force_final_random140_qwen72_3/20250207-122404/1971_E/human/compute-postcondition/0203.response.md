Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. `n`, `k`, and `q` retain their last assigned values from the last test case. `a` and `b` are lists of length `k + 1` (including the initial 0), representing the positions and times, respectively. `ad` and `bd` are lists of length `k` containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. `v` is a list of length `k + 1` containing the speeds calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `k`. `l` is `q - 1`, indicating the last query has been processed. `m` is the last computed value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` for the last query. `ql` is the last updated value of the query distance minus `a[s - 1]`. `s` is the index where the last `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. The values of `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
