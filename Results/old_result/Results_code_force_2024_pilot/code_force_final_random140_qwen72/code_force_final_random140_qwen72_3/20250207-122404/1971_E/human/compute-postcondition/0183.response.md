The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the provided code snippet, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.**
