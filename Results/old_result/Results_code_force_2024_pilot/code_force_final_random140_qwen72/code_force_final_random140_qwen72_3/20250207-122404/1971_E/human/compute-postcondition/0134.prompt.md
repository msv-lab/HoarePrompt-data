Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements. `i` is 1. `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`. `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements. `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`. `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`. `q` must be greater than 0. `l` is 0. `m` is now `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`. `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`. `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop or conditional block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `q` must be at least 2, `l` is 1, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `ql` is now the integer value input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`. If `a[s] == ql`, then the state of the program remains unchanged as described above.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `q` must be at least 3, `l` is 2, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
