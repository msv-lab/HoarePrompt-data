The code snippet `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the third element and the second element of the list `a` to the list `ad`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `q` is an input integer
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input
- `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and `a[1] - a[0]`
- `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0
- `i` is 2

After executing the code:
- The value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is calculated, which is `a[2] - a[1]`.
- This value is appended to the list `ad`.

Therefore, the updated list `ad` will be `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, and `a[2] - a[1]`, `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 2.**
