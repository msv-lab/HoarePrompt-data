The code appends the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 1, the difference is calculated between `a[1]` and `a[0]`.

Since `a` starts with 0 and is followed by integers read from the input, `a[0]` is 0, and `a[1]` is the first integer read from the input. Therefore, the value appended to `ad` is `a[1] - 0`, which is simply `a[1]`.

The value of `i` remains 1, and the list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the first integer read from the input.**
