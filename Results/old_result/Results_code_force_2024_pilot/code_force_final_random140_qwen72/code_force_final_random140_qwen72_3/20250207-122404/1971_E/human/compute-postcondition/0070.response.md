The code snippet `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q` respectively. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` is the input integer `q`, `l` is `q` (the total number of iterations), `m` is the final computed value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` for the last iteration, `ql` is the final value of the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]` for the last iteration, `s` is the index where the final `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order, `n` is the input integer `n`, `k` is the input integer `k`, `_` is incremented to the next value in the range `0` to `t-1`.**
