Output State: **`a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements. `i` is 1. `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`. `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements. `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`. `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`. `q` must be greater than 0. `l` is 0. `m` is 0. `ql` is an input integer. `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`. Additionally, the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop or conditional block.**
