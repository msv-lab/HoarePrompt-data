The code snippet appends the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `b` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is `len(a) + 1` and `len(a) < len(b)`, `i` is within the bounds of `b`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `bd` originally contains the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- The new value being appended to `bd` is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is `len(a) + 1`, the new value being appended is the difference between the `(len(a) + 1)`-th element of `b` and the `len(a)`-th element of `b`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` followed by `b[len(a) + 1] - b[len(a)]`, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `len(a) < len(b)`**.
