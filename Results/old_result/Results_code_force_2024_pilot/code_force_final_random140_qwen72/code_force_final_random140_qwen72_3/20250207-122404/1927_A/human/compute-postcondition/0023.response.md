The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given context, it is implied that the function should accept parameters for the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the strip (`n`), and the string representing the strip (`s`). The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one cell being black.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the result is not specified in the problem statement, but it is implied that the function will return some form of output based on the processing of the strip.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters for the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the strip (`n`), and the string representing the strip (`s`). It processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The result is based on the processing of the strip, which consists of characters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black).**
