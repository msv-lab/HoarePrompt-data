The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B'. It calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be painted to cover all black cells ('B') in the string `s` and prints this value for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `s` for each test case are processed and discarded.
