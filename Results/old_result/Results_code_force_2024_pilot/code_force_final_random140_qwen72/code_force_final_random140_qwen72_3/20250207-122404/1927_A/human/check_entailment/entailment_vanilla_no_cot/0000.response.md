Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it finds the positions of the first and last black cells ('B') in the string and calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. This is done by computing `last_black - first_black + 1`, which gives the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive. This approach ensures that all black cells are covered, and no unnecessary white cells are included in the segment, making it the minimum possible length. The program then prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output format.
