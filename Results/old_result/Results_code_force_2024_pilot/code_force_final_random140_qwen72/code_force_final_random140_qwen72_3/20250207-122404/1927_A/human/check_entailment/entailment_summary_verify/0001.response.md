Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Finding Black Cells**: The use of `s.find('B')` and `s.rfind('B')` to find the indices of the first and last black cells is appropriate. These functions return the correct indices, and the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so these functions will always return valid indices.

3. **Calculating Minimum Segment Length**: The calculation `last_black - first_black + 1` is correct. This formula computes the length of the segment that includes all black cells, from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.

4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated minimum length for each test case, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the strip consists entirely of white cells, the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this case does not need to be handled separately.
   - If there is only one black cell, the segment length will be 1, which is correct.
   - If the strip has multiple black cells, the function correctly identifies the segment that covers all black cells with the minimum length.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function handles all edge cases and correctly computes the minimum segment length for each test case.

Final: **True**
