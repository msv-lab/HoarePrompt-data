Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. It finds the first and last occurrence of 'B' (black cell) in the string and calculates the length of the segment between these two indices, inclusive. This approach ensures that all black cells are covered, and no unnecessary white cells are included in the segment to be painted. The program handles all edge cases, such as when there is only one black cell, or when black cells are at the beginning or end of the string. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential inputs.
