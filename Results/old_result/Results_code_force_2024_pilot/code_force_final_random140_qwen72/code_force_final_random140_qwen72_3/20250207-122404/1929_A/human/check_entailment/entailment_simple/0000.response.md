Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.

### Key Points:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `ar` before computing the beauty. Sorting ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is crucial for maximizing the beauty. This is because the beauty is the sum of positive differences, and sorting arranges the elements in ascending order, making the differences as small as possible.

2. **Summing Differences**: The program calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements using a list comprehension and prints the result.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
  - Output: `57` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: 
  - Input: `n = 4`, `a = [3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: 
  - Input: `n = 2`, `a = [2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the elements and summing the differences between consecutive elements. It handles multiple test cases as expected.
