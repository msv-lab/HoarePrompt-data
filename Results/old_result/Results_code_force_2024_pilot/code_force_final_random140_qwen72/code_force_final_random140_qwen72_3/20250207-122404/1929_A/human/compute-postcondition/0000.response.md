The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop. This input value should be at least 1 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be at least 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
