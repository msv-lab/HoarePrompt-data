Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array elements are all the same. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array should be 0 if all elements are the same, but the current implementation will still attempt to sort the array and calculate the sum of differences, which will incorrectly result in 0 only because the differences between identical elements are 0. However, the issue is more about the logic of rearranging, which is unnecessary in this specific case. A more critical issue is that the program does not consider the possibility of maximizing the beauty by arranging the array in descending order, which would maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements. For example, for the input `[3, 3, 1, 2]`, the program will output `2` (after sorting to `[1, 2, 3, 3]`), but the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array as `[3, 3, 2, 1]`, resulting in a beauty of `3`. Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty for all inputs.
