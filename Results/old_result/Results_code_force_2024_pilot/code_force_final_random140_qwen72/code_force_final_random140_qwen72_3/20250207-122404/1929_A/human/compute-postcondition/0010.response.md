The code snippet `ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and assigns this sorted list to the variable `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder.
- The input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be at least 2.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ar_i ≤ 10^9 (updated from user input).

After executing the code snippet:
- `ar` is updated to a new sorted list of integers read from the input.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be at least 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `ar` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
