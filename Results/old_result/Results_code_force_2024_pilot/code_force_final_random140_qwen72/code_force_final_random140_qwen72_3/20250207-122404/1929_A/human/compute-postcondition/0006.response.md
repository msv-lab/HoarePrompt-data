The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and assigns this sorted list to the variable `ar`.

- The variable `ar` is updated to be a sorted list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.
- The initial state specifies that `ar` was already a sorted list of `n` integers, but the new `ar` is now the sorted version of the input integers, which may or may not be different from the original `ar`.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be at least 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ar_i ≤ 10^9 (updated from user input).**
