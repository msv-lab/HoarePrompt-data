You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations as determined by the initial input value `t`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not retain any specific value. For each of the `t` test cases, `n` was an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` was a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. After sorting, `ar` was a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ar_i ≤ 10^9. The loop printed the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in `ar` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the list of integers and prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The formula for beauty is \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Optimal Rearrangement**: To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order. This ensures that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are positive and as large as possible.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
     - Sorted array: `1 2 3`
     - Beauty: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - Output: `2` (Correct)
   - **Example 2**: Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
     - Sorted array: `69 69 69`
     - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
     - Output: `0` (Correct)
   - **Example 3**: Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
     - Sorted array: `43 54 80 90 100`
     - Beauty: \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)
     - Output: `57` (Correct)
   - **Example 4**: Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
     - Sorted array: `3 3 3 4`
     - Beauty: \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
     - Output: `1` (Correct)
   - **Example 5**: Input: `2`, `2 1`
     - Sorted array: `1 2`
     - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
     - Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Conclusion**: The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The examples provided also confirm that the program produces the correct output.
