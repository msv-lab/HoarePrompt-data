Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The formula for beauty is \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Optimal Rearrangement**: To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order. This ensures that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are positive and as large as possible.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
     - Sorted array: `1 2 3`
     - Beauty: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - Output: `2` (Correct)
   - **Example 2**: Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
     - Sorted array: `69 69 69`
     - Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
     - Output: `0` (Correct)
   - **Example 3**: Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
     - Sorted array: `43 54 80 90 100`
     - Beauty: \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)
     - Output: `57` (Correct)
   - **Example 4**: Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
     - Sorted array: `3 3 3 4`
     - Beauty: \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
     - Output: `1` (Correct)
   - **Example 5**: Input: `2`, `2 1`
     - Sorted array: `1 2`
     - Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)
     - Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Conclusion**: The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The examples provided also confirm that the program produces the correct output.
