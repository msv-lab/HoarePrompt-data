To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq ar_i \leq 10^9\) (updated from user input).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `ar`**: This is a sorted list of `n` integers. Since it is sorted, the elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]` calculates the difference between each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list `ar`.
   - For example, if `ar = [1, 3, 6, 10]`, the differences would be:
     - `ar[1] - ar[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`
     - `ar[2] - ar[1] = 6 - 3 = 3`
     - `ar[3] - ar[2] = 10 - 6 = 4`
   - The resulting list would be `[2, 3, 4]`.
3. **Sum of Differences**: The `sum` function then adds up all the differences calculated in the list comprehension.
   - For the example above, the sum would be `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the sum of the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list `ar`.

Output: **sum of the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list `ar` (where `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers)**

This output is the most precise description based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
