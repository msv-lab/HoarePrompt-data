Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be at least 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ar_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is updated to the value provided by the user input, which is an integer between 2 and 100.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
