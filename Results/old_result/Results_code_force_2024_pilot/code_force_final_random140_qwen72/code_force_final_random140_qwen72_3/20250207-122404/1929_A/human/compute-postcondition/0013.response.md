The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters: `t` and a list of lists `a`, where `t` represents the number of test cases (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `a` is a list containing `t` sublists, each of which contains `n` integers (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function processes these inputs and returns some result based on the values in the list `a` for each test case.
