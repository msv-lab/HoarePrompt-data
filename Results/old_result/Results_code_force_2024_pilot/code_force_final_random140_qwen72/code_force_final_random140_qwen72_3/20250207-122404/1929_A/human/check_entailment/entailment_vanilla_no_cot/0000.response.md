Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This approach leverages the fact that the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order, as this maximizes the positive differences between consecutive elements. The solution handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
