The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `i` being less than the value provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and the value provided by `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `e` is a non-empty input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`.**
