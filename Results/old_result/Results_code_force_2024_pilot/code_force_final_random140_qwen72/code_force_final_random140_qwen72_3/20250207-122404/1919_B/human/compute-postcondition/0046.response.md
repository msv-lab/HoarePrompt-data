Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `e` is a new input string, `P` is 0, and `M` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `M = 0` reassigns the value of `M` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the number of '-' characters in the new `e`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
