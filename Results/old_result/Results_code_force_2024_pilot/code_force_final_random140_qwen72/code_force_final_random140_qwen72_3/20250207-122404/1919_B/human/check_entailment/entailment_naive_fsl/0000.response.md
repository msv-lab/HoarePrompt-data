Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and outputs the absolute value of this difference. This approach does not account for the requirement to split the array into subarrays and calculate the penalty based on the sum of these subarrays.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0
```

However, the program's logic is flawed because it does not attempt to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. For the input `+-+-+-`, the optimal way to split the array is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, which results in a penalty of `0`. The program, however, does not perform this splitting and instead just calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which happens to be `0` in this specific case but would fail in other cases.

For example, consider the input `--++++`:

**Input:**
```
1
6
--++++
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

In this case, the optimal way to split the array is `([-1,-1],[1,1,1,1])`, resulting in a penalty of `2 * 2 + 4 * 0 = 4`. However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
