Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. However, the program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e` and prints the absolute difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty, which is a crucial part of the problem.

The correct approach should involve a more sophisticated algorithm that considers different ways to split the array and calculates the penalty for each possible split to find the minimum penalty. The current implementation does not perform any splitting of the array and thus cannot produce the correct minimum penalty for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
