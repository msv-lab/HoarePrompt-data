The value of `M` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `M` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `q`. If `q` is '+', then `M` was initially 0, and now it becomes 1. If `q` is not '+', then `M` was initially 1, and now it becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `e`, `q`, and `P` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `e` is a non-empty input string, `q` is the next character in `e`, `P` is 0 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `P` is 1, `M` is 1 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 2.**
