Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`. However, this approach does not correctly implement the required logic for minimizing the penalty as described in the problem statement. The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of the penalties of each subarray. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The current implementation simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters and prints it, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. For example, in the case where the input string is `"+-+-+"`, the optimal way to split the array to get a penalty of 0 is to split it into `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1]` or `[1, -1, 1, -1]` and `[1]`, but the program will output `1` instead of `0`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
