The value of `M` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `M` is 0 if `q` is not '+', or 2 if `q` is '+'. Therefore, the new value of `M` will be 1 if `q` is not '+', or 3 if `q` is '+'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `e` is a non-empty input string, `q` is the next character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 3. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
