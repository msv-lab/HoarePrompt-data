The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If there are more characters left in `e`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `q` is the first character of the string `e`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be the next character in the string `e`, and `i` (which is not part of the loop head but mentioned in the state) would incrementally move to the next position if it were being used as an index. However, since `i` is not part of the loop head, we do not adjust it here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `q` is now the second character of `e`, and `e` remains a non-empty input string with at least one character remaining to be processed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least one character remaining, `q` is the second character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
