Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is an input string, `P` is 0.** 

The variable `P` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `e`) retain their initial values.
