To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for q in e:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Objects in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `q` and the iterable `e`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, the iterable `e` must contain at least one element. If `e` is empty, the loop will not run.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The state of `e` must be adjusted to ensure it is not empty. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `P`, and `M`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `e` must be a non-empty string. The other variables can remain as they are.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `e` is a non-empty input string, `P` is 0, and `M` is 0**
