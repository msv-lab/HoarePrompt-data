The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If there are characters left in `e`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least one character remaining, and `q` is the second character of `e`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `e` must still have at least one character remaining. Since `q` is the second character of `e` at the start of the current iteration, for the next iteration, `q` will be the third character of `e`. Therefore, `e` must have at least three characters for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least two characters remaining, `q` is the third character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
