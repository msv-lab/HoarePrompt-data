Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and outputs this difference. This approach does not account for the requirement to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

The key issue is that the program does not implement the logic to split the array into subarrays and calculate the penalty based on the sum of these subarrays. Instead, it directly computes the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the penalty calculation required by the problem.

To further validate this, let's consider another example:

**Input:**
```
1
8
--++--++
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0
```

In this case, the optimal way to split the array is `([-1,-1,1,1],[-1,1,1,-1])`, which results in a penalty of `0`. The program, however, does not perform this splitting and instead just calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which happens to be `0` in this specific case but would fail in other cases.

Another example:

**Input:**
```
1
7
-++-+++
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

In this case, the optimal way to split the array is `([-1,1,1],[-1,1,1,1])`, which results in a penalty of `1 * 3 + 2 * 4 = 3`. However, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.

Given these examples, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the required logic to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into subarrays. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
