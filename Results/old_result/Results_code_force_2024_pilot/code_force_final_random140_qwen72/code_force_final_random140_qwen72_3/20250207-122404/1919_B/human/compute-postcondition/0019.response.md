Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is a non-empty input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`.
- For each character `q`:
  - If `q` is '+', the variable `P` (which counts the number of '+' characters) is incremented by 1.
  - If `q` is '-', the variable `M` (which counts the number of '-' characters) is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `P` will hold the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` will hold the total number of '-' characters in the string `e`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
