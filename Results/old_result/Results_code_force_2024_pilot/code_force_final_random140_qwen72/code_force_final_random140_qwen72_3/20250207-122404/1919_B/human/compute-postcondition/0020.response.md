Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
- `s` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `e` is a non-empty input string.
- `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`.
- `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(abs(P - M))
```

### Explanation:
- `P` represents the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` represents the count of '-' characters in the string `e`.
- The expression `abs(P - M)` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `e`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **abs(P - M) (where P is the number of '+' characters in the string e and M is the number of '-' characters in the string e)**
