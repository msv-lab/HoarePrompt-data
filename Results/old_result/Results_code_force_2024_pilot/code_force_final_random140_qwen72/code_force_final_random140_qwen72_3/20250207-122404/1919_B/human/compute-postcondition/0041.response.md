To determine what will be printed by the `print(abs(P - M))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
- `s` is the integer value provided by the user input.
- `i` is 1.
- `e` is a non-empty input string.
- `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`.
- `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`.

The `print(abs(P - M))` statement calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of '-' characters (`M`) in the string `e`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Input String `e`**: This is a non-empty string that contains both '+' and '-' characters.
2. **Counting Characters**:
   - `P` is the count of '+' characters in `e`.
   - `M` is the count of '-' characters in `e`.
3. **Absolute Difference**:
   - The expression `abs(P - M)` computes the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.
4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(abs(P - M))` statement will output this absolute difference.

### Example Calculation:
- If `e = "++-++-"`, then:
  - `P = 4` (number of '+' characters)
  - `M = 2` (number of '-' characters)
  - `abs(P - M) = abs(4 - 2) = 2`

### Final Output:
The `print(abs(P - M))` statement will print the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **abs(P - M) (where P is the number of '+' characters in e and M is the number of '-' characters in e)**
