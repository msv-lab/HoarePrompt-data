The value of `P` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0, the new value of `P` will be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `e` is a non-empty input string, `q` is the next character in `e`, `P` is 2, `M` is 0.**
