To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is 0.
- `l` is the third element from `R()`.
- `r` is the fourth element from `R()`.
- `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `R()`**:
   - `R()` is a function that returns an iterable. The specific nature of this iterable is not provided, but we know it has at least four elements.
   - `l` is the third element from `R()`.
   - `r` is the fourth element from `R()`.
   - `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`.

2. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`.
   - The exact values of `a` depend on the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`.

3. **Variables `l` and `r`**:
   - `l` is the third element from `R()`.
   - `r` is the fourth element from `R()`.

4. **Condition `a[r] < l`**:
   - We need to check if the value at index `r` in the list `a` is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is true, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is false, the expression will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`.

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will unpack the tuple or list and print the elements separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
- If `a[r] < l` is true, the output will be `-1 -1`.
- If `a[r] < l` is false, the output will be `a[r] r`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **-1 -1 (if a[r] < l) or a[r] r (if a[r] >= l)**
