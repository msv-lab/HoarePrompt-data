The code snippet `a += j` modifies the list `a` by appending the value of `j` to it. Let's analyze the impact on the program:

- `t` remains a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3.
- `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` was initially `[0, 0, 1]` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `[0, 0, 0]`.
- `q` remains 0.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0.
- `l` remains the first element from `R()`.
- `r` remains the second element from `R()`.
- `p` remains equal to the second element of the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `x` remains the third element of the iterable returned by `R()`.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `x` is not equal to `p`, `a` is `[0, 0, 1]` and `j` is 2. After executing `a += j`, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 2]`.
- If `x` is equal to `p`, `a` is `[0, 0, 0]` and `j` is 0. After executing `a += j`, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, 1, 2]` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the second element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `x` is the third element of the iterable returned by `R()`**.
