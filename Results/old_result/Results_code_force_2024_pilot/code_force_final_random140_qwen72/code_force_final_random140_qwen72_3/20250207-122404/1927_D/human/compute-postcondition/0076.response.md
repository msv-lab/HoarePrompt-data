Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0]`, `q` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = [0]` changes the value of `a` from `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` to `[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `i`, `j`, `l`, `r`, `p`) remain unchanged.
