The code snippet `j = (j, i)[x != p]` updates the value of `j` based on whether `x` is not equal to `p`. Let's break down the impact:

- `j` is initially 1 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise it is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is the next element from `R()`.
- `p` is the previous `x`.

If `x` is not equal to `p`, then `x != p` evaluates to `True` (which is equivalent to 1), and `j` will be set to `i`, which is 2.

If `x` is equal to `p`, then `x != p` evaluates to `False` (which is equivalent to 0), and `j` will remain the same as its initial value, which is 1 if `x` was not equal to `p` before, or 0 if `x` was equal to `p` before.

Therefore, the output state depends on the comparison `x != p`:

- If `x != p` is `True` (i.e., `x` is not equal to `p`):
  - `j` is updated to 2.
- If `x != p` is `False` (i.e., `x` is equal to `p`):
  - `j` remains 1 if `x` was not equal to `p` before, or 0 if `x` was equal to `p` before.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, j]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 1 if `x` was not equal to `p` before, or 0 if `x` was equal to `p` before, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is equal to the previous `x`, `x` is the next element from `R()`**.
