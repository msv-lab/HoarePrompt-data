Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2.
2. `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
3. `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
4. `q` is now `q - 3` and must be at least 2.
5. `i` is `n`.
6. `j` is `n-1`.
7. `l` is the first element from `R()`.
8. `r` is the second element from `R()`.
9. `p` is the last element from `R()`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` Construction**:
   - `a` is a list starting with two zeros followed by the sequence from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `a = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

2. **Variables `l`, `r`, and `p`**:
   - `l`, `r`, and `p` are elements from the function `R()`, which is not explicitly defined but is assumed to return a sequence of values.
   - Let's assume `R()` returns a list of three elements, say `[l, r, p]`.

3. **Condition `a[r] < l`**:
   - We need to check if the element at index `r` in the list `a` is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`.

4. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the tuple or list.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, it will print `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, it will print `(a[r], r)`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions:

- If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the output will be `[-1, -1]`.
- If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the output will be `(a[r], r)`.

Given the initial state and the structure of the problem, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] >= l, otherwise [-1, -1]** (where `a[r]` is the element at index `r` in the list `a` and `l` is the first element from `R()`)
