The code snippet `a += j` appends the value of `j` to the list `a`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `a` initially is `[0, 0, j]`.
- `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 1 if `x` was not equal to `p` before, or 0 if `x` was equal to `p` before.

After executing `a += j`:
- If `j` is 2, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 2, 2]`.
- If `j` is 1, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 2, 1]`.
- If `j` is 0, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 2, 0]`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `p`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, 2, j]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 1 if `x` was not equal to `p` before, or 0 if `x` was equal to `p` before, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is equal to the previous `x`, `x` is the next element from `R()`**.
