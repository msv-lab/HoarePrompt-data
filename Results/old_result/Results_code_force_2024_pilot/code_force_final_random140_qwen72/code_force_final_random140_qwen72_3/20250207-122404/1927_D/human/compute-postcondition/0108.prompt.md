Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    R()
    a = [0]
    p = i = j = 0
    for x in R():
        j = (j, i)[x != p]
        a += j,
        p = x
        i += 1
    q, = R()
    while q:
        q -= 1
        l, r = R()
        print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing integers starting with 0 followed by the sequence of `j` values determined by the loop, `q` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), `p` is the last element from `R()`, `i` is the length of `R()`, `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `q` is now 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `l` is the last element from `R()` before the loop ends, `r` is the second-to-last element from `R()` before the loop ends, `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
