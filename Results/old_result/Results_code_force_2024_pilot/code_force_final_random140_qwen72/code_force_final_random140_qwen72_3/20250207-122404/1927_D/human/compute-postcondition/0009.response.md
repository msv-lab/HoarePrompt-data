The code snippet `a += j,` appends the value of `j` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a` starts as `[0]` and `j` is `0`. After executing the code, `a` becomes `[0, 0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing integers [0, 0], `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `R()` returns an iterable with at least one element.**
