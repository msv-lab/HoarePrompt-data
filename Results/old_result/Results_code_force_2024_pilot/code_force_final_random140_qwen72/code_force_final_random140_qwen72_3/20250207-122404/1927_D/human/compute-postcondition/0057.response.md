Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, 2, j]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 1 if `x` was not equal to `p` before, or 0 if `x` was equal to `p` before, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is now equal to the current `x`, `x` is the next element from `R()`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
