Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is [0, 0, 0, j], `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `p` is the next element from `R()` after the second one, `i` is 2, `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `R()` returns an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the next element from `R()` after the third one.**

Explanation:
- `p` is assigned the value of `x`.
- `x` is the next element from `R()` after the second one, so now `x` is the next element from `R()` after the third one.
- The value of `j` depends on whether `x` (which was the second element from `R()`) is equal to `p` (which is now the third element from `R()`). If they are not equal, `j` remains 2; otherwise, `j` is 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `i`, and the properties of `R()`) remain unchanged.
