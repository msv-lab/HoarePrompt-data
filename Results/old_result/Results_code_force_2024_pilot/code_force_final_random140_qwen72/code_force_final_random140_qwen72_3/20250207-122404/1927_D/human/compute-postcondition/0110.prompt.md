You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        R()
        
        a = [0]
        
        p = i = j = 0
        
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += j,
            p = x
            i += 1
        
        q, = R()
        
        while q:
            q -= 1
            l, r = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `l` is the last element from `R()` before the loop ends, `r` is the second-to-last element from `R()` before the loop ends, `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements in an array, the array itself, the number of queries, and the queries. It processes each query on the array and returns the results of the queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
