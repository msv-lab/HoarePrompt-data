Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing only the integer 0, `q` is 0, `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- `p`, `i`, and `j` are all set to 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
