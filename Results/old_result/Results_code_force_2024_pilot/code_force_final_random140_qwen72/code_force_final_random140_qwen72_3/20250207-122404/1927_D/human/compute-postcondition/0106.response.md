To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3.
2. `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
3. `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`.
4. `i` is `n`.
5. `j` is 0.
6. `l` is the first element from `R()`.
7. `r` is the second element from `R()`.
8. `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`.
9. `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 2 and must still be non-zero.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `R()`**:
   - `R()` is a function that returns an iterable. Let's assume it returns a list of integers for simplicity.
   - `l` is the first element of this iterable.
   - `r` is the second element of this iterable.
   - `p` is the last element of this iterable.

2. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by indices where `x` was different from `p`.
   - For example, if `n = 5` and `x` was different from `p` at indices 1 and 3, then `a` might look like `[0, 1, 3]`.

3. **Condition `a[r] < l`**:
   - We need to check if the element at index `r` in `a` is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r] >= l`, the expression will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`.

4. **Unpacking the Tuple**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the tuple or list.
   - If the condition is true, it will print `-1, -1`.
   - If the condition is false, it will print `a[r], r`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will depend on the values of `a[r]` and `l`. Since the exact values of `a` and `R()` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] >= l, otherwise -1, -1 (where a[r] is the element at index r in the list a, and l is the first element from R())**
