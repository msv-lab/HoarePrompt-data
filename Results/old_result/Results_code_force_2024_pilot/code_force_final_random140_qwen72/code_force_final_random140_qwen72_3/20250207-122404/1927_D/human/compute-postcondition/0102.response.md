To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is 0.
- `l` is the first element from `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from `R()`.
- `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1 and must still be non-zero.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a[r]` and `l`:**
   - `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by indices where `x` was different from `p`.
   - `r` is the second element from `R()`, which is an index into the list `a`.
   - `l` is the first element from `R()`, which is a value used for comparison.

2. **Condition `a[r] < l`:**
   - This condition checks if the value at index `r` in the list `a` is less than the value `l`.

3. **Ternary Operation:**
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` is a ternary operation.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, it will return `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, it will return `(a[r], r)`.

4. **Unpacking the Tuple:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the tuple or list.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, it will print `-1 -1`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, it will print `a[r] r`.

### Final Output:
- If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the output will be `-1 -1`.
- If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the output will be `a[r] r`.

Since the exact values of `a[r]` and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `-1 -1` or `a[r] r`.

Output: **-1 -1 (if a[r] < l is True) or a[r] r (if a[r] < l is False)**
