The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an array and a series of queries on that array. The function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the length of the array, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5.
  - Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r`, where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and each query within the test case, and returns the results of the queries. The specific nature of the queries (e.g., what they compute) is not specified in the given information, but the function is expected to handle these queries and produce the appropriate output for each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements in an array, the array itself, the number of queries, and the queries. It processes each query on the array and returns the results of the queries.**
