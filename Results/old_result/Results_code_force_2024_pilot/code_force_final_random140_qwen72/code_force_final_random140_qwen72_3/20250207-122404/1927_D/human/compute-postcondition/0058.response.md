Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `q` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Initially contains `[0]`. After each iteration, the value of `j` is appended to `a`. Since `j` alternates between 0 and the current index `i`, the list `a` will contain `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` after `n` iterations.
- **`q`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. After `n` iterations, `i` will be `n`.
- **`j`**: Alternates between 0 and the current index `i`. After `n` iterations, `j` will be `n-1`.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: After the loop completes, `p` will be the last element from `R()`.
