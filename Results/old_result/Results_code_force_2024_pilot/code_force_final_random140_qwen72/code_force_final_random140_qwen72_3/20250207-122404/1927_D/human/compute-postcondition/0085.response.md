The code snippet `a += j` appends the value of `j` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a` starts as `[0, 0]`, and `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0. Therefore, the value of `j` will determine the new state of `a`.

- If `x` is not equal to `p`, `j` is 1, and `a` will become `[0, 0, 1]`.
- If `x` is equal to `p`, `j` is 0, and `a` will become `[0, 0, 0]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, 1]` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `a` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the first element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `x` is the second element of the iterable returned by `R()`**
