Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0 if `x == p` otherwise `j` is `i`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is 0, `x` is the first element of the iterable returned by `R()`**

Explanation:
- The code `j = (j, i)[x != p]` checks if `x` is not equal to `p`.
- If `x` is not equal to `p`, `j` is set to `i`.
- If `x` is equal to `p`, `j` remains `0`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `p`, `x`) remain unchanged.
