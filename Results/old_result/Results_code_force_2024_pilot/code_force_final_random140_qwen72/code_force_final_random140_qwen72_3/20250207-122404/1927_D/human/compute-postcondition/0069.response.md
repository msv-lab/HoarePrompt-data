Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `q` is now `q - 3` and must be at least 2, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `q` is `q - 3`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `j`, `l`, `r`, `p`) remain unchanged.
