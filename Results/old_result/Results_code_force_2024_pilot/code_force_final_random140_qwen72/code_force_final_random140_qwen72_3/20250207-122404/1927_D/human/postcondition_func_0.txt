The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array and a set of queries. For each test case, it reads the array and constructs a new list `a` that tracks the positions where the elements change. For each query, it prints the result based on the constructed list `a` and the query parameters. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all input has been read and processed, and the state variables related to the current test case are reset or exhausted.
