Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `q` is now `q - 2` and must be non-zero, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- The line `l, r = R()` updates the values of `l` and `r` to the first and second elements returned by the function `R()`, respectively.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `i`, `j`, `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
