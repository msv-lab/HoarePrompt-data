The function call `R()` is executed, but there is no definition or description of what the function `R()` does. Without knowing the implementation of `R()`, it's impossible to determine its exact effect on the program state. However, since no changes to the variables are specified, we assume that the function `R()` does not alter the state of the program.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, and the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
