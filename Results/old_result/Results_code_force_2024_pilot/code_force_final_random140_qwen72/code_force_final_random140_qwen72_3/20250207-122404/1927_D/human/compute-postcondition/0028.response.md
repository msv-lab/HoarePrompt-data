To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list containing integers starting with 0 followed by the sequence of `j` values determined by the loop.
- `q` is the first element from `R()` minus 1 and must be non-zero.
- `p` is the last element from `R()`.
- `i` is the length of `R()`.
- `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1.
- `R()` returns an iterable with exactly `i` elements.
- `l` is the first element from `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from `R()`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

1. **Determine `a[r]` and `r`:**
   - `r` is the second element from `R()`.
   - `a[r]` is the element in the list `a` at the index `r`.

2. **Determine `l`:**
   - `l` is the first element from `R()`.

3. **Evaluate the Condition `a[r] < l`:**
   - If `a[r]` is less than `l`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r]` is greater than or equal to `l`, the expression will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`.

4. **Unpack the Result:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the tuple or list.
   - If the result is `[-1, -1]`, it will print `-1 -1`.
   - If the result is `(a[r], r)`, it will print `a[r] r`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic of the print statement, the output will depend on the values of `a[r]` and `l`. Since the exact values of `a`, `R()`, and the elements within them are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a[r] r (if a[r] >= l) or -1 -1 (if a[r] < l)**

This means:
- If `a[r]` is greater than or equal to `l`, the output will be the value of `a[r]` followed by the value of `r`.
- If `a[r]` is less than `l`, the output will be `-1 -1`.
