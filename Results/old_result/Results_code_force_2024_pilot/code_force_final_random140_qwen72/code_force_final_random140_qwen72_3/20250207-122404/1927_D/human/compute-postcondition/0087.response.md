The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, 1]` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `a` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is now equal to `x`, `x` is the second element of the iterable returned by `R()`**.
