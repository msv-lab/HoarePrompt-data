The value of `q` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing integers starting with 0 followed by the sequence of `j` values determined by the loop, `q` is the first element from `R()` minus 1 and must be non-zero, `p` is the last element from `R()`, `i` is the length of `R()`, `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1, `R()` returns an iterable with exactly `i` elements.**
