The value of `p` is updated to the value of `x`. Since the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `p` now holds whatever value `x` had before this assignment.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing integers [0, 0], `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `p` is equal to `x`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `R()` returns an iterable with at least one element.**
