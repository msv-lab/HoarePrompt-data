To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
- `q` is now `q - 2` and must be non-zero.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `l` is the first element from `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from `R()`.
- `p` is the last element from `R()`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` starts with two zeros and then contains the integers from 1 to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `a = [0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.

2. **Variables `l` and `r`**:
   - `l` is the first element from `R()`.
   - `r` is the second element from `R()`.
   - `R()` is a function that returns a sequence of elements, but the exact nature of `R()` is not specified. For the purpose of this analysis, we assume `R()` returns valid indices for the list `a`.

3. **Condition `a[r] < l`**:
   - This condition checks if the element at index `r` in the list `a` is less than the value of `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the tuple `(a[r], r)` will be selected.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the list `[-1, -1]` will be selected.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the selected tuple or list.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, it will print `a[r]` and `r`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, it will print `-1` and `-1`.

### Possible Outcomes:
- **If `a[r] < l` is `True`**:
  - The output will be the value of `a[r]` and the index `r`.
- **If `a[r] < l` is `False`**:
  - The output will be `-1` and `-1`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the value of `a[r]` and `r` or `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise (-1, -1)**

This means:
- If `a[r]` is less than `l`, the output will be the value of `a[r]` and the index `r`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1` and `-1`.
