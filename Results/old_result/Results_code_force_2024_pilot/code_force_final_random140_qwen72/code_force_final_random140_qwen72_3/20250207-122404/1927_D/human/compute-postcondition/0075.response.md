Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `q` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- The function `R()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `R()` is provided, we assume it returns a sequence of elements.
- The variables `l`, `r`, and `p` are assigned the first, second, and last elements from the sequence returned by `R()`, respectively.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated values of `l`, `r`, and `p` while keeping the other variables in their initial state.
