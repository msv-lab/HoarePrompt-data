### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `R` is defined to read a line of input and split it into integers.
   - The variable `t` is set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` is read but not used directly.
   - The array `a` is initialized with a dummy value `0` to handle 1-based indexing.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the array `a` as read from input.
   - The variable `j` is updated to the current index `i` if the current element `x` is different from the previous element `p`.
   - The array `a` is extended with the value of `j` at each step.
   - The variable `p` is updated to the current element `x`.
   - The index `i` is incremented.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - The number of queries `q` is read.
   - For each query, the range `[l, r]` is read.
   - The function checks if `a[r]` (which stores the last index where a different element was found) is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, it means there are no different elements in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `-1 -1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The logic correctly identifies the last index `j` where a different element was found up to the current index `i`.
  - For each query, it checks if this last index `a[r]` is within the range `[l, r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is within the range, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`, which ensures that `a[a[r]] != a[r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is not within the range, it prints `-1 -1`, indicating no different elements exist in the range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same by printing `-1 -1`.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the range `[l, r]` is a single element by printing `-1 -1`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program efficiently processes the input and queries by using a single pass to construct the array `a` and another pass to process the queries.
  - The time complexity is \(O(n + q)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output format correctly and implements the logic to find pairs of different elements within the specified ranges.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
