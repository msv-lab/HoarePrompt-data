Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations as specified by the initial input value `_`. For each iteration, the values of `n` and `m` were read from the input, and the conditions within the loop were evaluated. If `n` was less than `m`, "NO" was printed. If `n` was greater than or equal to `m` and both `n` and `m` were either both odd or both even, "YES" was printed. The loop has now finished executing, and no further iterations will occur.**

This means that the loop has processed all the test cases as specified by the initial input value. Each test case involved reading two integers `n` and `m`, and based on the conditions provided, the appropriate output ("YES" or "NO") was printed for each test case. The loop has now completed its execution, and the program will proceed to any code that follows the loop, if any.
