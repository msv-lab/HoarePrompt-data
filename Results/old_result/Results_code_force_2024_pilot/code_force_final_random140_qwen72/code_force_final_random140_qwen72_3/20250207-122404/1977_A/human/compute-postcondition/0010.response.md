Output State: **`_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100), `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input, and if `n` is less than `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true, and if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the condition is satisfied.**
