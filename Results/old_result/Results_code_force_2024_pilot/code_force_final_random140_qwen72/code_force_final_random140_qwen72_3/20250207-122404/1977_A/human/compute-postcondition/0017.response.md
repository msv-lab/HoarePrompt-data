Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100).
- `n` and `m` are updated to the new integers read from the input.
- If the new `n` is less than the new `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true.
- If the new `n` is greater than or equal to the new `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true.
- If the new `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the condition is satisfied.
- The loop has executed one more time, so the remaining iterations are reduced by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and updates for variables `n` and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is independent of the conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m` or any other conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
