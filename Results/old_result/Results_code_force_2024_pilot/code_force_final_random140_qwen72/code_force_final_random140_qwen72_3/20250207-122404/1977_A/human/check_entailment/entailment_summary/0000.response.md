Reasoning:  
The program correctly addresses the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **If `n < m`**: This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the required number of cubes. If this is true, it's impossible to build a tower of height `m` with fewer than `m` moves, so the program prints "NO".
   - **If `n >= m`**: The program then checks if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. This is because:
     - If `n` and `m` are both odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
     - If `n` and `m` are both even, it's also possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
     - If one is odd and the other is even, it's not possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the above conditions, which aligns with the expected output format.

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. The program handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
