The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is derived from the input and must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100). The loop iterates based on this value. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is derived from the input, and the conditions involving `n` and `m` (whether `n < m` or `n >= m`, and whether they are both odd or both even) are satisfied.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` must be decremented by 1, but since `_` is re-initialized in each iteration from the input, it does not change. Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered is the input value itself, which remains constant across iterations.

However, since the loop is controlled by the range function, which depends on the input value, the loop will continue to execute as long as the input value is greater than 0. After each iteration, the loop counter (which is not explicitly named but is managed internally by the `range` function) is incremented by 1.

Given that the input value is fixed and does not change, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop counter is incremented by 1, but since we do not have direct access to this counter, we focus on the input value and the conditions involving `n` and `m`.

State: **`_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100), and `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input. If `n` is less than `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true, and if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the condition is satisfied.**
