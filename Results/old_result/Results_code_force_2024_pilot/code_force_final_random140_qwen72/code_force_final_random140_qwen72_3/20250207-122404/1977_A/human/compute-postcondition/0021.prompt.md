Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n < m:
        print('NO')
    elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100), and `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input. If `n` is less than `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true, and if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the condition is satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100), and `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input. If `n` is less than `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true. Additionally, if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the condition is satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100). `n` and `m` are updated to the new integers read from the input. If the new `n` is less than the new `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true. If the new `n` is greater than or equal to the new `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true. If the new `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the loop has executed one more time, so the remaining iterations are reduced by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
