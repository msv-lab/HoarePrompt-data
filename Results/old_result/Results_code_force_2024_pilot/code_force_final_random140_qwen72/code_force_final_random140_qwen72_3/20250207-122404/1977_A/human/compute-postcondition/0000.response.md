The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is derived from the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value passed to `range()` must be greater than 0. This means the input must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.

However, the state of `t`, `n`, and `m` does not directly affect the loop's execution since the loop's execution is determined by the input value. The loop will execute if the input value is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100)**
