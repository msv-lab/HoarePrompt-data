Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the provided program. The condition `elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):` is indeed insufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The core issue is that the program should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which ensures that the parity of the number of moves matches the parity of the final number of cubes.

To illustrate why the original program is incorrect, consider the test case `n = 4` and `m = 2`:
- According to the problem, it is possible to achieve this by performing the following moves:
  - Add a cube (1 cube)
  - Add a cube (2 cubes)
  - Remove a cube (1 cube)
  - Add a cube (2 cubes)
- However, the given program would incorrectly output "No" for this case because it does not correctly handle the parity check.

A correct condition would be:
```python
if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This condition checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is the correct way to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given this reasoning, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
