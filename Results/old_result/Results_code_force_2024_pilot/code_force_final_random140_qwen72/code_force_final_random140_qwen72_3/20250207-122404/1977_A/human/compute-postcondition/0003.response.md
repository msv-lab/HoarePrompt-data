Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input.
- The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions; it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
