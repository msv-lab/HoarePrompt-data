The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it seems to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves two integers, `n` and `m`, where both are within the range of 1 to 100. The function likely processes these test cases and returns some result based on the values of `n` and `m`.

However, since the specific output or behavior of the function is not detailed, I will describe the parameters and the general expected functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 100). It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
