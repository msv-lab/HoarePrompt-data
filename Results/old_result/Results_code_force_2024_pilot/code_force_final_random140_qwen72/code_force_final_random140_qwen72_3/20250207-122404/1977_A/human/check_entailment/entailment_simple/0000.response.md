Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition checks if `n` is less than `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have a tower of height `m` after `n` moves, so the program correctly prints "NO".
   - The second condition checks if `n` and `m` are both odd or both even. This is because:
     - If `n` and `m` are both odd, it means the number of moves and the final height are both odd, which is possible.
     - If `n` and `m` are both even, it means the number of moves and the final height are both even, which is also possible.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, the program implicitly prints "NO" (though it could be more explicit).

3. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions, which aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `m` are at their minimum values (1) and maximum values (100) correctly.
   - It also handles cases where `n` is equal to `m` correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
