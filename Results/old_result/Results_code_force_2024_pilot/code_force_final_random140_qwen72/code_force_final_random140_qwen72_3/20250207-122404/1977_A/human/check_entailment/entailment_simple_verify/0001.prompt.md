You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations as specified by the initial input value `_`. For each iteration, the values of `n` and `m` were read from the input, and the conditions within the loop were evaluated. If `n` was less than `m`, "NO" was printed. If `n` was greater than or equal to `m` and both `n` and `m` were either both odd or both even, "YES" was printed. The loop has now finished executing, and no further iterations will occur.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if `n` is less than `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves, so it prints "NO".

3. **Parity Check**: If `n` is not less than `m`, the function then checks the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m`:
   - If both `n` and `m` are odd, or both are even, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it implicitly prints "NO" (since there is no explicit print statement for this case).

### Explanation of Parity Check:
- **Odd `n` and Odd `m`**: If both `n` and `m` are odd, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because you can always add or remove an odd number of cubes to reach another odd number.
- **Even `n` and Even `m`**: Similarly, if both `n` and `m` are even, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because you can always add or remove an even number of cubes to reach another even number.
- **Mixed Parity**: If one of `n` or `m` is odd and the other is even, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because adding or removing an even number of cubes will not change the parity of the number of cubes, and adding or removing an odd number of cubes will change the parity.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n` and `m` are both odd.
  - Output: "YES"
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n` is even, and `m` is even.
  - Output: "NO" (because `n` is less than `m`)
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n` and `m` are both odd.
  - Output: "YES"

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
