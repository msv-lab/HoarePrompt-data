The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). It then evaluates the following conditions for each test case: if `n` is less than `m`, it prints "NO". If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even, it prints "YES". After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and no further output is produced.
