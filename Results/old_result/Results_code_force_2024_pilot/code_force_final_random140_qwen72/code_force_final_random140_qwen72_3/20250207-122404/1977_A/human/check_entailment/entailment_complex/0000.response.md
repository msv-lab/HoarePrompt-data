Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterating over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The condition `if n < m:` correctly checks if it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The condition `elif n & 1 and m & 1 or n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0:` checks if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even. This is correct because:
     - If `n` is odd and `m` is odd, it means the number of moves and the final number of cubes are both odd, which is possible.
     - If `n` is even and `m` is even, it means the number of moves and the final number of cubes are both even, which is also possible.
     - If `n` is odd and `m` is even, or vice versa, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves because the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves and the final number of cubes must match.

3. **Output**: The function prints "NO" if the first condition is met, and "YES" if the second condition is met. This aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
