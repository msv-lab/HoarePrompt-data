Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input.
- The conditions are:
  - If `n` is less than `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true.
  - If `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the condition is satisfied.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute because the conditions ensure that the program reaches this point. The conditions provided are designed to cover all possible cases for `n` and `m` being integers derived from the input.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
