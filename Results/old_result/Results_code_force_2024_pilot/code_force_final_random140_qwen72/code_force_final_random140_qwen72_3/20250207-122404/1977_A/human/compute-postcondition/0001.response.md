The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `m`.

Given the initial state: `_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100).

After executing the code, the variables `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, and the variable `_` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100), `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input.**
