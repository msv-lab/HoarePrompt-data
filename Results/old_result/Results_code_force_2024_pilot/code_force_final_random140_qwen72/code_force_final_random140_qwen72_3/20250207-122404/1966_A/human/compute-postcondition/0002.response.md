Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input.** 

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
