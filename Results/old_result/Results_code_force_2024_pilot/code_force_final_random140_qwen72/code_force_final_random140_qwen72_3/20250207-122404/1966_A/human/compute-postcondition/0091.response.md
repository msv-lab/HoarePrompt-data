The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters related to the described constraints. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by `n` and `k`, and a list `c` of integers.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `c` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function performs operations based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `c`, and returns a result specific to each test case.**
