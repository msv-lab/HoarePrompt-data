Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary with `i` as a key, and `ans` is equal to `n`. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`. If `h[i]` is less than `k`, there is no change to `ams`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary with the second element of `a` as a key. If `i` is in `h`, the value associated with `i` in `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `h` is set to 1. `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is set to `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary with the third element of `a` as a key. If `i` is in `h`, the value associated with `i` in `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `h` is set to 1. `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
