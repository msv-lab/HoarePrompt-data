Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 but now decreased by 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each element in `arrC`, and `ans` is either `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains `n`.**
