You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, representing the number of cards and the number of cards exchanged in each operation, respectively. c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers written on the cards.

    #State: _ is t-1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the final input, `k` is the second integer from the final input, `a` is a list of integers from the final input, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`. If any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times, `ams` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` remains undefined, and `ans` is equal to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `a`.

2. **Frequency Counting**: The program uses a dictionary `h` to count the frequency of each card number in the list `a`. This is done correctly using a loop that increments the count for each card number.

3. **Operation Logic**: The program attempts to reduce the number of cards by checking if the frequency of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`. However, the logic for reducing the number of cards is incomplete and incorrect. Specifically, the variable `ams` is set to `k - 1` but is not used to update the total number of cards `ans`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is initially set to `n` (the total number of cards). Since the reduction logic is not implemented correctly, the program does not actually compute the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

Given the issues in the operation logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
