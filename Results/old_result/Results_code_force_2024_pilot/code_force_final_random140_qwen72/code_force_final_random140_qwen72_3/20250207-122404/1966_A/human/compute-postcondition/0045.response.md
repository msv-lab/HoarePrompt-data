Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input and must contain at least two elements, `h` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the second element of `a`) is mapped to 1, `ans` is equal to `n` if `h[i]` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is set to `k - 1`.**
