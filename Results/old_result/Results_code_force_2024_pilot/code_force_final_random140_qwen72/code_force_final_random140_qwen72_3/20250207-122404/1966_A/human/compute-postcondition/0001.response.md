The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, converting both to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `input()` returns `t`

Since `input()` returns `t`, and `t` is a single integer, the input must be split into two parts. However, since `t` is a single integer, the split operation will fail unless `t` is provided as a string containing two integers separated by a space. For the purpose of this simulation, let's assume `t` is provided as a string of two integers separated by a space, e.g., "10 20".

Thus, the input is split into two parts:
- The first part is assigned to `n`
- The second part is assigned to `k`

Both `n` and `k` are converted to integers.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `_` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
