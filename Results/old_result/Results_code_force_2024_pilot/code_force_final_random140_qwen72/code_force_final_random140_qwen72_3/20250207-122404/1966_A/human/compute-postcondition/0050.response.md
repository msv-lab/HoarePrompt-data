Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input and must contain at least two elements, `h` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the next element of `a` after the second) is mapped to `h[i] + 1`, and `ans` remains `n` unless `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` after the update, in which case `ans` is set to `k - 1`.**
