Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `h` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `ams` is undefined, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`. However, the code snippet resets `h` to an empty dictionary `{}`.
- The variables `_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The variable `ams` remains undefined as no conditions are checked to set it.
- The variable `ans` remains equal to `n` as no changes are made to it.
