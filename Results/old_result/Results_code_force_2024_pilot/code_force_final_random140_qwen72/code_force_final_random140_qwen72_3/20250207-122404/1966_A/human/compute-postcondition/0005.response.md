The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. The value of `i` will be set to the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` has at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `a`.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`**
