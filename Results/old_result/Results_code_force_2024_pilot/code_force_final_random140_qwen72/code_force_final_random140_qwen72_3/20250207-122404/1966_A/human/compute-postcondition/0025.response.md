Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary with the third element of `a` as a key. If `i` is in `h`, the value associated with `i` in `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `h` is set to 1. `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. `ams` is set to `k - 1`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `ams` is set to `k - 1`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `h`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
