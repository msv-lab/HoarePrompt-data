Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.
- `ams` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ams` remains undefined.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Variable `ans`**: According to the initial state, `ans` is explicitly set to the value of `n`.
2. **Value of `n`**: `n` is the first integer from the input.

Since `ans` is directly assigned the value of `n`, the `print` statement will output the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the input)**
