The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This updates the values of `n` and `k` from their initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 1
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`
- `ans` is equal to `n`
- `ams` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ams` remains undefined

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is updated to the first integer from the new input
- `k` is updated to the second integer from the new input

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `ans` is equal to the first integer from the new input, `ams` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ams` remains undefined.**
