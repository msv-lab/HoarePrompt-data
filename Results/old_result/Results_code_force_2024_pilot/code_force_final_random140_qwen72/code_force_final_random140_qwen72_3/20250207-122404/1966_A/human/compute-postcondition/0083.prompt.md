Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `h` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `ams` is undefined, `ans` is equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is the first integer from the new input, k is the second integer from the new input, a is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least one element, i is the first element of a, ans is equal to n, h is a dictionary where i is a key with a value incremented by 1. If h[i] is greater than or equal to k, ams is set to k - 1. Otherwise, ams remains undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where `i` (the second element of `a`) is a key. If `i` is in `h`, the value of `h[i]` is incremented by 2. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` remains undefined. If `i` is not in `h`, the value of `h[i]` is set to 1, and `ams` remains undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is the first integer from the new input, k is the second integer from the new input, a is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least three elements, i is the third element of a, ans is equal to n, h is a dictionary where the second element of a is a key. If i is in h, h[i] is incremented by 1. If the second element of a is in h, the value of h[second element of a] is incremented by 2. If h[second element of a] is greater than or equal to k, ams is set to k - 1. Otherwise, ams remains undefined. If the second element of a is not in h, the value of h[second element of a] is set to 1, and ams remains undefined. If i is not in h, h[i] is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
