Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary with `i` as a key, and `ans` is equal to `n`. The value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
