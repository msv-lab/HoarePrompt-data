The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given context, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to the number of test cases (`t`), the number of cards (`n`), the number of cards exchanged in each operation (`k`), and a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards (`c`). The function's output is not clearly specified, but it is expected to process these inputs in some way, likely returning a result for each test case.

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, representing the number of cards and the number of cards exchanged in each operation, respectively.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers written on the cards.

The function is expected to return a result for each test case, which could be a modified list of card numbers or some other derived value based on the operations performed.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves `n` cards and `k` cards exchanged in each operation. The function returns a result for each test case, which could be a modified list of card numbers or a derived value based on the operations performed.**
