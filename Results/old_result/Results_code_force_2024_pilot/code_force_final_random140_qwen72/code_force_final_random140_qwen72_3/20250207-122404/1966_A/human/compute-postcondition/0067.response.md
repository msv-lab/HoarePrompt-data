Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is the first integer from the new input, k is the second integer from the new input, a is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least one element, i is the first element of a, ans is equal to n, ams is undefined, and h is a dictionary. If i is already a key in h, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, i is added as a key to h with a value of 1.**
