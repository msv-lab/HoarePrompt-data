To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the `print(ans)` statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100.
   - `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100.
   - `arrC` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each element in `arrC`.
   - `ans` is either `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains `n`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The `hashmap` dictionary is constructed to count the frequency of each element in `arrC`.
   - If any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, `ans` is set to `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains `n`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on the frequency counts in `hashmap`.
   - If any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, `ans` will be `k - 1`.
   - If no element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, `ans` will be `n`.

Given this, the output will be one of two possible values:
- **`k - 1`** if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times.
- **`n`** if no element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **ans (where ans is k - 1 if any element in arrC appears k or more times, otherwise ans is n)**
