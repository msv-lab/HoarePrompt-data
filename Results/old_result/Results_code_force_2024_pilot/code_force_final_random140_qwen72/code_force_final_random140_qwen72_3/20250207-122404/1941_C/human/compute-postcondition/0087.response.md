Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a string.
- `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2 or more, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
- `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a` that were found during the loop's execution.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` holds the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.
- Since the loop has completed its iterations (`i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2 or more), `ans` contains the final count of these substrings.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
