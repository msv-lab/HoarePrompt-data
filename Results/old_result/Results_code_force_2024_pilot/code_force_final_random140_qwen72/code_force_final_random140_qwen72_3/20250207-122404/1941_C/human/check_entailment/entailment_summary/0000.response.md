Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the program has a logical flaw in how it counts the deletions needed to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program increments `i` by 3 whenever it finds a "map" or "pie" substring, which means it skips over the next two characters without checking them. This can lead to incorrect results if there are overlapping substrings that need to be removed.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would find "map" at the start and skip the next two characters, missing the "pie" that follows immediately after. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings.

Additionally, the program only prints the result for each test case instead of returning it, which is not a functional issue but a deviation from typical expectations for such problems.

Correctness: **False**
