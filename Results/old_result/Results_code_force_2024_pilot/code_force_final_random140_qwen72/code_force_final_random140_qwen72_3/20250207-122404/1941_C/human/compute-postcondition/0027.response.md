Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t` with `len(a) = 5`, `s` is the substring of `a` from the third character to the fifth character. If `s` is 'map' or 's' is 'pie', `i` is 5 and `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is 3.***
