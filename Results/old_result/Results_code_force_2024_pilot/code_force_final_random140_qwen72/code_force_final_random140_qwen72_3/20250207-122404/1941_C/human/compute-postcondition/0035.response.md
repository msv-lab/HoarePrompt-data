The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` extracts a substring from the string `a` starting at index `i` (which is 0) and ending at index `i + 3` (exclusive). Since `i` is 0, the substring `s` will contain the first three characters of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2
- `i` is 0
- `ans` is 0

After executing the code:
- `s` is assigned the value of the first three characters of `a`
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `s` is the first three characters of `a`.**
