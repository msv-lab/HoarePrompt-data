The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 4. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0, `i` is 4.**
