The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t` with `len(a) = 5`, `s` is the substring of `a` from the third character to the fifth character, `i` is 5, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
