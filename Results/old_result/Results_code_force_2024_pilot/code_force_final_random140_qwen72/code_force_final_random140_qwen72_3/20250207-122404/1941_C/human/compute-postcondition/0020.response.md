Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`, and `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.***
