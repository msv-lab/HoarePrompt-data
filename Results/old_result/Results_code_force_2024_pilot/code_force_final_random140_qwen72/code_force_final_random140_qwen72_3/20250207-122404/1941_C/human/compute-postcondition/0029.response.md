Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the string representation of `t`.
- `i` is equal to the length of `a` (since the loop exits when `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`).
- `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in `a` during the loop's execution.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `t`**: `t` is an integer within the range \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can be any integer from 100 to 10,000.
2. **String Representation `a`**: `a` is the string representation of `t`. For example, if `t` is 1234, then `a` would be "1234".
3. **Length of `a`**: The length of `a` is the number of characters in the string representation of `t`. For example, if `t` is 1234, then `len(a)` is 4.
4. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the string `a` and checks for the substrings 'map' or 'pie'. Since `t` is an integer between 100 and 10,000, the string `a` will only contain digits (0-9). Therefore, it is impossible for the substrings 'map' or 'pie' to appear in `a`.
5. **Count of Substrings**: Since 'map' and 'pie' do not appear in `a`, the count of these substrings (`ans`) will be 0.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
