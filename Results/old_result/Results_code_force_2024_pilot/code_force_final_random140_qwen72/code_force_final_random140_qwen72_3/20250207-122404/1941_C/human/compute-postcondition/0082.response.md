The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Since `i` was either 4 or 2, after the increment, `i` will be either 7 or 5, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the same string and `len(a)` must be greater than 6, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` is now either 7 or 5, and `ans` is either 2, 1, or 0.**
