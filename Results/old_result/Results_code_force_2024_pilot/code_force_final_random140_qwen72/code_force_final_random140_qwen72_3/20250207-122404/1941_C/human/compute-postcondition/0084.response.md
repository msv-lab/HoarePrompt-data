Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the same string and `len(a)` must be greater than 6, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` (if `i` is 5, `s` is `a[5:8]`; if `i` is 3, `s` is `a[3:6]`), `i` is now either 5 or 3, and `ans` is either 2, 1, or 0.**
