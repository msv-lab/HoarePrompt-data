Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Since `t` is an integer between 100 and 10,000, the string `a` will have at least 3 characters and at most 5 characters.
   - The variable `s` is assigned the first 3 characters of the string `a`.

4. **Determine the Value of `s`:**
   - If `t` is 100, then `a` is "100" and `s` is "100".
   - If `t` is 1234, then `a` is "1234" and `s` is "123".
   - If `t` is 9999, then `a` is "9999" and `s` is "999".

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `s` will always be the first 3 characters of the string representation of `t`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(s)` statement will be the first 3 characters of the string representation of `t`.

Output: **s (where s is the first 3 characters of the string representation of t)**
