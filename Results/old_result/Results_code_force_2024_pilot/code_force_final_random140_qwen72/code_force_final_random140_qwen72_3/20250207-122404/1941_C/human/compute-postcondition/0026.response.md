The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t` with `len(a) = 5`, `s` is the substring of `a` from the third character to the fifth character, and `i` is 3.**
