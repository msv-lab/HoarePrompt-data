Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3, `i` is either 1 or 3 depending on the initial conditions, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3 or greater than 3 if `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions.
- The condition `len(a) > 5` if `i` is 3 and `len(a) > 3` if `i` is 1 still holds true.
