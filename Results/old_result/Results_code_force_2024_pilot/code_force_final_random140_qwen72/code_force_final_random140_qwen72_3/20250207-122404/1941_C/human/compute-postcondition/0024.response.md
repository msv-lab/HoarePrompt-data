The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `i` was 2, so the new value of `i` is 5. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t` with `len(a) = 5`, `s` is the substring of `a` from the third character to the fifth character, and `i` is 5.**
