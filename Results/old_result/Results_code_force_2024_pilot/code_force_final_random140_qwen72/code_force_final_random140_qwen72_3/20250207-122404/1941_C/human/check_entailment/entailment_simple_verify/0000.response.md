Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed fails to handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" correctly. When the program finds a substring "map" or "pie", it increments the index `i` by 3, effectively skipping the next two characters without checking them. This can lead to missing additional occurrences of "map" or "pie" that overlap with the current one.

For example, in the string "mappie":
- The program finds "map" at index 0 and sets `i` to 3.
- It then finds "pie" at index 3 and sets `i` to 6.
- The program outputs 2, but the correct answer should be 3 because the string can be made beautiful by removing 3 characters (either "map" or "pie" and one additional character).

To correctly handle overlapping substrings, the program should increment `i` by 1 even after finding a "map" or "pie" to ensure that all possible substrings are checked.

Final: **False**
