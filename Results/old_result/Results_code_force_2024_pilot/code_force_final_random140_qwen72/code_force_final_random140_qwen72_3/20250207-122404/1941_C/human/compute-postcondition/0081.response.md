To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a string with a length greater than 6.
   - `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.
   - `i` is either 4 or 2.
   - `ans` is either 2, 1, or 0.

2. **Determine the Substring `s`:**
   - If `i` is 4, then `s` is `a[4:7]`.
   - If `i` is 2, then `s` is `a[2:5]`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we need to consider both cases:

- **Case 1: `i` is 4**
  - `s` will be the substring of `a` starting at index 4 and ending at index 6 (inclusive).
  - Therefore, `s` is `a[4:7]`.

- **Case 2: `i` is 2**
  - `s` will be the substring of `a` starting at index 2 and ending at index 4 (inclusive).
  - Therefore, `s` is `a[2:5]`.

Given that `i` can be either 4 or 2, the output of the `print(s)` statement will depend on the value of `i`. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the two cases.

Output: **s (where s is `a[4:7]` if `i` is 4, or `a[2:5]` if `i` is 2)**
