To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while i < len(a) - 2:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `i`: This is the loop counter, currently set to 0.
   - `a`: This is a string, and the length of this string is crucial for the loop condition.
   - `len(a)`: This is the length of the string `a`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `i < len(a) - 2`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `0 < len(a) - 2`.

3. **Simplifying the Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `len(a) > 2`.

### Conclusion:
- The length of the string `a` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Adjusted State:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `a` to ensure its length is greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `i` is 0, and `ans` is 0**.
