Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3, `i` is either 4 or 6, `ans` is now 1 or 2.** 

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was initially either 0 or 1, after the increment, `ans` is now either 1 or 2. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
