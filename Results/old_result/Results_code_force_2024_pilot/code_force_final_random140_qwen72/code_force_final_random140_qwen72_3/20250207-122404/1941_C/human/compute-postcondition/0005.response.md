Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the substring of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 0) and ending at index `i + 3` (exclusive). Since `i` is 0, `s` will contain the first 3 characters of the string `a`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
