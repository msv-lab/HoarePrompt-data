Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3. If `s` is 'map' or 's` is 'pie', `i` is either 4 or 6, and `ans` is now 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is either 2 or 4 depending on the initial conditions, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 4 or greater than 3 if `i` is 2.***
