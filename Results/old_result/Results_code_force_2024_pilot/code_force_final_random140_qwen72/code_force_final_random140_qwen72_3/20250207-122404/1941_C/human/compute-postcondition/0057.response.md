Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2 (or greater, if the last few characters do not form a valid 3-character substring), and `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: This variable also remains unchanged as it is the input string and is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `a` minus 2, or possibly greater if the last few characters do not form a valid 3-character substring. This is because the loop increments `i` by 3 when it finds 'map' or 'pie', and by 1 otherwise, until `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`.
- **`ans`**: This variable counts the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' are found in `a`. Each time one of these substrings is found, `ans` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after the loop completes, `ans` will contain the total count of these substrings in `a`.
