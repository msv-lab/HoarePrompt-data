Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of `t`, `i` is equal to the length of `a` (since the loop exits when `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`), and `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in `a` during the loop's execution.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `a` also remains unchanged as it is only used to extract substrings and is not modified.
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a` because the loop increments `i` until it is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`.
- The variable `ans` will contain the total number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' were found in `a` during the loop's execution. Each time one of these substrings is found, `ans` is incremented by 1.
