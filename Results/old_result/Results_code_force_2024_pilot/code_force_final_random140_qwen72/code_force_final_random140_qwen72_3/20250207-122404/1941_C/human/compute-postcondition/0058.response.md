To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer within the range \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so it doesn't affect the output.

2. **Variable `a`**: This is the string representation of the new input. The exact content of `a` is not specified, but it is a string.

3. **Variable `i`**: This is the length of `a` minus 2. If the last few characters do not form a valid 3-character substring, `i` can be greater than `len(a) - 2`.

4. **Variable `ans`**: This is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Since the exact content of `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
