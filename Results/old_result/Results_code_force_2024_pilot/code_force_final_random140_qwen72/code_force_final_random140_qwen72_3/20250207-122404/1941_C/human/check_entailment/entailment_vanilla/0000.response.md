### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to make a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.
   - A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - We need to count the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to ensure the string does not contain these substrings.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `a`.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of characters to be removed.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the string `a` with an index `i`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks the substring of length 3 starting at index `i`.
   - If the substring is either "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 3 and increments `ans` by 1.
   - If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The logic for incrementing `i` by 3 when a substring "map" or "pie" is found is incorrect. This approach assumes that removing one character from the substring will make the string beautiful, but it may not always be the case.
   - For example, if the string is "mmapnapie", the code will remove one character from "map" and one character from "pie", resulting in "mnapie". However, "pie" is still present in the string, so the string is still ugly.
   - The correct approach should be to remove all characters in the substring "map" or "pie" to ensure the string becomes beautiful.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Instead of incrementing `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1, we should increment `ans` by 3 (or the length of the substring) and skip the entire substring.
   - This ensures that the entire "map" or "pie" substring is removed, making the string beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the removal of the substrings "map" or "pie". It only removes one character from each occurrence, which may leave the string still containing the substrings.

Correctness: **False**
