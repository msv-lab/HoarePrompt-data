Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the same string, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` is now either 4 or 4, and `ans` is now either 2 or 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was initially either 1 or 0, it is now either 2 or 1, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
