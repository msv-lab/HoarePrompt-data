Output State: **`g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `i` must be at least 4, if `i = 4`, then `i - 1 = 3`, and `p = 4` will satisfy the condition `p <= i - 1`, `h` is updated to `h - (h + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is incremented by 1, so `p` is now 4.
- All other conditions and variable updates from the initial state remain unchanged.
