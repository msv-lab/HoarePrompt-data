The value of `n` is halved using integer division (`n //= 2`). The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + n + n\) or `n_back` depending on the value of `n`, and `n` is now updated, the value of `s` might change if `n` was initially 0. However, since `n` is not specified to be 0 in the initial state, we assume `n` is not 0, and thus `s` remains \((n + 1) // 2 + n + n\).

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `m` is 8, `n` is `n // 2`, `s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + n + n\) or `n_back` depending on the new value of `n`.**
