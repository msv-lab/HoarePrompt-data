The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `n` and `k` are now updated based on the input, and they must satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.**
