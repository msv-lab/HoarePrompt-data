To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while s < k and d > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `s < k`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4\).
   - `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\).
   - For the loop to execute again, `s` must still be less than `k`.

2. **Condition 2: `d > 0`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2} - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{4} \right\rfloor\).
   - For the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **For `s < k` to hold true:**
  - Since `s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4\) and `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), we need to ensure that \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4\) is still less than `k`.
  - This condition is already satisfied because `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\).

- **For `d > 0` to hold true:**
  - We need to ensure that \(\frac{n - 1}{2} - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{4} \right\rfloor\) is greater than 0.
  - This condition depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute again, `d` must remain positive.

### Conclusion:

Since the conditions `s < k` and `d > 0` are already satisfied based on the given state, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4\), `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `i` is 2, `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2} - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{4} \right\rfloor\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\)**
