Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `(d + 1) // 2`.
- Since `d` is `n`, the new value of `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`) remain unchanged.
