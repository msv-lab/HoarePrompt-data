Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `m` is 8, `n` is `n // 2`, `s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + n + n\) or `n_back` plus the new value of `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`.
- The value of `s` is updated by adding the new value of `n` to its current value, which was initially \((n + 1) // 2 + n + n\) or `n_back`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `m` remain unchanged.
