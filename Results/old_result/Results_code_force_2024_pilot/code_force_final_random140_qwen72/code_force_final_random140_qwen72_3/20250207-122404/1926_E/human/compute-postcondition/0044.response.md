Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), then `s` is 0, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `d` is 0 or a small positive integer, `h` is reduced to 0 or a very small positive integer, `p` is equal to `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\), `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\), `f` is equal to `k - g`, and `y` is equal to \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\). Otherwise, if `k` ≤ \((n + 1) // 2\), then `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).**
