Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `s` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` is `n`.
- `h` is `n`.
- `p` is 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

### Explanation:
- The expression `2 * k - 1` is evaluated based on the value of `k`.
- Since `k` is an integer and \(1 \leq k \leq n\), the expression `2 * k - 1` will be an odd number.
- The exact value of `2 * k - 1` depends on the specific value of `k`.

### Output:
Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n and k ≤ (n + 1) // 2)**

This means the output will be an odd number, specifically the result of the formula `2 * k - 1` for the given value of `k`.
