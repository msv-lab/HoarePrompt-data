To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
```
while s < k and d > 0:
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `s` (initially 0)
- `k` (an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9)
- `d` (initially `n`)

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. `s < k`: For the loop to execute, `s` must be less than `k`.
2. `d > 0`: For the loop to execute, `d` must be greater than 0.

### Initial State:
- `s` is 0
- `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `n`

### Analysis:
- Since `s` is 0 and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, `s < k` will always be true because `k` is at least 1 (since 1 ≤ k ≤ n).
- `d` is `n`, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `d > 0` will always be true.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, both conditions `s < k` and `d > 0` are already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`**
