To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
```python
while s < k and d > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `s`: This is 0.
   - `k`: This is an integer that is either greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) or less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).
   - `d`: This is equal to `n`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `s` is 0.
   - `d` is equal to `n`.
   - `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and it is updated based on the input.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - `s < k`: Since `s` is 0, this condition will always be true as long as `k` is greater than 0.
   - `d > 0`: Since `d` is equal to `n`, this condition will be true as long as `n` is greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`s`**: It is already 0, which satisfies `s < k` as long as `k` is greater than 0.
- **`d`**: It is equal to `n`, which satisfies `d > 0` as long as `n` is greater than 0.
- **`k`**: It must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Given the constraints, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5 · 10^4, so it is always greater than 0.

Since `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, and `k` is an integer within the given range, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is 0, `d` is now equal to `n`, `h` is now equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `f` is equal to `k - g`, and `y` is equal to \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**
