Output State: **After all iterations, `s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`s`**: The loop continues until `s` reaches `k`. Each iteration of the loop increases `s` by \((d + 1) // 2\). Since `d` is halved each time, the sum of these increments will eventually reach `k`.
- **`i`**: This variable counts the number of iterations. It starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- **`d`**: This variable is halved each iteration and is reduced by \((d + 1) // 2\) each time. When `d` becomes 0, the loop terminates.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `t`, `n`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body. The value of `y` depends on `i` and `k`, but it does not affect the loop's termination condition.
