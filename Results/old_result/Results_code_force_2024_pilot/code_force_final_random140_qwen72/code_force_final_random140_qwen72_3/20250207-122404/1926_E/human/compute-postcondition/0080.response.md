Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is 0.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` is now equal to `n`.
- `h` is now equal to `n`.
- `p` is 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).
- `f` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `k`. According to the initial state, `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\). Since `k` is provided by the input, it is a specific integer value that satisfies this condition.

The expression `2 * k - 1` will be evaluated using the value of `k` from the input. Therefore, the output will be the result of this expression.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the value of k provided by the input and k ≤ (n + 1) // 2)**
