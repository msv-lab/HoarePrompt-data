Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `d` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is 0 or `k - n`, `y` is 0 or \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\). `k` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + (d + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `s` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`.
