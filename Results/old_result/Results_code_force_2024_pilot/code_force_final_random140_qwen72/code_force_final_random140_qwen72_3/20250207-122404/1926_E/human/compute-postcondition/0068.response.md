The code snippet `g += (h + 1) // 2` updates the value of `g` by adding the result of `(h + 1) // 2` to its current value. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `s` is `k`
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
   - `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input
   - `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2
   - `d` is 0
   - `h` is \( n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \)
   - `p` is 2
   - `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\)
   - `f` is `k - g`
   - `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - `h` is \( n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \)
   - `g` is initially \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\)
   - The new value of `g` is \( g + \left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \)

4. **Output State:**
   - `s` is `k`
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
   - `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input
   - `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2
   - `d` is 0
   - `h` is \( n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \)
   - `p` is 2
   - `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\)
   - `f` is `k - g`
   - `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0

Output State: **`s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is \( n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \), `p` is 2, `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**
