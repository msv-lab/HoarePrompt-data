The code `h -= (h + 1) // 2` updates the value of `h` by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from its current value. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `h` is initially set to `n`.
- The expression `(h + 1) // 2` calculates the integer division of `h + 1` by 2.
- This result is then subtracted from `h`.

Let's calculate the new value of `h`:

1. **Initial Value of `h`:** `h` is `n`.
2. **Expression Calculation:** `(h + 1) // 2` is equivalent to `(n + 1) // 2`.
3. **Update `h`:** `h -= (n + 1) // 2`.

So, the new value of `h` is:
\[ h = n - (n + 1) // 2 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ h = n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \]

Where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which rounds down to the nearest integer.

Now, let's list the output state:

- `s` is `k`.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2.
- `d` is 0.
- `h` is now \( n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \).
- `p` is 1.
- `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), which is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\).
- `f` is `k - g`.
- `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is \( n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \), `p` is 1, `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**
