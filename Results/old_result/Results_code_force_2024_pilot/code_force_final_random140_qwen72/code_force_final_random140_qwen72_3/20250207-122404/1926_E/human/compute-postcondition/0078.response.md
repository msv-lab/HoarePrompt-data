To determine what will be printed by the `print(y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to calculate `y`.

### Initial State:
- `s` is `k` after all iterations.
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`.
- `d` is 0.
- `h` is 0.
- `p` is `i`.
- `g` is `n`.
- `f` is `k - n`.
- `y` is calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\).

### Explanation:
- `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`.
- `k - n` is the difference between `k` and `n`.
- `y` is calculated using the formula \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\).

### Calculation:
- `y` is the result of \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\).

### Output:
The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\).

Output: **\(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\) (where \(i\) is the number of iterations required to reach \(s = k\), and \(k - n\) is the difference between \(k\) and \(n\))**
