The value of `p` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `p` is 2, so after the increment, `p` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`), `i` must be at least 3, `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`), `h` is now \(\frac{n - 1}{4}\), `p` is now 3, `g` is now \(\frac{n + 1}{2} + \left(\frac{\frac{n - 1}{2} + 1}{2}\right)\), and `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).**
