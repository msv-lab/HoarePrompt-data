To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while p <= i - 1:
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`.

### Current State:
- `p` is 3
- `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `p` and `i`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

Given that `p` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i - 1` must be at least 3. Therefore, `i` must be at least 4.

### Adjustments:
- `p` is already 3, which is fine.
- `i` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 4. All other states remain unchanged.

State: **`s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 4, `d` is 0, `h` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), `p` is 3, `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0**
