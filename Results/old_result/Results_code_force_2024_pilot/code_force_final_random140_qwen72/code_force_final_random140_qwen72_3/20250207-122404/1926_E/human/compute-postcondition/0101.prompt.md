Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    n_back = n
    s = (n + 1) // 2
    n = (n + 1) // 2
    m = 1
    while s < k:
        if n == 0:
            s = n_back
            n = 1
            break
        m *= 2
        n //= 2
        s += n
    print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2^p\) where \(p\) is the number of times the loop executed, `n` is the result of repeatedly dividing the original `n` by 2 until `s` is no longer less than `k`, `n_back` is equal to the original `n`, `s` is equal to \((n + 1) // 2\) plus the sum of all intermediate values of `n` during the loop execution, provided `s` remains less than `k`. If `n` becomes 0 during the loop, `n` is set to 1, `s` is set to the original `n`, and the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is \(2^{\lceil \log_2(k-1) \rceil}\), `s` is `k`, `n` is 0, `n_back` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `s` is `n_back` if `n` became 0 at any point, otherwise it is the sum of the initial `s` and all the values of `n` added during the loop, `n` is 1 if it became 0 at any point, otherwise it is the result of repeatedly halving the initial `n` until it is less than `k`, `n_back` remains the first input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
