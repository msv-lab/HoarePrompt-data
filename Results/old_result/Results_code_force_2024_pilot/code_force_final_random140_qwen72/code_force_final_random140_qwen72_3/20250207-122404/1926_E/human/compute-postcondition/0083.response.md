The code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided. The initial state specifies conditions for various variables based on the values of `n` and `k`. After the code execution, the values of `n` and `k` are updated, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged unless their values depend on the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input. `s` is 0 or `k` depending on whether the new `k` is greater than \((\text{new } n + 1) // 2\) or not. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. `i` is 0 or the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`. `d` is `n` or 0. `h` is `n` or 0. `p` is 1 or `i`. `g` is 0 or `n`. `f` is 0 or `k - n`. `y` is 0 or \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\). If the new `k` > \((\text{new } n + 1) // 2\), `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations, `d` and `h` are 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is `n`, `f` is `k - n`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\). Otherwise, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` and `h` are `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
