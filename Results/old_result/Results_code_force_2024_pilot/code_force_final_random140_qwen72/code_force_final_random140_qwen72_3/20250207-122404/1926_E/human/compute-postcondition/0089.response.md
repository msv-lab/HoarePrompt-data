Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input. `s` is 0. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. `i` is 0. `d` is `n`. `h` is `n`. `p` is 1. `g` is 0. `f` is 0 or `k - n`. `y` is 0 or \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\). If the new `k` > \((\text{new } n + 1) // 2\), `i` is the number of iterations, `d` and `h` are 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is `n`, `f` is `k - n`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\). Otherwise, `i` is 0, `d` and `h` are `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is 0, and `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `g = 0` sets the variable `g` to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
