Output State: **`s` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is 1, `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**
