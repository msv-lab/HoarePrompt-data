Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `m` is 8, `s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + n + n\) or `n_back` depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is 0, `s` is set to `n_back`, `n` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `n` remains \(\lfloor (n + 1) // 2 \rfloor // 2\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated from 4 to 8 because `m *= 2` multiplies `m` by 2.
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `n` remains the same as described in the initial state.
