The value of `h` is updated by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from itself. This operation effectively reduces `h` by half, rounded down. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `i` must be at least 4, if `i = 4`, then `i - 1 = 3`, and `p = 3` will satisfy the condition `p <= i - 1`, `h` is updated to `h - (h + 1) // 2`.**
