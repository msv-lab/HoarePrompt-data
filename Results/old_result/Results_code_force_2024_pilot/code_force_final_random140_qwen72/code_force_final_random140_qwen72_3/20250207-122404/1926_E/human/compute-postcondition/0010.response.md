The value of `s` is updated by adding the result of `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value. Given that `d` is `n`, the expression `(d + 1) // 2` simplifies to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `s` was initially 0, the new value of `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`**.
