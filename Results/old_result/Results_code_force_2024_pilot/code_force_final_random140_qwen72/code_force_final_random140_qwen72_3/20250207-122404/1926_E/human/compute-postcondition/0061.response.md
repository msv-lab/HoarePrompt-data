The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4 + (d + 1) // 2\), `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `i` is 3, `d` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\)**.
