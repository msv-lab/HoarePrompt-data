Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'. If no input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` remains 0. If no input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` remains an empty string. Additionally, `a` is 0.**
