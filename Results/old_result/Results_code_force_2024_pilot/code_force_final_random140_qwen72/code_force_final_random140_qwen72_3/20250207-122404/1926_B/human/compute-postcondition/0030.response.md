Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the last input string processed.
- `a` is 0, indicating that no input string contained exactly one '1'.
- `b` will be 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1', otherwise it remains an empty string.

The `print(b)` statement will print the value of `b`.

Given that `a` is 0, this indicates that no input string contained exactly one '1'. However, the value of `b` depends on whether any input string contained more than one '1'. Since the initial state does not specify that any input string contained more than one '1', we can infer that `b` remains an empty string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'' (an empty string)**
