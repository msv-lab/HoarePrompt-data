Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the new input string, `a` is either 'Triangle' if `s` contains exactly one '1' character, or 0 otherwise, `b` is 'Square'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is set to 'Square'.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
