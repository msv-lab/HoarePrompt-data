To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

- `t` is described as an input integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.
- `i` is the loop variable that starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0**
