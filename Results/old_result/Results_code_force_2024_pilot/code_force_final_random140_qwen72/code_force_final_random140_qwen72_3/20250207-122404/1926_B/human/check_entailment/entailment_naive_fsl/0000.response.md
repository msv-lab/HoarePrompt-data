Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly identifies shapes based on the count of '1's in each row rather than the actual pattern of '1's that form a triangle or a square.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
010
111
010
```
This input represents a triangle with `k=3` (an upside-down triangle). However, the program will incorrectly identify this as a square because it only checks the count of '1's in each row, not their positions.

### Expected Output:
```
TRIANGLE
```

### Actual Output:
```
SQUARE
```

The program fails to correctly identify the shape in this case, hence it is incorrect.
