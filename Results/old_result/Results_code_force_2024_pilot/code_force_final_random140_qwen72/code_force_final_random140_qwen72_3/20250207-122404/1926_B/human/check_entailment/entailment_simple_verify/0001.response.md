### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row `s` in the grid:
     - If the row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'Triangle'.
     - If the row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'Square'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., it was set to 'Triangle'), it prints 'Triangle'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Square'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Triangle Detection**:
  - The logic for detecting a triangle is flawed. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as it grows larger. The current logic will incorrectly identify any row with more than one '1' as a square, even if it is part of a triangle.
  - The function does not check if the '1's in a triangle are centered around a single column, which is a requirement for a valid triangle.
  - The function does not validate the size of the shape to ensure it matches the definition of a triangle or square.

- **No Central Column Check**:
  - The function does not verify that the '1's in a triangle are centered around a single column, which is a critical part of the triangle definition.

- **No Size Validation**:
  - The function does not validate the size of the shape to ensure it matches the definition of a triangle or square. For example, a valid triangle must have rows with increasing or decreasing lengths of '1's, and a valid square must have rows with a consistent length of '1's.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes as per the problem description. It fails to accurately detect triangles and does not perform the necessary checks to ensure the shapes meet the required criteria.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
