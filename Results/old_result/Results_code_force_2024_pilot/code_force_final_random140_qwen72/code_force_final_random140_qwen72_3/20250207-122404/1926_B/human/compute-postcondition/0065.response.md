Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. If any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is 0. If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'. If no input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = 0` sets the variable `a` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for `a` being 'Triangle' if any input string contained exactly one '1' character is reset to 0.
- The conditions for `b` remain the same as in the initial state.
