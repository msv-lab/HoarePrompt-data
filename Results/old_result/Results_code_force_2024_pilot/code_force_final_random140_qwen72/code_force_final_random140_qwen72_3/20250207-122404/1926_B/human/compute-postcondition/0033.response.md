Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. If any input string contained exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` remains an empty string unless a previous input string contained more than one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0, and `b` will be 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**
