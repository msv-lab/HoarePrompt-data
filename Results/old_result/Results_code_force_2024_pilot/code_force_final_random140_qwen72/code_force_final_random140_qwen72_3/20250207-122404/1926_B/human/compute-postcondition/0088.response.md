Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. If any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `j` is `n-1` after the loop completes because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `s` is the last input string processed during the final iteration of the loop.
- The variable `a` will be 'Triangle' if any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character. Otherwise, it remains 0.
- The variable `b` will be 'Square' if any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character. Otherwise, it remains an empty string.
