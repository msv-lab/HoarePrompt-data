Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `s` is the new input string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square' and `a` remains unchanged. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle' and `b` remains unchanged. If `s` does not contain exactly one '1', `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
