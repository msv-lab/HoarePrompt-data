You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

        a = 0

            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'Square'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)

- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid represented by `n` lines of `n` characters ('0' or '1'). For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid contains a 'Triangle' (if any row has exactly one '1') or a 'Square' (if any row has more than one '1'). If no row has exactly one '1', the function will always print 'Square'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly identifies shapes based on the count of '1's in each row rather than the actual pattern of '1's that form a triangle or a square.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
010
111
010
```
This input represents a triangle with `k=3` (an upside-down triangle). However, the program will incorrectly identify this as a square because it only checks the count of '1's in each row, not their positions.

### Expected Output:
```
TRIANGLE
```

### Actual Output:
```
SQUARE
```

The program fails to correctly identify the shape in this case, hence it is incorrect.
