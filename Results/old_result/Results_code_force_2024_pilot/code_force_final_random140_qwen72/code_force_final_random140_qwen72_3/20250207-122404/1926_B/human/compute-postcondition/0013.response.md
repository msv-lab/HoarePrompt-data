Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `s` is an input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.***
