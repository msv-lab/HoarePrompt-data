Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 100, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'Triangle'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'Square'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string processed. If any input string contained exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` remains an empty string unless a previous input string contained more than one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0, and `b` will be 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string processed. If any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'. If no input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string processed. If at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
