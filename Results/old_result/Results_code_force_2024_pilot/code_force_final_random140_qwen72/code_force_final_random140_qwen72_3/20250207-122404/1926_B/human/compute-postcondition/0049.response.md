Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the new input string, `a` is either 'Triangle' if `s` contains exactly one '1' character, or 0 otherwise. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.***
