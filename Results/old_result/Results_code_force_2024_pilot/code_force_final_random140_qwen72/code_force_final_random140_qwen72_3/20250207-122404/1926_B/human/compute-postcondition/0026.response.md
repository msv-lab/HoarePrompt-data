Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. The value of `a` will be 'Triangle' if any input string contained exactly one '1', otherwise it remains 0. The value of `b` will be 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1', otherwise it remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` is the input integer and does not change.
- `j` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has run `n` times.
- `s` will be the last input string processed in the loop.
- `a` will be set to 'Triangle' if any input string contained exactly one '1' during the loop's execution; otherwise, it remains 0.
- `b` will be set to 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1' during the loop's execution; otherwise, it remains an empty string.
