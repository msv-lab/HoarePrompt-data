Postcondition: ***`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `work` is True, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input, `i` is 0, `ans` is now the first character of `a`. Additionally, either `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `len(a)`, or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.***
