Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must have a length of at least 2, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final iteration's conditions, `ans` is a string constructed by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**
