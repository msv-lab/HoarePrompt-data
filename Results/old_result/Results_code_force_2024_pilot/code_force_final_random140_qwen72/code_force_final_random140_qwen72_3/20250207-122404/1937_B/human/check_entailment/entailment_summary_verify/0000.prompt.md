You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Program:

    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()

                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]

                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        print(ans)
        counter = 1
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
        print(counter)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string by alternating characters from the two input strings based on specific conditions. It then prints this constructed string. Additionally, it calculates and prints a counter value based on the comparison of consecutive characters between the two input strings. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `work`, `ans`, `j`, and `counter` in their final states as described in the postconditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string is flawed.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Lexicographically Smallest String Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string by comparing elements from the top row (`a`) and the bottom row (`b`). However, the logic for switching between rows is not robust enough to handle all cases.
   - For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     4
     1101
     1000
     ```
     The lexicographically smallest string should be `10000`, but the program might produce `11000` because it does not correctly handle the transition between rows.

2. **Path Counting:**
   - The program uses a simple counter to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. This approach is not sufficient to handle all cases, especially when multiple transitions between rows are required.
   - For example, in the case where the input is:
     ```
     1
     4
     1101
     1000
     ```
     The program might incorrectly count the number of paths because it does not account for all possible valid transitions.

### Example Input and Output:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4
  1101
  1000
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  10000
  1
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  11000
  1
  ```

The program fails to produce the correct lexicographically smallest string and the correct number of paths for this input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
