Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the first three characters of `a` followed by the character `b[2]` or `b[3]` depending on the value of `i` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, otherwise `ans` remains the first three characters of `a`, and `work` is either True or False.***
