Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 1, and `work` is either True or False depending on the conditions. If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` is False. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character `b[0]`. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b` and `work` is False.***
