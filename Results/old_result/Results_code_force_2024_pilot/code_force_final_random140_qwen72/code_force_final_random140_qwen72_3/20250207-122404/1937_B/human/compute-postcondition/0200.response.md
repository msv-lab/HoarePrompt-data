The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `counter` could be 1 or 2 based on the conditions given in the initial state. If `counter` was 1, it becomes 2. If `counter` was 2, it becomes 3. The values of `j`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `a` is the stripped version of the user input and must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is either 2 or 3 depending on its initial value (if the third element of `a` is equal to the second element of `b`, `counter` was 2 and now is 3; if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` was 1 and now is 2).**
