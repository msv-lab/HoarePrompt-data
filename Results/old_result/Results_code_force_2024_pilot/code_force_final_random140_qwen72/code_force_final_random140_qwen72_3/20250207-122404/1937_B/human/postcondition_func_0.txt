The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string by alternating characters from the two input strings based on specific conditions. It then prints this constructed string. Additionally, it calculates and prints a counter value based on the comparison of consecutive characters between the two input strings. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `work`, `ans`, `j`, and `counter` in their final states as described in the postconditions.
