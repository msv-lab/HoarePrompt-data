Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new stripped input string and must have a length of at least 2, `b` is the new stripped input string, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `ans` is an empty string, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again. If `work` is True, and if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[0]`, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is 1, `ans` remains the first character of `a`, and `work` is True. If `work` is False, `i` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `b`, and `work` remains False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again. If `work` is True, `i` is 2 or 3, `ans` is the first two characters of `a`, and `work` is either True or False. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `i` is 3, and if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is the first two characters of `a` followed by the third character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `work` is False, `i` is 2, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `b`, and `work` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `i` is either 2, 3, or 4, `ans` is the first two characters of `a` followed by either the third character of `a` (if `work` is True and `i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]` is false), or the character `b[2]` or `b[3]` depending on the value of `i` if `i + 1 == len(a)`, or the character `b[i-1]` if `work` is False, and `work` is either True or False.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
