The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` is 2, after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 3, `work` is either True or False depending on the conditions, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character at index 2 of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `b` followed by the character at index 2 of `a` and `work` is False.**
