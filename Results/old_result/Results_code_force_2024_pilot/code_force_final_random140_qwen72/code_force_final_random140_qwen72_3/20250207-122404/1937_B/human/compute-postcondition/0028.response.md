Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 2, `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b` followed by the character at index 2 of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `work` is set to False.
- Since `work` is now False, `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b` followed by the character at index 2 of `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
