Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `i` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `b`, and `work` is True.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += b[i]` appends the second character of `b` (since `i` is 1) to the string `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` contains the first character of `a`.
- After executing the code, `ans` now contains the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `b`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `j`, `counter`, `_`, `i`, and `work`) remain unchanged.
