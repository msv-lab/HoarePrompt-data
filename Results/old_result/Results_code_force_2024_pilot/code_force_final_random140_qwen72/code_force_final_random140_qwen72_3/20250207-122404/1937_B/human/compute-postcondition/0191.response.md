Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `a` is the stripped version of the user input and must have at least 2 elements. The second element of `a` is '0'. The first element of `b` is '1'. If the second element of `a` is equal to the first element of `b`, `counter` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.**
