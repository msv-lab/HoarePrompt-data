Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, and `work` is True. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character `b[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 1, and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`.***
