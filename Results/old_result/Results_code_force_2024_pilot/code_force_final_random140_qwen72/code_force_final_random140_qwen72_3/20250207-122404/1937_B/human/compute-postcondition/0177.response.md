Output State: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input, `work` is as previously determined, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to include the second character of `a` followed by the second character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
