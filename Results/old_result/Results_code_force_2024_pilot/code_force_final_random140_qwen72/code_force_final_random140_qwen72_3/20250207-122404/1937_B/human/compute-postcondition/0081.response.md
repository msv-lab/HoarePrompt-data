Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new stripped input string and must have a length of at least 2, `b` is the new stripped input string, `i` is 0, `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.** 

The variable `work` has been set to False, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
