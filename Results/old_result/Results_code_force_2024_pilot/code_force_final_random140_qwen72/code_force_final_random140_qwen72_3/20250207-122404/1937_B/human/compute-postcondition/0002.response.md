To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which means `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

However, the loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly initialized. The loop will iterate `t` times, and `_` will take values from 0 to `t-1` automatically.

Thus, the state remains as follows:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.**
