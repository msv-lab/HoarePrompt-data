Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is now the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, `work` is False**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
