Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n} are binary strings of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The next line of input is read and stored in the variable `input`. `t` is now the integer value read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must have a length of at least 2, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final iteration's conditions, `ans` is a string constructed by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `j` will be `len(a) - 2`, `counter` will reflect the final count based on the conditions within the loop, `_` will be incremented by the number of iterations (which is `len(a) - 1`), and `work` will be either True or False depending on the last iteration's condition. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the conditions inside the loop, `a` and `b` remain the stripped versions of the user inputs, `i` is `len(a)`, `n` is the input integer, `t` remains unchanged, `ans` is the final concatenated string (if any).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
