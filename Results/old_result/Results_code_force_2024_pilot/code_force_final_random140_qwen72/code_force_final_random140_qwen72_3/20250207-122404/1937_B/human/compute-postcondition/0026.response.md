To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < len(a)`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty.
- `b` is the stripped input string.
- `i` is 1.
- `work` is either True or False depending on the conditions.
  - If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`.
  - If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` is False.
  - If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character `b[0]`.
  - If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b` and `work` is False.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < len(a)`.

### Analysis:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes one more time is `i`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `a`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2 (or any value less than `len(a)`).

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty.
- `b` is the stripped input string.
- `i` is 2.
- `work` is either True or False depending on the conditions.
  - If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`.
  - If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` is False.
  - If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character `b[0]`.
  - If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b` and `work` is False.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 2, and `work` is either True or False depending on the conditions. If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` is False. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character `b[0]`. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b` and `work` is False.**
