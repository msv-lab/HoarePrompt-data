To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **`a`**: This is the stripped version of the user input. For example, if the user input is `"  hello world  "`, then `a` would be `"hello world"` after stripping the leading and trailing spaces.

2. **`b`**: This is the stripped version of the new user input. Similarly, if the new user input is `"  goodbye  "`, then `b` would be `"goodbye"` after stripping the leading and trailing spaces.

3. **`i`**: This is the length of the string `a`. If `a` is `"hello world"`, then `i` would be `11`.

4. **`j`**: This is `len(a) - 2`. If `a` is `"hello world"`, then `j` would be `9`.

5. **`t`**: This is an unspecified range, but it remains unchanged throughout the process. It could be a range like `range(10)`.

6. **`_`**: This is the next value in the range of `t`. For example, if `t` is `range(10)`, then `_` could be any value from `0` to `9`.

7. **`counter`**: This reflects the final count, but the exact value is not specified in the initial state.

8. **`ans`**: This is the final concatenated string formed by the rules specified in the loop. The exact rules for concatenation are not provided, but we can infer that `ans` is a string that is built up through some process involving the variables mentioned.

Given the lack of specific details about the loop and the exact rules for forming `ans`, we can only describe `ans` in general terms based on the provided information.

### Explanation:
- `a` and `b` are stripped versions of user inputs.
- `i` and `j` are derived from the lengths of these strings.
- `t` and `_` are related to a range, but their exact values are not specified.
- `counter` is a final count, but its value is not provided.
- `ans` is the final concatenated string, but the exact rules for concatenation are not given.

### Output:
Since the exact rules for forming `ans` are not provided, we can only describe it in general terms. The `print(ans)` statement will print the final concatenated string `ans` formed by the rules specified in the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is the final concatenated string formed by the rules specified in the loop)**
