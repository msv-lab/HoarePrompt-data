The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `counter` is 1 if the second element of `a` is '0' and the first element of `b` is '1'. Therefore, `counter` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `a` is the stripped version of the user input and must have at least 2 elements, if the second element of `a` is '0' and the first element of `b` is '1', `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 2.**
