Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's condition.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length at least 2, `b` is a string of length at least 2, `j` is 0, `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, otherwise `counter` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's condition. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is 1, `a` is a string of length at least 2, and `len(a) - 1` is at least 1. If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 2, `a` is a string of length at least 3, and `len(a) - 1` is at least 2. If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
