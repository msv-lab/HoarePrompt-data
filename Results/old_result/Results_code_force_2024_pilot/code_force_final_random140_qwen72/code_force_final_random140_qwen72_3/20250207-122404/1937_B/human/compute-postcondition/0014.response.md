Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, and `work` is True. Additionally, either `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a`, or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.***
