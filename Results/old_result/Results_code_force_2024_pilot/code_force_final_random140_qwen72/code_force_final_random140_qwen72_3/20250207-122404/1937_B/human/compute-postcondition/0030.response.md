Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 2, `work` is either True or False depending on the conditions, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character at index 2 of `a` and the character at index 2 of `b` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `b` followed by the character at index 2 of `a` and the character at index 2 of `b` and `work` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
