You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0 (since it represents the number of remaining test cases to process, and all have been processed). For each test case, `n` is the input integer, `a` and `b` are the stripped input strings, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final iteration's conditions, `ans` is the final concatenated string based on the conditions within the loop, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final count based on the conditions inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string by alternating characters from the two input strings based on specific conditions. It then prints this constructed string. Additionally, it calculates and prints a counter value based on the comparison of consecutive characters between the two input strings. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `work`, `ans`, `j`, and `counter` in their final states as described in the postconditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, and two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest path.
   - It uses a boolean variable `work` to decide whether to move right in the top row (`a`) or down to the bottom row (`b`).
   - The loop iterates through the characters of the strings `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
     - If the next character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`, it switches to the bottom row by setting `work` to `False`.
     - If the end of the string is reached, it appends the last character from `b` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it moves to the next character in the top row.
   - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` to `ans` and moves to the next character.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a counter `counter` to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It iterates through the characters of the strings `a` and `b` up to the second-to-last character:
     - If the next character in `a` matches the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
   - Finally, it prints the counter, which represents the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

### Analysis:
- **Path Construction**: The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct. It ensures that the grasshopper always takes the smallest possible value at each step, switching rows when necessary to maintain the smallest string.
- **Path Counting**: The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct. It correctly identifies when the grasshopper can switch between rows and counts the valid paths accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem as described. It constructs the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string.

### Correctness:
**True**
