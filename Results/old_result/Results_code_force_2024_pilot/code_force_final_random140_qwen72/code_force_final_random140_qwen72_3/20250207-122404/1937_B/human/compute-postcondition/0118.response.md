Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's condition.**
