Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- `p` is the first integer from the line.
- `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the line.
- `r` is the third integer from the line.
- `line` is the next line in the file (now consumed).

### Print Statement:
```python
print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `p`, `q`, and `r`:**
   - `p` is the first integer from the line.
   - `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the line.
   - `r` is the third integer from the line.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `q // 3` is the integer division of `q` by 3.
   - `q % 3` is the remainder when `q` is divided by 3.
   - `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]` is a conditional expression that evaluates to either `p - q // 3` or `-1` based on the condition `r < q % 3`.

3. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `-1`.
   - If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `p - q // 3`.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will output either `-1` or `p - q // 3` depending on the condition `r < q % 3`.

Given the initial state and the structure of the print statement, the output will be one of the following:
- If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the output will be `-1`.
- If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the output will be `p - q // 3`.

Since the exact values of `p`, `q`, and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3] (where p is the first integer from the line, q is the sum of the second and third integers from the line, r is the third integer from the line, and the expression evaluates to -1 if r < q % 3, otherwise it evaluates to p - q // 3)**
