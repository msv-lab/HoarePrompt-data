To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- `p` is the first integer from the new line.
- `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the new line plus the third integer from the new line.
- `r` is the third integer from the new line.
- `line` is the next (unconsumed) line in the file.

### Expression Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
```

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate `q`:**
   - `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the new line plus the third integer from the new line.
   - If the second integer is `second` and the third integer is `third`, then:
     \[
     q = second + third + third = second + 2 \times third
     \]

2. **Calculate `q % 3`:**
   - This is the remainder when `q` is divided by 3.
   - Since `q = second + 2 * third`, the value of `q % 3` depends on the values of `second` and `third`.

3. **Calculate `r < q % 3`:**
   - This is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` if `r` is less than `q % 3`, and `False` otherwise.
   - `r` is the third integer from the new line.

4. **Evaluate the tuple `(p - q // 3, -1)`:**
   - This is a tuple with two elements: `p - q // 3` and `-1`.
   - The expression `q // 3` is the integer division of `q` by 3.
   - The result of the `print` statement will be either `p - q // 3` or `-1` depending on the value of `r < q % 3`.

5. **Determine the final value:**
   - If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the expression `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]` will evaluate to `-1`.
   - If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the expression `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]` will evaluate to `p - q // 3`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be either `-1` or `p - q // 3` depending on the condition `r < q % 3`.

Output: **(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3] (where p is the first integer from the new line, q is the sum of the second and third integers from the new line plus the third integer from the new line, r is the third integer from the new line, and the expression evaluates to -1 if r < q % 3, otherwise it evaluates to p - q // 3)**
