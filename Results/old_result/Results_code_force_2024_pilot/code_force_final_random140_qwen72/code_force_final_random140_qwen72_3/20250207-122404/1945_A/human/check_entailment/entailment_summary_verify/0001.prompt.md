You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (p, q, r) = map(int, line.split())
        q += r
        print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads from standard input (or a file), ignoring the first line, and processes each subsequent line. Each line is expected to contain three integers `p`, `q`, and `r`. The function updates `q` by adding `r` to it, then prints a value based on the condition `r < q % 3`. If `r` is less than `q % 3`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `p - q // 3`. The function does not modify the input parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, and it does not return any value. The final state of the program is that all lines in the input have been processed, and the appropriate values have been printed for each line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Introverts must be alone in a tent.
   - Extroverts must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in any type of tent.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert requires a separate tent, so we need `a` tents for introverts.
   - **Extroverts:** Each tent for extroverts must have exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need `b` extroverts to be divided into groups of 3. If `b` is not divisible by 3, we need additional universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be used to fill any remaining spots in tents. They can also form their own tents if necessary.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads input from stdin and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p`, `q`, and `r` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
   - It then adds the number of universals (`r`) to the number of extroverts (`q`), effectively treating universals as potential extroverts.
   - The expression `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]` is used to determine the number of tents:
     - `q // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be formed with extroverts and universals.
     - `p - q // 3` calculates the remaining number of tents needed for introverts after accounting for the full tents.
     - The condition `[r < q % 3]` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If not, it returns `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b` is not divisible by 3 and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, the program correctly returns `-1`.
   - If `b` is divisible by 3, the program correctly calculates the number of tents needed.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the logic for calculating the minimum number of tents required.
   - It correctly handles edge cases where it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
