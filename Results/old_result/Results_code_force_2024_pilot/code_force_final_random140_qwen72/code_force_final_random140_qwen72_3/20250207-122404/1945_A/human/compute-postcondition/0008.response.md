The only object in the loop head is the variable `line`, which is being iterated over a list of lines from the file, starting from the second line. The state of `line` changes with each iteration as it takes the value of the next line in the file.

At the end of the last iteration, `line` was the next line in the file (now consumed). For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line available in the file to be read. Therefore, `line` should now represent the next (unconsumed) line in the file.

Since the loop iterates over all lines in the file except the first one, the only condition for the loop to continue executing is that there is at least one more line left in the file to process.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer from the previous line, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the previous line, `r` is the third integer from the previous line, `line` is the next (unconsumed) line in the file**
