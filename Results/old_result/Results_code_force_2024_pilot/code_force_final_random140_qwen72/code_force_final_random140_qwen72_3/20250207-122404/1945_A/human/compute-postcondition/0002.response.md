The value of `q` is incremented by the value of `r`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The values of `p` and `r` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is an integer read from the first line of the file, `q` is now `q + r`, `r` is an integer read from the first line of the file.**
