Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- `p` is an integer read from the first line of the file.
- `q` is now `q + r`.
- `r` is an integer read from the first line of the file.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading `p` and `r` from the file:**
   - `p` is an integer read from the first line of the file.
   - `r` is an integer read from the first line of the file (assuming it's the same line or another line, but for simplicity, let's assume they are distinct lines).

2. **Calculating `q`:**
   - `q` is initially some value, and then it is updated to `q + r`.

3. **Expression inside the `print` statement:**
   - The expression `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]` is a conditional expression that evaluates to one of two values based on the condition `r < q % 3`.
   - `q % 3` gives the remainder when `q` is divided by 3.
   - `r < q % 3` checks if `r` is less than this remainder.
   - If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `-1`.
   - If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `p - q // 3`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be either `-1` or `p - q // 3` depending on the condition `r < q % 3`.

### Precise Description:
- `p` is the integer read from the first line of the file.
- `r` is the integer read from the first line of the file.
- `q` is the original value of `q` plus `r`.
- The condition `r < q % 3` determines the output:
  - If `r < q % 3` is `True`, the output is `-1`.
  - If `r < q % 3` is `False`, the output is `p - q // 3`.

### Final Output:
Output: **(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3] (where p is the integer read from the first line of the file, q is the original value of q plus r, and r is the integer read from the first line of the file)**
