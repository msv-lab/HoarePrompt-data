To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `line`.
   - The expression `[*open(0)][1:]` is used to create an iterable from the file opened by `open(0)`, starting from the second line.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the iterable `[*open(0)][1:]` contains at least one element.
   - This means that the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least two lines (one for the header and one or more for the data).

3. **Adjustable States:**
   - The only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the content of the file opened by `open(0)`.

### Adjusted State:
- The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least two lines: one for the header and one or more for the data.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least two lines.**
