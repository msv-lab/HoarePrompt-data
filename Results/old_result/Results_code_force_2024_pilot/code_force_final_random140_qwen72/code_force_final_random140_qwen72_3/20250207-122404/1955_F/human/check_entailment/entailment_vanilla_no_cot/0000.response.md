Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The solution provided does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem statement. The logic used in the function `func` is attempting to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the even and odd counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, this approach is flawed because it does not properly account for the bitwise XOR operation and how removing specific numbers affects the overall XOR result.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the XOR operation and how removing certain numbers can change the parity of the XOR sum. Specifically, the goal is to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero (Bob's win condition).

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the provided solution is incorrect:

1. **XOR Properties**: The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of 1s, 3s, and the total count of 2s and 4s (since 2 and 4 are even and do not affect the parity) is even. If the count is odd, the XOR is non-zero.

2. **Optimal Removal**: To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in a way that keeps the XOR zero as often as possible. This means removing numbers that maintain the even count of 1s and 3s.

3. **Flaw in the Provided Solution**:
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the number of pairs of each type of number, which is not directly related to the XOR operation.
   - The term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the parity of the XOR sum.

A correct approach would involve calculating the total count of 1s and 3s and ensuring that the removal of numbers maintains the even count of these numbers as much as possible. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        total_ones_and_threes = a + c
        total_evens = b + d
        total_numbers = a + b + c + d
        
        # Bob wins if the total count of 1s and 3s is even
        bob_wins = total_numbers // 2 - (total_ones_and_threes % 2)
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring that the count of 1s and 3s remains even as numbers are removed.
