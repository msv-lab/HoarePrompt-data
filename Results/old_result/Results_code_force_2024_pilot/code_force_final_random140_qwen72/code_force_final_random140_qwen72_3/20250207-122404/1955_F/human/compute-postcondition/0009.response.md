Output State: **`i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user and each is greater than or equal to 0.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user.
- After all iterations, the loop variable `i` will be `t-1` because the loop starts from `0` and goes up to `t-1`.
- For each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are provided by the user and can be any integer within the specified range (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200). These values are not constrained to be greater than any specific value beyond the initial constraints given in the problem statement.
- Therefore, after all iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` can still be any integer within the range [0, 200].
