The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to the upper limit provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the input value (which determines the upper limit) must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, the input value must be greater than 0**
