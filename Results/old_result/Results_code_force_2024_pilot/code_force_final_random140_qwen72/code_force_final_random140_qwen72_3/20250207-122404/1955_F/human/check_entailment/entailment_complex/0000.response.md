Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The key insight here is to understand how the XOR operation works with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

- **XOR Properties**:
  - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
  - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
  - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
  - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
  - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0\)
  - \(1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)
  - \(2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)

Given these properties, we can see that pairs of the same number (1, 2, 3, or 4) will cancel each other out, and certain combinations of three different numbers will also result in zero.

The function `func` attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the following:
- It divides each count (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) by 2 to account for pairs that will cancel each other out.
- It adds 1 if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` (when divided by 2 and 3 respectively) equals 3, which accounts for the possibility of forming a winning combination with three different numbers.

However, there is a mistake in the logic:
- The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` is incorrect because `c % 3` should be `c % 2` to correctly check the remainder when divided by 2.

The correct expression should be:
```python
int((a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2) == 3)
```

This ensures that the function correctly checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` (when divided by 2) equals 3.

Given this correction, the function would correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Corrected Function:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int((a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2) == 3))
```

Since the original function has a logical error, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
