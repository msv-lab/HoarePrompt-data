Let's break down the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2 (though it is not used in the `print` statement).
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user and each is greater than 1.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a // 2`: This is the integer division of `a` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `b // 2`: This is the integer division of `b` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `c // 2`: This is the integer division of `c` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `d // 2`: This is the integer division of `d` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`: This part checks if the sum of the remainders of `a` divided by 2, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 3 equals 3. If true, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

3. **Combining the Results:**
   - The `print` statement sums up the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, and adds the result of the boolean check.

4. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are specific values greater than 1. For example:
     - `a = 5`
     - `b = 7`
     - `c = 8`
     - `d = 9`
   - Calculate each part:
     - `a // 2 = 5 // 2 = 2`
     - `b // 2 = 7 // 2 = 3`
     - `c // 2 = 8 // 2 = 4`
     - `d // 2 = 9 // 2 = 4`
     - `a % 2 = 5 % 2 = 1`
     - `b % 2 = 7 % 2 = 1`
     - `c % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2`
     - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
     - `int(4 == 3) = 0` (since 4 is not equal to 3)

5. **Final Sum:**
   - `2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 13`

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the sum of the integer divisions plus the result of the boolean check.

Output: **13 (where 13 is the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus the result of the boolean check)**
