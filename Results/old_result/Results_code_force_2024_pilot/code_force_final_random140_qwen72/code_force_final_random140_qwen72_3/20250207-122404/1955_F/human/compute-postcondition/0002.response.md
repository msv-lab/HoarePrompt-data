To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a // 2`: This is the integer division of `a` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `b // 2`: This is the integer division of `b` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `c // 2`: This is the integer division of `c` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `d // 2`: This is the integer division of `d` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`: This part checks if the sum of the remainders of `a` divided by 2, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 3 equals 3. If it does, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

3. **Combining the Parts:**
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` adds the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, and then adds 1 if the condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` is true, or 0 if it is false.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the result of the above expression.

Given the initial state and the expression, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` is true, or 0 if it is false.

Output: **(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))**
