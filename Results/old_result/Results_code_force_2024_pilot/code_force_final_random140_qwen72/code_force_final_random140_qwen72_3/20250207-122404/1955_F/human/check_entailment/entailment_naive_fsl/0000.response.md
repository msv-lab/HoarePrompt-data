Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total number of elements (sum of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) is odd. In such cases, the program incorrectly assumes that Bob can always win by removing pairs of elements, which is not always true. For example, consider the input `1 0 0 0`:

- The sequence contains only one '1'.
- The bitwise XOR of this sequence is `1`, which means Alice wins.
- Removing this '1' results in an empty sequence, and the bitwise XOR of an empty sequence is `0`, which means Bob wins.

However, the program will output `0` for this case, indicating that Bob cannot win, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because Bob wins once the '1' is removed. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
