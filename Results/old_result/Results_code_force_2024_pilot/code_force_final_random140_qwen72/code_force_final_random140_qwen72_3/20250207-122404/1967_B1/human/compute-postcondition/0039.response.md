Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the initial value of `t`, `n` and `m` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, and `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)` for the last iteration.**

Explanation:
- `T` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t - 1`.
- `t` remains the same as its initial value because it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` and `m` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
- `b` will be `min(n, m) + 1` because the inner loop runs from `1` to `min(n, m)`, and `b` will be incremented one more time after the last valid iteration.
- `ans` will be the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from `1` to `min(n, m)` for the last iteration of the loop.
