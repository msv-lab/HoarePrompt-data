Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The core issue lies in the logic used to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The program incorrectly calculates the sum of `n // b + 1` for all `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, which does not correspond to the required condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through possible values of `b` and for each `b`, find the number of valid `a` values such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This requires a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

Given the current implementation, the program will produce incorrect results for most test cases because it does not check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Correctness: **False**
