Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b). The program iterates over `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)` and adds `n // b + 1` to the answer. This approach does not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Iterate over possible values of `b`.
2. For each `b`, find the number of valid `a` values such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, this solution might be too slow for large inputs due to its O(n * m) complexity. A more efficient approach would be needed to handle the constraints of the problem.
