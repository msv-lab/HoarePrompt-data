To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head. The loop head specifies that `b` should iterate over the range from 1 to `min(n, m) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `min(n, m)` must be at least 1. This means both `n` and `m` must be at least 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, respectively.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `T` is 0.
- `ans` is 0.

We need to ensure that `n` and `m` are at least 1, and `b` starts at 1. The other variables (`t`, `T`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, both must be at least 1, `b` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is 0**
