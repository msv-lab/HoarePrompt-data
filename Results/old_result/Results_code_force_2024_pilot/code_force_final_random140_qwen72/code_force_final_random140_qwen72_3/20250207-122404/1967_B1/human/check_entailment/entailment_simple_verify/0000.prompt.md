You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the initial value of `t`, `n` and `m` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, and `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)` for the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The program iterates over `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, which is not correct. According to the problem, `b` should range from 1 to `m`, and `a` should range from 1 to `n`.
   - The program incorrectly adds `n // b + 1` to the answer for each `b`. This does not account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Missing GCD Calculation**:
   - The program does not calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is essential for checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The program does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it simply adds `n // b + 1` to the answer, which is not the correct way to count valid pairs.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The correct output should be `3` because the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`. However, the given program will produce an incorrect output.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. For each pair `(a, b)`, calculate `gcd(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly count the number of valid pairs for each test case.
