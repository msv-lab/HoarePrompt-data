The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. The current value of `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`. Since `b` is 3, `n // b` will be the integer division of `n` by 3. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2 + n // 3 + 1`.

Output State: **`[n, m]` are converted to integers and both must be at least 3, `T` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `b` is 3, `ans` is `n + n // 2 + n // 3 + 3`**.
