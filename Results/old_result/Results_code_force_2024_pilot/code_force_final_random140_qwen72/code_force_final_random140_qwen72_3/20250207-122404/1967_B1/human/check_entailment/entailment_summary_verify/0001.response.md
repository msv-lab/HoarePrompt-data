### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - Additionally, \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the count of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \(n // b + 1\) to `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The key issue is in the line `ans = ans + n // b + 1`. This does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expression \(n // b + 1\) is not the correct way to count the valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\), but it does not consider the gcd condition.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Alternatively, we can use a more efficient approach by leveraging properties of gcd and divisors.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
