Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input values as integers, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `sum(n // i + 1 for i in range(1, min(n, m) + 1))`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain the same as they were initially provided.
- **`b`**: After the loop completes, `b` will be `min(n, m) + 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
- **`t` and `T`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. This is because the loop adds `n // b + 1` to `ans` for each iteration of `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
