The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial state (which were the first and second positive integers from the input) to the new values provided by the user.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are already the first and second positive integers from the input, the new values of `n` and `m` will be the strings representing the new input values. The other variables (`b`, `t`, `T`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input values as strings, `b` is `min(n, m)` (where `n` and `m` are the original positive integers), `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)` (where `n` and `m` are the original positive integers).**
