The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers, the input should be two positive integers separated by a space.

The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged, and the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `T` is 0 still holds true.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, respectively; `t` is greater than 0; `T` is 0.**
