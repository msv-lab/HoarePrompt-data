Output State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, both must be at least 1, `b` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans = ans + n // b + 1` updates the value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and `b` is 1. The expression `n // b` performs integer division of `n` by `b`, which results in `n` since `b` is 1. Adding 1 to this result gives `n + 1`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
