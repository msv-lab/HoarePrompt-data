Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input values as integers, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)`**.

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are converted from strings to integers.
- The value of `b` remains `min(n, m)`, which is the minimum of the new integer values of `n` and `m`.
- The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` remains the same, as it is calculated based on the original values of `n` and `m`.
