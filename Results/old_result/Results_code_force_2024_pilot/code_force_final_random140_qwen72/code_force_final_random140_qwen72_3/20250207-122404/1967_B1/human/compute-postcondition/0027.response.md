To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for T in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `T` and the variable `t`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` and `m` are the new input values as integers.
   - `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `T` is 1.
   - `ans` is `sum(n // i + 1 for i in range(1, min(n, m) + 1))`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `T` is less than `t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1.
   - For the next iteration, `T` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `T` will be incremented to 2.
   - `t` remains the same (greater than 1).

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` and `m` remain the same as they are not modified in the loop head.
- `b` remains the same as it is derived from `n` and `m`.
- `t` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.
- `T` is incremented to 2.
- `ans` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` and `m` are the new input values as integers, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 2, `ans` is `sum(n // i + 1 for i in range(1, min(n, m) + 1))`**.
