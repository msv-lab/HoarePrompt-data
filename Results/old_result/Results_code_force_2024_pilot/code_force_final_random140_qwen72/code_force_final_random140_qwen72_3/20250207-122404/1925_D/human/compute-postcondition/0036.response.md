The code snippet updates the value of `den` by dividing it by `g`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `den` was initially defined as `2 * C * C`.
- `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.

After executing `den = den // g`, the new value of `den` is `2 * C * C // g`.

The rest of the variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `g`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third part of each input line over `p` iterations, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is now `2 * C * C // g`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`.**
