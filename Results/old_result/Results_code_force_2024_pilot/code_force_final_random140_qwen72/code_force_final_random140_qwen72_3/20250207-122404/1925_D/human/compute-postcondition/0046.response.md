The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `p` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `p` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of 0 and the integer value from the third part of the input, `i` is 1**
