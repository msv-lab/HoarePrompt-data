Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`T`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: The loop runs `p` times, so `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value (it doesn't change during the loop).
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`S`**: Initially 0, `S` accumulates the integer values from the third part of each input provided during the loop. After `p` iterations, `S` will be the sum of these values.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `p-1`, as the loop index starts at 0 and increments up to `p-1`.
