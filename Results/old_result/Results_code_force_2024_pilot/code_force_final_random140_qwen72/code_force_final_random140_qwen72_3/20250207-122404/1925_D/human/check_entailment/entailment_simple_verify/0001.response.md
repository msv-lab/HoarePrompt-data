### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `p`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It then reads the friendship values for each pair of friends and sums them up in `S`.

2. **Total Possible Pairs**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs of children using the combination formula \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the numerator `num` and the denominator `den` for the expected value.
   - The formula used for the numerator is \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \).
   - The formula used for the denominator is \( 2 \cdot C \cdot C \).

4. **Simplification**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of the denominator modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The program multiplies the simplified numerator by the modular inverse of the denominator and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to get the final answer.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The calculation of the total number of possible pairs \( C \) is correct.
- The formula used for the expected value is derived from the problem statement and is correct.
- The use of the GCD to simplify the fraction and the modular inverse to compute the final answer is appropriate and follows the problem constraints.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used for the numerator. The formula \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \) seems to be incorrect. The correct formula should be derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values over all excursions. The correct formula should be:

\[ \text{num} = k \cdot (S + p) \]

This is because each friend pair's friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion it is chosen, and the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen is \( \frac{k}{C} \). Therefore, the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair is \( \frac{k}{C} \), and the total expected increase for all pairs is \( k \cdot (S + p) \).

### Corrected Formula:
- The numerator should be \( \text{num} = k \cdot (S + p) \).
- The denominator remains \( \text{den} = C \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, p, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        S = 0
        
        for i in range(p):
            S += int(input().split()[2])
        
        C = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        num = k * (S + p)
        den = C
        
        g = math.gcd(num, den)
        
        num = num // g
        den = den // g
        
        den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
        
        ans = num * den % MOD
        
        print(ans)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the incorrect formula used for the numerator. The corrected program uses the correct formula and should produce the correct results.

Final: **False**
