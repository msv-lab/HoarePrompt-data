The value of `num` is updated to `num // g`. This means `num` is divided by the greatest common divisor (`g`) of `num` and `den`, and the result is stored back in `num`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`.**
