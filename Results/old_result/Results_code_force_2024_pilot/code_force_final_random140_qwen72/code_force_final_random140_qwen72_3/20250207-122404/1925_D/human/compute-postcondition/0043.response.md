To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(p):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `p`.
- For the loop to execute, `p` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `p` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `i` should start at 0.

### Final State:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` must be greater than 0
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is 0
- `i` is 0

### Formatted Answer:
State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is 0, `i` is 0**
