The code snippet `S += int(input().split()[2])` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and adds the integer value of the third part to `S`.

Given the Initial State:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` must be greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of 0 and the integer value from the third part of the input
- `i` is 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `S` is updated by adding the integer value from the third part of the new input to its current value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the original `S` and the integer value from the third part of the new input, `i` is 1.**
