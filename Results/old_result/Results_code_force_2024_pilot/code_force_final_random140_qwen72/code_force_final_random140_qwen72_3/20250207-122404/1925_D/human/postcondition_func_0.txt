The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of children (`n`), pairs of friends (`p`), and excursions (`k`). For each test case, it reads the friendship values for the first `p` pairs of friends, calculates a specific mathematical expression involving these values, and prints the result modulo 1000000007. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result for each test case directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects that all test cases have been processed and their results printed.
