To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs
- `i` is `p-1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`
- `den` is `2 * C * C`

### Code Snippet:
```python
g = math.gcd(num, den)
```

### Impact of the Code:
- The `math.gcd` function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
- The result of this computation is assigned to the variable `g`.

### Calculation:
- `num` is calculated as `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`.
- `den` is calculated as `2 * C * C`.
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`.

### Output State:
- All initial conditions remain unchanged except for the new variable `g` which is the GCD of `num` and `den`.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`.**
