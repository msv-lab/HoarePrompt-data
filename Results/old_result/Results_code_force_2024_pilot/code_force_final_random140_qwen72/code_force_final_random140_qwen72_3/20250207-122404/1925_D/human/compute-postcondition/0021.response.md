The only object in the loop head is the variable `T`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`**
