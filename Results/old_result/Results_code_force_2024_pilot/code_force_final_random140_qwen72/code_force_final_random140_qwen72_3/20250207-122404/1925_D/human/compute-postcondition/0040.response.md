The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` was decremented by 1 (`T` is `T - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, all other initial conditions remain unchanged**
