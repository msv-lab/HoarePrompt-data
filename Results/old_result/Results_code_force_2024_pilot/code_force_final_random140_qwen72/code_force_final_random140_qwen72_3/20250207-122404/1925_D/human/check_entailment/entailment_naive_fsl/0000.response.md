Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `num` and `den` is incorrect. The program uses:

```python
num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
den = 2 * C * C
```

However, the correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values should be derived from the probability of selecting a friend pair and the increase in friendship value over multiple excursions. The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion and summing these values.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the initial sum of friendship values.
2. Calculating the probability of selecting a friend pair.
3. Using the probability to determine the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion.
4. Summing the expected increases over all excursions.

The current implementation does not correctly handle these steps, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
The expected output should be 4, but the program will produce a different result due to the incorrect formula used.
