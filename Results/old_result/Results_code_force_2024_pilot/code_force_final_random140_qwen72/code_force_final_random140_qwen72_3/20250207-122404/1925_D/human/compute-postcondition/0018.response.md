The code snippet `den = pow(den, -1, MOD)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` under modulo `MOD`. This means that `den` is updated to the value that, when multiplied by the original `den`, gives a result of 1 modulo `MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs
- `i` is `p-1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `num` is now `num // g`
- `den` is now `(2 * C * C) // g`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `den` is updated to the modular multiplicative inverse of the original `den` under modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`.**
