To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `T` is updated to `T - 1`.
- `ans` is calculated as `num * den % MOD`.

### Variables:
- `T`: This variable is updated to `T - 1`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `ans`: This is the result of the expression `num * den % MOD`.

### Explanation:
- `num` and `den` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume they are predefined variables with some values.
- `MOD` is also not explicitly defined, but it is typically a constant used in modular arithmetic, often a large prime number.
- The expression `num * den % MOD` calculates the product of `num` and `den`, and then takes the remainder when this product is divided by `MOD`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the result of the expression `num * den % MOD`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of num * den % MOD)**
