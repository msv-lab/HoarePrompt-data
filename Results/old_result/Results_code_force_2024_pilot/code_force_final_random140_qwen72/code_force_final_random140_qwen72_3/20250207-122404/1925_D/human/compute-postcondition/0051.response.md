Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times, `i` is `p - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `T` remains decremented by 1 as it was not modified within the loop.
- The variable `ans` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- The variable `p` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- The variable `k` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- The variable `S` is now the sum of the integer values extracted from the third part of each input line, accumulated over all `p` iterations of the loop.
- The loop index `i` ends up being `p - 1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from `0` to `p - 1`.
