Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input. However, there is a minor issue in the variable naming: the variable `p` should be `m` to match the problem description.

2. **Summing Friendship Values**: The function correctly sums the initial friendship values `f_i` for the `m` pairs of friends. This is done using a loop that reads the third element of each line and adds it to `S`.

3. **Combination Calculation**: The function calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the combination formula \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The function attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{num} = m \cdot k \cdot k - m \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S
   \]
   \[
   \text{den} = 2 \cdot C \cdot C
   \]
   This formula seems to be derived from the problem's constraints and the need to account for the increasing friendship values over multiple excursions.

5. **GCD and Modulo Inverse**: The function correctly simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). It then computes the modular inverse of the denominator and multiplies it by the numerator to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used to calculate the expected value. The formula should be carefully derived to ensure it correctly accounts for the increasing friendship values over multiple excursions. The current formula might not be accurate, especially in how it handles the increasing friendship values.

Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues with the formula, the correctness of the program is questionable. However, based on the provided reasoning and the structure of the program, it appears to follow the general logic required by the problem.

Correctness: **False**

The formula used to calculate the expected value might not be accurate, and the variable naming (`p` instead of `m`) could lead to confusion. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the program is correct.
