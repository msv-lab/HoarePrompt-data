### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `p`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It then reads the friendship values for each pair of friends and sums them up in `S`.

2. **Total Possible Pairs**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs of children using the combination formula \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the numerator `num` and the denominator `den` for the expected value.
   - The numerator is calculated as \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \).
   - The denominator is calculated as \( 2 \cdot C \cdot C \).

4. **Simplification**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of the denominator modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The program multiplies the simplified numerator by the modular inverse of the denominator and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to get the final answer.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The calculation of the total number of possible pairs \( C \) is correct.
- The formula used for the expected value is derived from the problem statement and is correct.
- The use of the GCD to simplify the fraction and the modular inverse to compute the final answer is appropriate and follows the problem constraints.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula for the numerator:
- The term \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k \) seems to be derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values, but it might not be accurate. The expected value should consider the probability of selecting each pair and how the friendship values change over the excursions.

### Correct Formula:
The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values after \( k \) excursions can be derived as follows:
- The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{C} \).
- The expected increase in the friendship value of a specific pair of friends after \( k \) excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{1}{C} \).
- The total expected increase in the friendship value for all pairs of friends is \( S \cdot k \cdot \frac{1}{C} \).
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values after \( k \) excursions is \( S + S \cdot k \cdot \frac{1}{C} \).

Thus, the correct numerator should be:
\[ \text{num} = S \cdot (1 + k \cdot \frac{1}{C}) \]

### Revised Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, p, k) = map(int, input().split())
        S = 0
        for i in range(p):
            S += int(input().split()[2])
        C = n * (n - 1) // 2
        num = S * (1 + k * C) % MOD
        den = C
        g = math.gcd(num, den)
        num = num // g
        den = den // g
        den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
        ans = num * den % MOD
        print(ans)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was partially correct in terms of input handling, total possible pairs, and the use of GCD and modular inverse.
- However, the formula for the expected value was incorrect, leading to potential inaccuracies in the results.

Final: **False**
