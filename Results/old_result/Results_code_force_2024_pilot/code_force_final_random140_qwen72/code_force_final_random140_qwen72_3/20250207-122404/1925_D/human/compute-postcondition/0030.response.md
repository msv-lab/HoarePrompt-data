Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third part of each input line over `p` iterations, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`T`**: The condition that `T` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: The value of `p` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop, but it must be greater than or equal to its initial value to ensure the loop runs the required number of times.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`S`**: After all iterations, `S` will be the sum of the integer values of the third part of each input line over `p` iterations.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `p-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `p-1`.
- **`C`**: The value of `C` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`num`**: The value of `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`den`**: The value of `den` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: The value of `g` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`T`**: The value of `T` is decremented by 1 after the loop completes, as specified in the initial state.
