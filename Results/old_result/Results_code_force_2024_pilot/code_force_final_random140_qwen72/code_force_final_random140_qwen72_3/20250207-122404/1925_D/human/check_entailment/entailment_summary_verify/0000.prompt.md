You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, p, k) = map(int, input().split())
        S = 0
        for i in range(p):
            S += int(input().split()[2])
        C = n * (n - 1) // 2
        num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
        den = 2 * C * C
        g = math.gcd(num, den)
        num = num // g
        den = den // g
        den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
        ans = num * den % MOD
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of children (`n`), pairs of friends (`p`), and excursions (`k`). For each test case, it reads the friendship values for the first `p` pairs of friends, calculates a specific mathematical expression involving these values, and prints the result modulo 1000000007. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result for each test case directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects that all test cases have been processed and their results printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `num` and `den` is incorrect. The program uses:

```python
num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
den = 2 * C * C
```

However, the correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values should be derived from the probability of selecting a friend pair and the increase in friendship value over multiple excursions. The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion and summing these values.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the initial sum of friendship values.
2. Calculating the probability of selecting a friend pair.
3. Using the probability to determine the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion.
4. Summing the expected increases over all excursions.

The current implementation does not correctly handle these steps, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
The expected output should be 4, but the program will produce a different result due to the incorrect formula used.
