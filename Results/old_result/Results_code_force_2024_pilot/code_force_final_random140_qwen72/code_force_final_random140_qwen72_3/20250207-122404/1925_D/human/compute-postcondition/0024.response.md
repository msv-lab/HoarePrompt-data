To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `p`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains `i` and `p`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `p` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `p-1`.

### Given State:
- `T` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `p` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value.
- `S` is 0.
- `i` is `p-1`.
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `num` is now `num // g`.
- `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`.
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`.
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.
- `T` is `T - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`p`**: For the loop to execute, `p` must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: The loop initializes `i` to 0, so we need to adjust `i` to 0.

### Final State:
- `T` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value.
- `S` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `num` is now `num // g`.
- `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`.
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`.
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.
- `T` is `T - 1`.

### State:
**`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `S` is 0, `i` is 0, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`**
