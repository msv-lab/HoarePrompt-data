Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third part of each input line over `p` iterations, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `C = n * (n - 1) // 2` updates the value of `C` to be the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `num`, `den`, `g`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `C` is explicitly stated in the output state.
