Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third part of each input line over `p` iterations, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is now `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `den` to `2 * C * C`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `g`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `T` is decremented by 1, so `T` is now `T - 1`.
