The code snippet `n, p, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `p`, and `k` after converting them to integers. The initial state specifies that `T` must be greater than 0, but this state is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
