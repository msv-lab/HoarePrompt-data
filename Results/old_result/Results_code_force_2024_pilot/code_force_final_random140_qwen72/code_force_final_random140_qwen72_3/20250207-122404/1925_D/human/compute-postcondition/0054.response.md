The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `den`. Let's break down the impact:

- `den` is calculated as `2 * C * C`.
- `C` is defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times
- `i` is `p - 1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`

The new value of `den` is `2 * C * C`, which simplifies to `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`**.
