To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is `T - 1`: This indicates that `T` is being decremented by 1, but it doesn't affect the value of `ans`.
   - `ans` is `(num * den) % MOD`: This is the final value that will be printed.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `p` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times.
   - `i` is `p - 1`: This is used in the context of the loop or iteration, but it doesn't directly affect `ans`.
   - `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`: This is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, also known as the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{2}\).
   - `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`: This is the numerator of the fraction used in the calculation of `ans`.
   - `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // g` under modulo `MOD`: This is the denominator of the fraction used in the calculation of `ans`.
   - `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and the original `den`.

2. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `num` is calculated as \((p \cdot k^2 - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S) // g\).
   - `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{2 \cdot C \cdot C}{g} \mod MOD\).
   - `ans` is then calculated as \((num \cdot den) \mod MOD\).

Given the complexity of the formula and the dependencies on the input values, we cannot provide an exact numerical value for `ans` without specific values for `n`, `p`, `k`, and `S`. However, we can describe the process and the final form of the output.

**Output:**
Output: **(num * den) % MOD (where num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g, den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // g under modulo MOD, and g is the GCD of num and the original den)**

This output describes the value of `ans` in terms of the given variables and their relationships.
