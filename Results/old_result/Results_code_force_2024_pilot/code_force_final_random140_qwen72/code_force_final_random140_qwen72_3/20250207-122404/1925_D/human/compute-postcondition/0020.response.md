To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs.
   - `i` is `p-1`.
   - `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `num` is now `num // g`.
   - `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`.
   - `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`.
   - `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items (binomial coefficient).
   - `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
   - `num` is updated to `num // g`.
   - `den` is updated to the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `num * den % MOD`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `ans` is the result of the expression `num * den % MOD`.
   - Since the exact values of `num` and `den` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and their operations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of num * den % MOD, with num being the updated value of num after division by g, and den being the modular multiplicative inverse of (2 * C * C) // g under modulo MOD)**
