Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `S` is the integer value of the third part of the input plus the integer value of the third part of the new input, `i` is 1, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `S` is updated by adding the integer value of the third part of the new input.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `g`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `T` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
- The conditions regarding `n`, `p`, and `k` being input integers and `p` being greater than 0 and greater than or equal to its initial value are still valid.
- The values of `C`, `num`, `den`, `g`, and `ans` are still based on their previous definitions and calculations.
- The value of `T` is decremented by 1.
