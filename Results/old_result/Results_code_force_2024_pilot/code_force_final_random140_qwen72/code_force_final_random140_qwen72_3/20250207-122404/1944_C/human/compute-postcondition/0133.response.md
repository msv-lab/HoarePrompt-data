Output State: **`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 2, `once` is now True, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
