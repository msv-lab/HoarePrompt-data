Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players, Alice and Bob, have played optimally. The key points to consider are:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. The program uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the input array `arr`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX.
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1` and checks:
     - If an integer `i` does not appear in the array (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If an integer `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and continues. This ensures that Alice can pick the first unique integer to maximize the MEX.
     - If an integer `i` appears exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array, ensuring that the MEX is `n`.
   - The program also handles the case where some integers are missing or appear more than once.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases are handled correctly:
     - For the input `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, the MEX is `2`.
     - For the input `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, the MEX is `1`.
     - For the input `[1, 1]`, the MEX is `0`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
