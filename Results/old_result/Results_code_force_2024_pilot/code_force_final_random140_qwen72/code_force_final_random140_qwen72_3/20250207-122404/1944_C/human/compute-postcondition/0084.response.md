Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 1, `once` is True, `counter[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `ans`. Since `i` is 1 and `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 (implying `counter[1]` is 1), and `once` was initially False, the conditions for setting `ans` to 1 and `once` to True are met. Therefore, `ans` is set to 1, and `once` is set to True. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
