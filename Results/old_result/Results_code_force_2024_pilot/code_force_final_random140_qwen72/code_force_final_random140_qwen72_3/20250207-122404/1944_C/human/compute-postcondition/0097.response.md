Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `once` is True. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
