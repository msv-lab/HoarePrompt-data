Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is False, `once` becomes True and `ans` is set to 3. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is already True, `ans` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
