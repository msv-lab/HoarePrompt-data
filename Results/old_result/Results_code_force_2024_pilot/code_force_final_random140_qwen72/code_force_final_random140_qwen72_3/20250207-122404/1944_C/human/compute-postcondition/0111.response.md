Output State: **`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `counter[i]` is the final frequency count of the last element in `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The entire list `arr` has been processed.
- The dictionary `counter` now contains the count of how many times each element in `arr` appears.
- The variable `i` holds the value of the last element in `arr`.
- The value of `counter[i]` is the total number of times the last element in `arr` appears in the list.
