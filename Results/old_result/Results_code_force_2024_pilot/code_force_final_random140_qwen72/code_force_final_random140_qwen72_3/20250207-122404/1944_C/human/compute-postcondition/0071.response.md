Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 1, `once` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, and the current value of `counter[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i + 1` updates the value of `ans` to be `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
