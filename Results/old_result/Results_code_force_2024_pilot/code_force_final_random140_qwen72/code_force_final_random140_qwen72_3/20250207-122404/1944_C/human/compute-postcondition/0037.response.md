Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 1. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` was initially False, then `once` is now True and `ans` is set to 2. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` was already True, or if `counter.get(i, 0) != 1`, then `ans` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
