Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is 2, `once` is True**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `ans`. Since `ans` was already 2, there is no change in its value. All other variables (`arr`, `counter`, `i`, `n`, and `once`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the same values as the initial state.
