The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arr`.

- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer.
- The code does not affect the value of `t` or `n`.
- A new variable `arr` is created and assigned a list of integers based on the user's input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
