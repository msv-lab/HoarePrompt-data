The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then finds the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once. If there are multiple such integers, it chooses the smallest one. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
