Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new boolean variable `once` to `False`. This does not affect the other variables, so their values remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers, `counter` is a dictionary with counts of elements in `arr`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, and `ans` is 0. After executing the code, these values remain the same, and `once` is now set to `False`.
