The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, and `counter[i]` is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `counter[i]` is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`**
