You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

            elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
                once = True
                ans = i + 1

                ans = i

        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, `arr` is the last list of integers from the final test case, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in the last `arr`, `i` is the last element of the last `arr`, `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the last `arr` or appears exactly once (if `once` is True), and `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in the last `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then finds the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once. If there are multiple such integers, it chooses the smallest one. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` until it is empty.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then counts the frequency of each element in the array using a dictionary `counter`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To determine the final score, the program iterates through the range `[0, n-1]` and checks the following conditions:
     - If the current number `i` is not present in the array (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If the current number `i` is present exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and updates `ans` to `i + 1`.
     - If the current number `i` is present exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest missing number (MEX) by iterating through the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - It handles the case where a number appears exactly once by ensuring that Alice can pick it to maximize the MEX.
   - The logic ensures that the final score is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same or arrays with unique elements.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
