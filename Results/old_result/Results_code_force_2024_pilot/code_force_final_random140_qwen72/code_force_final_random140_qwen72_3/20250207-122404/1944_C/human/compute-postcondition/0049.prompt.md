Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` now contains each unique element from `arr` as keys, with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 0, and `once` is initially False. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, and if `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 1, `once` is set to True, and the current value of `counter[i]` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and if `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 1. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, `ans` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` was initially False, then `once` is now True and `ans` is set to 2. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` was already True, or if `counter.get(i, 0) != 1`, then `ans` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 2. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, `ans` is 2, `once` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `ans` is 3 and `once` is True. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, then `ans` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) > 1`, `ans` and `once` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
