Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `once` is True.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `once` to `True`.
- No other variables are modified by this code snippet.
- The conditions and values of `arr`, `counter`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `once` and retains the initial state of the other variables.
