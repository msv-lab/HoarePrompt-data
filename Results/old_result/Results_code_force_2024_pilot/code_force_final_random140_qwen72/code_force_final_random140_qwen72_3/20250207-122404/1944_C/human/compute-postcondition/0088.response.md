Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 1, `once` is True, and `counter[1]` is 1. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is already True, or if `counter.get(i, 0)` is greater than 1, the program continues executing as normal. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 2 and `once` is True.***
