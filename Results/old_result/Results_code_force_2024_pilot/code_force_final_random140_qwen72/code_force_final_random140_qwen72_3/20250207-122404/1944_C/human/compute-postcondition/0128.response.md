Postcondition: ***`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, the frequency count of the first element in `arr` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 1, `once` is set to True, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1, indicating that the first element in `arr` appears exactly once. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is not 0 and not 1, or if `once` is already True, then `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0.***
