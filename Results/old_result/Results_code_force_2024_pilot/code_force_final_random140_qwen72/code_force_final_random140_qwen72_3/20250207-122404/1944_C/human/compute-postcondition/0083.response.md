Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `once` is True, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = i + 1` assigns the value of `i + 1` to the variable `ans`. Since `i` is initially 1, `ans` becomes 2. The other variables (`arr`, `counter`, `n`, and `once`) remain unchanged.
