Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` now contains each unique element from `arr` as keys, with their corresponding counts as values, and `i` is the last element of `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer.
- The list `arr` remains the same list of integers provided as input.
- The dictionary `counter` now contains each unique element from `arr` as keys, with the number of times each element appears in `arr` as the corresponding values.
- The variable `i` holds the value of the last element in `arr`.
