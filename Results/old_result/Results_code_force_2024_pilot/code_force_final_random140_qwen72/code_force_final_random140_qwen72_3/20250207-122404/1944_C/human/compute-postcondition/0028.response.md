Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 0, and `once` is initially False. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, and if `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 1, `once` is set to True, and the current value of `counter[i]` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and if `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
