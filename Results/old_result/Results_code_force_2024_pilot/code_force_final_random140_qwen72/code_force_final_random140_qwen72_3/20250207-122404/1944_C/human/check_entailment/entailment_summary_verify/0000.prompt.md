You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from heapq import *

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        counter = {}
        for i in arr:
            counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
        ans = 0
        once = False
        for i in range(n):
            if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
                ans = i
                break
            elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once):
                once = True
                ans = i + 1
            elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
                ans = i
                break
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then finds the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once. If there are multiple such integers, it chooses the smallest one. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `arr` contains only elements that appear more than once. In such a scenario, the variable `once` will never be set to `True`, and the loop will continue until it finds the first missing integer. However, the correct behavior should ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally to either maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
0 0 1 1 2 2
```
The expected output should be `3` because Alice and Bob can play optimally to ensure that the MEX of the array `c` is `3`. However, the program will output `0` because it incorrectly assumes that the first missing integer is the MEX without considering the optimal play strategy.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.
