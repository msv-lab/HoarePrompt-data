Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 1, `once` is True, `counter[1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `ans`.
- Since `i` is 1, and the condition `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 (implying `counter[1]` is 1), and `once` is False, the code sets `ans` to 1, `once` to True, and confirms that `counter[1]` is 1.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
