Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 1, `once` is initially False, `ans` is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new assignment of `ans` to 1.
