Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `arr` contains only elements that appear more than once. In such a scenario, the variable `once` will never be set to `True`, and the loop will continue until it finds the first missing integer. However, the correct behavior should ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally to either maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
0 0 1 1 2 2
```
The expected output should be `3` because Alice and Bob can play optimally to ensure that the MEX of the array `c` is `3`. However, the program will output `0` because it incorrectly assumes that the first missing integer is the MEX without considering the optimal play strategy.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.
