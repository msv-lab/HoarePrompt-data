The only objects in the loop head are the variables `(n, password)` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, and `password` is a non-empty string. For the loop to execute one more time, the `test_cases` list must have at least 3 elements, and the next element to be processed will be the third element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string.**
