Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `results` is a list containing one element 'NO', `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string. After the loop has executed all iterations, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. Additionally, either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order, or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order.**
