Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description for verifying strong passwords. It checks the following:

1. All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. There is no digit that comes after a letter.

The program processes each test case by separating the letters and digits from the password, then checking if they are sorted. It also ensures that if both letters and digits are present, no digit appears after a letter. The program handles all edge cases and inputs as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
