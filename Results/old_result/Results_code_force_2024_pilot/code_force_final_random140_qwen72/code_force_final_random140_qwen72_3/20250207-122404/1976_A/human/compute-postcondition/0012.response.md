The only object in the loop head is the variable `ch`, which is the current character from the string `password`. The loop iterates over each character in `password`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `password` must be considered.

At the end of the last iteration, `ch` was the first character of `password`. For the next iteration, `ch` will be the second character of `password`.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character in `password`. If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is neither a lowercase Latin letter nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.**
