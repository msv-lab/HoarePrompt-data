You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input('Number of test cases, t = '))
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input('Length of password, n: '))
    password = input('enter passowrd: ').strip()
    test_cases.append((n, password))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if letters and digits and (password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` made up of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function evaluates each string in `test_cases` to determine if the alphabetic characters and digits within the string are in sorted order and if no alphabetic character appears after any digit. It returns a list `results` where each element is either 'YES' if the conditions are met for the corresponding string, or 'NO' if any condition is not met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - If both letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is implicitly handled by the input format and the separation logic.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is checked by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any).
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the list of digits to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the list of letters to its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
