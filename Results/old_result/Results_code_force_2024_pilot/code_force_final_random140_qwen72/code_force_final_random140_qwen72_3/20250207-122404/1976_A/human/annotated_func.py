#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits
            [0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The variable `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each `password` in `test_cases`. For each `password`, if the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order, or the digits in `digits` are not in sorted order, or if `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, then the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each password in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` corresponds to whether the conditions for the respective password in `test_cases` are met. If the alphabetic characters are not in sorted order, or the digits are not in sorted order, or if the last alphabetic character appears after the first digit in the password, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, it is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` made up of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function evaluates each string in `test_cases` to determine if the alphabetic characters and digits within the string are in sorted order and if no alphabetic character appears after any digit. It returns a list `results` where each element is either 'YES' if the conditions are met for the corresponding string, or 'NO' if any condition is not met.
