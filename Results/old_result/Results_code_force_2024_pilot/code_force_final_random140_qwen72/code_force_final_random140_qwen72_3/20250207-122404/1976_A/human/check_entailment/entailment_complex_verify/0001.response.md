### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - If both letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is implicitly handled by the input format and the separation logic. The program assumes valid inputs, so this condition is satisfied.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is checked by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any). The logic in the program correctly identifies this condition.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the list of digits to its sorted version. The program correctly identifies this condition.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the list of letters to its sorted version. The program correctly identifies this condition.

### Annotations Verification:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and checks the conditions as described.
- The state of the program before and after the function call is accurately described, ensuring that the input and output are handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
