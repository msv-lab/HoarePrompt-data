To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`.
- `password` is a non-empty string.
- After the loop has executed all iterations, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digits from `password` in the order they appear.
- If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last letter in `letters` appears after the first digit in `digits` in the `password`, then `results` is a list containing the element 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the element 'YES'.

### Loop Head:
```python
for (n, password) in test_cases:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the `test_cases` list.
- Each iteration processes the next tuple `(n, password)` from the `test_cases` list.
- The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `test_cases`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only objects in the loop head are `test_cases`, `n`, and `password`.
- To execute the next iteration, the loop needs to move to the next element in `test_cases`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains the same because it is the total number of test cases.
- `test_cases` still has the same structure, but the next element in the list will be processed.
- `(n, password)` will be the next element in `test_cases`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string.**
