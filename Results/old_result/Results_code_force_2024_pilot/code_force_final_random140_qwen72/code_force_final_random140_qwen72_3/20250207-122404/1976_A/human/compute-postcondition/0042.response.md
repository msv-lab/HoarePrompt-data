Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the first character of `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` contains `ch` and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` contains `ch` and `letters` remains an empty string.***
