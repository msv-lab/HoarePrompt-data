Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Character Separation**: The program separates the characters of the password into two strings: one for letters and one for digits. This is done using a loop that checks if each character is an alphabet or a digit. This step is also implemented correctly.

3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the original lists of letters and digits with their sorted versions. If they are not equal, the password is marked as invalid. This check is correct.

4. **Order of Letters and Digits**: The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. It does this by checking if the last letter (if any) appears after the first digit (if any). This is a crucial check to ensure that no digit follows a letter, which is correctly implemented.

5. **Output**: The program appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on the above checks and prints the results for each test case. This part is also handled correctly.

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement and handles the edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
