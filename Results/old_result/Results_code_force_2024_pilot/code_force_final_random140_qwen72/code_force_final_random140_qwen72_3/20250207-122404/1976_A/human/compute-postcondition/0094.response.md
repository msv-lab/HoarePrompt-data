Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The variable `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each `password` in `test_cases`. For each `password`, if the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order, or the digits in `digits` are not in sorted order, or if `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, then the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.**
