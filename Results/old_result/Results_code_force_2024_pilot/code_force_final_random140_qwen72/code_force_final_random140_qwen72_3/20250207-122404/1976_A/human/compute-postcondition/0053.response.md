Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string. After the loop has executed all iterations, `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digit characters from `password` in the order they appear.**

This means that after the loop has completed its execution, the variable `letters` will contain all the alphabetic characters from the `password` string, and the variable `digits` will contain all the digit characters from the `password` string, both in the order they originally appeared in `password`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `password`) remain unchanged.
