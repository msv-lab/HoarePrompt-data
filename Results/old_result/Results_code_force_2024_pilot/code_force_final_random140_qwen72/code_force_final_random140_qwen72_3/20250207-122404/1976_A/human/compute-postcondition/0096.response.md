The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`. Here, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each password in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` corresponds to whether the conditions for the respective password in `test_cases` are met. Specifically:
- If the alphabetic characters in the password are not in sorted order, or the digits in the password are not in sorted order, or if the last alphabetic character appears after the first digit in the password, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'.
- Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the alphabetic characters and digits in the corresponding password are in sorted order and no alphabetic character appears after any digit, and 'NO' otherwise.**
