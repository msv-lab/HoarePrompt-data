Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`.
- `password` is a non-empty string.
- `ch` is the third character of `password`.
- If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch` repeated twice, and `digits` is an empty string.
- If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is an empty string, and `digits` is a string containing `ch`.

The code snippet:
```python
letters += ch
```

### Analysis:
- The code appends the character `ch` to the string `letters`.
- If `ch` was an alphabetic character, `letters` initially contained `ch` repeated twice. After appending `ch` again, `letters` will contain `ch` three times.
- If `ch` was a digit, `letters` was initially an empty string. After appending `ch`, `letters` will contain `ch` once.

### Output State:
- If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` will be a string containing `ch` repeated three times.
- If `ch` is a digit, `letters` will be a string containing `ch` once.
- The value of `digits` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `password`, `ch`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the third character of `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch` repeated three times, and `digits` is an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is a string containing `ch` once, and `digits` is a string containing `ch`.**
