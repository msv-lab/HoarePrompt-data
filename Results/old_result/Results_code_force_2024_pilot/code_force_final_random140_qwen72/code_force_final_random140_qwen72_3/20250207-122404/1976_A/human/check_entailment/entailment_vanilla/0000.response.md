### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - If both letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is implicitly handled by the input format and the separation logic.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is checked by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any).
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the list of digits to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the list of letters to its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
