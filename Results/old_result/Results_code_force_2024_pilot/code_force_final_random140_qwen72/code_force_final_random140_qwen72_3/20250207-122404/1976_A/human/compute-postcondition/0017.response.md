The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ch` and the list `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in `password`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ch` was the second character in `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ch` must now be the third character in `password`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `results` is an empty list, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, and `ch` is the third character in `password`. If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is neither a lowercase Latin letter nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.**
