Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n >= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, and `ch` is the third character of `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` contains the first four characters of `password` and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` contains the first two characters of `password` followed by `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string.***
