### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - If both letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is implicitly handled by the input format and the separation logic. The program does not explicitly check for invalid characters, but the problem statement guarantees valid inputs.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. The program checks this by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any). This is done using the condition `password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])` when both letters and digits are present.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. The program checks this by comparing the list of digits to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. The program checks this by comparing the list of letters to its sorted version.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the password consists of only letters or only digits, the program should still handle it correctly. The conditions for sorting and the order of letters and digits are trivially satisfied in these cases.
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are no letters or no digits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles the input, processes each test case, and produces the correct output for the given examples and edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
