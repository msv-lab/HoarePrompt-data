Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each password in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` corresponds to whether the conditions for the respective password in `test_cases` are met. If the alphabetic characters are not in sorted order, or the digits are not in sorted order, or if the last alphabetic character appears after the first digit in the password, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, it is 'YES'.**
