The only object in the loop head is the variable `ch`, which is derived from iterating over the string `password`. The state of `password` itself does not change, but the value of `ch` changes with each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `ch` was the second character of `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ch` must now be the third character of `password`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the third character of `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch` repeated twice, and `digits` is an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is an empty string, and `digits` is a string containing `ch`.**
