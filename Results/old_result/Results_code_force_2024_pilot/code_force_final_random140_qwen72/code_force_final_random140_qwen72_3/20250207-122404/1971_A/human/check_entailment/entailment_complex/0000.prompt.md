Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers where 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and all pairs of integers (a, b) have been processed, printing the maximum and minimum of each pair.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 100`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (where `0 <= a, b <= 9`) from the input, and prints the maximum and minimum of these two integers. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all input pairs `(a, b)` have been processed and their maximum and minimum values have been printed.
