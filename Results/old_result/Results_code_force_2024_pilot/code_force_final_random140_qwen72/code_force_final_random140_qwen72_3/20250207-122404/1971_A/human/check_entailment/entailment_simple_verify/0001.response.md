Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
3. According to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`.
4. However, the current implementation prints the maximum of `a` and `b` first, followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the order of the printed values is reversed compared to what the problem statement requires. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
