Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from the input.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The `max(a, b)` function returns the larger of the two integers `a` and `b`.
2. The `min(a, b)` function returns the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.
3. The `print` statement will output the results of these two functions in the order they are called.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the relationship between `a` and `b`.

Output: **max(a, b), min(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the larger of the two integers a and b, and min(a, b) is the smaller of the two integers a and b)**
