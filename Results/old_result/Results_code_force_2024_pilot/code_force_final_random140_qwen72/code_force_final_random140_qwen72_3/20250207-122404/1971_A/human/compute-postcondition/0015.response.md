The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
