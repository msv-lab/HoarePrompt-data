Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9
- `i` is 1
- `a` and `b` are input integers

The print statement is:
```
print(b, ' ', a)
```

This statement will print the value of `b` followed by a space and then the value of `a`.

Since `a` and `b` are input integers, their exact values are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b` that are provided as input.

Output: **b a (where b and a are the input integers)**
