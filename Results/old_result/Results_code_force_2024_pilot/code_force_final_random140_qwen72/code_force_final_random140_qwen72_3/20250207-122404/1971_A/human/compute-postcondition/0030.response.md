Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variable `t` remains 0. The final state of the program includes the processed inputs and the printed results for each test case. **
