Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
3. According to the problem description, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`.
4. However, the current implementation prints `max(a, b)` followed by `min(a, b)`, which is the reverse of what is required.

The function summary confirms that the function processes the input as described and prints the maximum and minimum values in the wrong order. This means that the program does not produce the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
