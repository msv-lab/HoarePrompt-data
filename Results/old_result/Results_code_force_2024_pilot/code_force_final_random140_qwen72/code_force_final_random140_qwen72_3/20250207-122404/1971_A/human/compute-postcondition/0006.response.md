Initial State: `t` is now 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Variables and Their Values**:
   - `a`: This is the first integer from the input.
   - `b`: This is the second integer from the input.
   - `t`: This variable is mentioned but not used in the `print` statement. It is 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, but this does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement uses the `max` and `min` functions to determine the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `b`.
   - `max(a, b)`: This will return the larger of the two integers `a` and `b`.
   - `min(a, b)`: This will return the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the maximum value followed by the minimum value of `a` and `b`.

Output: **max(a, b), min(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the larger of the two integers a and b, and min(a, b) is the smaller of the two integers a and b)**
