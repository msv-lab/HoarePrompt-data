Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program prints the maximum of `a` and `b` first, followed by the minimum. According to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` first, followed by the maximum. Therefore, the order of printing in the program is incorrect. It should be:

```python
print(min(a, b), max(a, b))
```
