The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, no changes are made to the variables. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to the variables either.**
