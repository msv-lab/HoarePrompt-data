To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `a` is the first integer from the new input.
- `b` is the second integer from the new input.
- `t` must be greater than 0.

### Code:
```python
print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables `a` and `b`**:
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided as input.
   - The values of `a` and `b` are not explicitly given, but they are the first and second integers from the new input, respectively.

2. **Function `max(a, b)`**:
   - This function returns the larger of the two integers `a` and `b`.

3. **Function `min(a, b)`**:
   - This function returns the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the maximum and minimum of the two integers `a` and `b` in that order.

Output: **max(a, b), min(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the larger of the two integers a and b, and min(a, b) is the smaller of the two integers a and b)**
