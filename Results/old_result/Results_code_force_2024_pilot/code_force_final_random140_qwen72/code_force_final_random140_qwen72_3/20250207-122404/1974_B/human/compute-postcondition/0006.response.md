Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from a reversed mapping of the unique characters in `encoded`. Specifically, the unique characters in `encoded` are sorted, and each character is mapped to its counterpart in the reverse order of this sorted list. **
