#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by replacing each character in the original string `encoded` with its corresponding character as mapped in `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each character in `r` (which is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` joined together) to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from a reversed mapping of the unique characters in `encoded`. Specifically, the unique characters in `encoded` are sorted, and each character is mapped to its counterpart in the reverse order of this sorted list.
