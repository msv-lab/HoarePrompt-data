Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `r` is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` joined together, `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each character in `r` to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a dictionary `char_map` where each key is a character from the string `r`, and each value is the corresponding character from `r` in reverse order.
- For example, if `r` is "abc", then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
- The values of `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `r` remain unchanged.
