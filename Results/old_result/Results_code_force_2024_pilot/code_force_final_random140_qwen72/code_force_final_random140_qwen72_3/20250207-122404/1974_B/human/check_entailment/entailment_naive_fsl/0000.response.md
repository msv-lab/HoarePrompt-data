Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the decoded strings. The function `func_1` constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique, sorted characters of the encoded string, creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart, and then decodes the encoded string using this mapping. This approach ensures that the decoding is done according to the specified algorithm, and the program handles all edge cases, such as strings of length 1 and strings with repeated characters. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
