Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - **Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in the reversed order of `r`.
   - **Decoding**: It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results of all test cases and prints them, each on a new line.

The program accurately follows the steps required to decode the string as specified in the problem statement. The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly maps and decodes the characters.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
