The code joins the elements of the list `unique_chars` into a single string and assigns this string to the variable `r`. Since `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, the value of `r` will be a string containing these unique characters in the same order as they appear in `unique_chars`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `r` is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` joined together.**
