The code snippet provided decodes the string `encoded` using the mapping defined in `char_map`. Each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character as defined in `char_map`, and the resulting characters are joined together to form the `decoded` string.

Given the initial state:
- `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
- `r` is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` joined together.
- `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each character in `r` to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.

The code:
```python
decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
```
This line of code creates a new string `decoded` by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character in `char_map`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `r` is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` joined together, `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each character in `r` to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`, `decoded` is a string formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character in `char_map`.**
