### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the input list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string itself.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string and appends the result to a list `results`.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Extract Unique Characters:**
     - It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - **Create Character Mapping:**
     - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, etc.).
   - **Decode the String:**
     - It decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.
   - **Return Decoded String:**
     - It returns the decoded string.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the decoded strings, each on a new line.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case as described.
- The decoding logic is implemented correctly:
  - It correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters.
  - It correctly maps each character to its symmetric counterpart.
  - It correctly applies the mapping to decode the string.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
