Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the decoding logic as specified in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list `data`. It then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It extracts the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string itself.
   - It calls the `func_1` function to decode the string.
3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It finds the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reverse order of `r`.
   - **Decoding**: It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped character from `char_map`.

The logic ensures that the decoding process is the reverse of the encoding process described in the problem statement. Each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters, which is exactly how the problem specifies the decoding should work.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
