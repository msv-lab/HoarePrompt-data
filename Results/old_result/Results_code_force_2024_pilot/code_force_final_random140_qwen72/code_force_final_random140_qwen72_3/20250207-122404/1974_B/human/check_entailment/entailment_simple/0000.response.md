Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly follow the steps required to decode the string according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it should work:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list `data`. It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It extracts the length `n` and the encoded string `encoded` for each test case.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, etc.).
   - **Decoding**: It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.

The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. The use of a set to find unique characters and sorting them ensures that the string `r` is constructed correctly. The mapping and replacement steps also follow the specified symmetric replacement rule.

Given that the program follows the correct steps and handles the input and output as required, it should produce the correct decoded strings for the given encoded strings.

Correctness: **True**
