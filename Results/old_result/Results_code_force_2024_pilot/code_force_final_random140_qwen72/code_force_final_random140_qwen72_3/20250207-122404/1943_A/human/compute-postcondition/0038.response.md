Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
- The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0.
- `j` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is explicitly set to 3.
- The `print` statement will simply print the value of `j`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `j`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
