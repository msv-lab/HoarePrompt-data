Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. `_` is 1.
2. `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0.
3. `a` is a list of integers read from input.
4. `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
5. The first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0.
6. `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
7. `j` is 1.
8. The value of `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 and less than 2.
9. Additionally, `c` is 0.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the values:

- `c` is 0, which means `cntl[0]` must be greater than 1 (since the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` would be 1 if `cntl[0]` were 1 or less).
- `j` is 1.
- `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 and less than 2, which means `cntl[1]` must be 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(j)
```

Since `j` is explicitly set to 1, the output will be:
Output: **1**
