Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
- The first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the integer `0`.
- The value `0` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **0**
