Output State: **_ is 1, n is an updated input integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers read from input, cntl is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i (where i is an element in a) is incremented by the number of times i appears in a.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `_` remains 1, `n` remains the same updated input integer greater than 0, and the list `a` remains unchanged. The list `cntl` now reflects the count of each integer in `a`, with each element at index `i` in `cntl` being incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
