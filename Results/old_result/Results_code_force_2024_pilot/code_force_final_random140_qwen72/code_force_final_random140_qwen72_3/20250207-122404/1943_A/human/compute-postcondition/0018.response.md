Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
   - The first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0.
   - `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly set to 1.
   - The value of `j` does not change based on any conditions or operations in the provided initial state.
   - Therefore, the `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`, which is 1.

4. **Output:**
   Output: **1**
