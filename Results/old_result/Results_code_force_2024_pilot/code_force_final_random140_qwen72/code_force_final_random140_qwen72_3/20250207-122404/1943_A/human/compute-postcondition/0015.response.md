To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` should start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 (this ensures the loop can execute)
- `a` is a list of integers read from input (not relevant to the loop head)
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0 (not directly relevant to the loop head, but it affects the loop's behavior indirectly)
- The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and cntl[0] (not directly relevant to the loop head)

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
- `n` is greater than 0 (already given)
- `j` starts at 1 (this is automatically handled by the `range(1, n + 1)` function)

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, the first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and cntl[0], `j` is 1**
