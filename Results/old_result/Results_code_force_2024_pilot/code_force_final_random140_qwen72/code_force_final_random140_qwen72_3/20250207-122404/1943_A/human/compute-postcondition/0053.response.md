The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is the first element in the list `a`, and `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0
- `i` is the first element in `a`

After executing the code snippet:
- The value at index `i` in the list `cntl` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` (which is the first element in `a`) incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in `a`.**
