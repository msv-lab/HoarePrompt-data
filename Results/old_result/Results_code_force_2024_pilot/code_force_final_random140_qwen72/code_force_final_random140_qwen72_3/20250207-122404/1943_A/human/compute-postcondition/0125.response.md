Based on the initial and adjusted states provided:

- `j` was initially 1.
- In the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.
- The loop condition is that `j` must be less than or equal to `n`, and since `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` is 2 when the `print` statement is executed.

Therefore, the `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
