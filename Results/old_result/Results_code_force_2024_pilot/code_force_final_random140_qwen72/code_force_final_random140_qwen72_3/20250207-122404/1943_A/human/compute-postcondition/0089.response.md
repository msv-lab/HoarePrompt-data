Based on the initial state provided:

- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.
- The value of `j` should be 3.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `c` is decreased by 1.

The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Since the initial state explicitly states that `j` should be 3, the value of `j` is 3.

Output: **3**
