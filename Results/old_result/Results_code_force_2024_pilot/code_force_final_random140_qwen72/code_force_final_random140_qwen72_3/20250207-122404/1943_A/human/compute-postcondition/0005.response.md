The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The index `i` is the first element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (the first element in `a`) is now 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the first element in `a`**.
