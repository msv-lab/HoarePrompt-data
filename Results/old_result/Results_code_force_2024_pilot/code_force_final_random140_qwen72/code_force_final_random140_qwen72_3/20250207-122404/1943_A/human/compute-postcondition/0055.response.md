The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is the second element in the list `a`, and `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (which is the first element in `a`) was already incremented by 1. After the code executes, the element at index `i` in `cntl` is incremented again by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` (which is the first element in `a`) incremented by 2, `i` is the second element in `a`.**
