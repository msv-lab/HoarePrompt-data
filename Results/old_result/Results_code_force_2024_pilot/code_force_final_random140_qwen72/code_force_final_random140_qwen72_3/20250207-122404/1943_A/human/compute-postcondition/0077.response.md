Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
   - The first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0.
   - `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly set to 2.
   - The `print` statement will simply print the value of `j`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `j` is 2, the `print` statement will output the integer 2.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **2**
