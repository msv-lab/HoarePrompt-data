The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, and the loop depends on the input value. For the loop to execute, the input must be converted to an integer and this integer must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts includes the description of `t`, but since `t` is not directly used in the loop head, we focus on the input value.

State: **`_` is 0 (initially), the input value must be an integer greater than 0**
