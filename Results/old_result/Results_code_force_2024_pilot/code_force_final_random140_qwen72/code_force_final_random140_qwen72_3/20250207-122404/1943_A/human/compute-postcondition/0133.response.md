The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented to 3.
- `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`a` remains a list of integers, `cntl` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 3.**
