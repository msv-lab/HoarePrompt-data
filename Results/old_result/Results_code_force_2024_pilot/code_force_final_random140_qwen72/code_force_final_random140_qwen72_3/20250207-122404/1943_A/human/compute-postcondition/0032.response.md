Based on the initial state:

- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
- The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0.
- `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`.
- `j` is 2.

The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Since `j` is explicitly set to 2, the output will be:

Output: **2**
