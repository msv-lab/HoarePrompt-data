Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. `_` is set to 1. This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0. This variable is also not directly used in the `print` statement.
3. `a` is a list of integers read from input. This list is used to populate the `cntl` list.
4. `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`. This means `cntl[i]` will contain the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`.
5. The first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0. This implies that `cntl[0]` has some non-zero value.
6. `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`. Since `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` will be 1.
7. `j` is set to 2. This is the value that will be printed.

Given this information, the `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
