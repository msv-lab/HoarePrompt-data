Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`.
- `cntl[0]` is not 0.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- The current value of `cntl[j]` is 0.

The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Given that `j` is explicitly set to 1, the output will be:

Output: **1**
