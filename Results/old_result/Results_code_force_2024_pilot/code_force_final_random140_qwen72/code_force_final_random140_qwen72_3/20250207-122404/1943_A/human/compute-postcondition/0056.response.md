The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` (which is the first element in `a`) incremented by 2, and `i` is the second element in `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements. The next value of `i` will be the third element in `a`.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` (which is the first element in `a`) incremented by 2, `i` is the third element in `a`**
