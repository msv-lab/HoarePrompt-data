Postcondition: **_ is 1, n is an updated input integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers read from input, cntl is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i (where i is an element in a) is incremented by the number of times i appears in a. If cntl[0] == 0, the first element of cntl (cntl[0]) is 0. Otherwise, the value of `j` is `n + 1`, and the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, and `cntl` remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the possible decrement of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop.**
