Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 but less than 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is decremented by 1, so `c` is now the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
