Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 0, n is an input integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers read from input, cntl is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i (where i is an element in a) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of i in a, and all other elements are 0, the first element of cntl (cntl[0]) is not 0, c is the minimum of 2 and cntl[0].
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, the first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and cntl[0], `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 and less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`, and if `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, the first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0, `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`, and if `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, the first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0, `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is decreased by 1, and if `c` becomes 0, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
