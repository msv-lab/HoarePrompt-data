Postcondition: ***`a` remains a list of integers, `cntl` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, either `c` is decreased by 1 (and if `c` becomes 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `cntl[j]` is 0.***
