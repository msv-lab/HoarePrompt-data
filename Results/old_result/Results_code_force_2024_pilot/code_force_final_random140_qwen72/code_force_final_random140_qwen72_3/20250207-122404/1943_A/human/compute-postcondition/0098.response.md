Output State: **_ is 2, n is an updated input integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers read from input, cntl is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i (where i is an element in a) is incremented by the number of times i appears in a. If cntl[0] == 0, the first element of cntl (cntl[0]) is 0. Otherwise, the value of `j` is `n + 1`, and the loop has completed all its iterations.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `_` is 2, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `a` to a list of integers read from input.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including the conditions about `cntl` and `j`.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a` while keeping the other variables and conditions intact.
