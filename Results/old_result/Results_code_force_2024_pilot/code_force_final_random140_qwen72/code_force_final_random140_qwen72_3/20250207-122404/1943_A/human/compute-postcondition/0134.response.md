Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties, and `cntl[0]` is not 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `n` is at least 3.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(j)
```

Given that `j` is explicitly set to 3, the `print` statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
