Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
- The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `c` is decreased by 1 (though `c` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(j)
```

Given that `j` is explicitly set to 3, the print statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
