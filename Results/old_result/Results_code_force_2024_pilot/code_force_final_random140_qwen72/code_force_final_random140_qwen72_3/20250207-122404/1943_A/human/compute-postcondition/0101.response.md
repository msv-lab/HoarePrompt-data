The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the first element of `a`, `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. The list `a` and the variable `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
