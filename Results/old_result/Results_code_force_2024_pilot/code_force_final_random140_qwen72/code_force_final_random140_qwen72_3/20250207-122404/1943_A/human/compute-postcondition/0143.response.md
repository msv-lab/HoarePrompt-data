Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`. The loop has completed all its iterations. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the condition holds as is. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is the smallest integer between 1 and `n` such that `cntl[j]` is 0 or `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and `c` is 0, and `n` is at least the value of `j`. If no such `j` exists, the loop completes without printing any value.***
