Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and the first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `c` is set to the minimum of 2 and the value at `cntl[0]`. Since `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` will be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cntl[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
