The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` represents the number of islands, and `k` represents the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of islands, and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
