The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1. Since `reachable_count` was initially equal to `n`, after decrementing, `reachable_count` is now `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `reachable_count` is `n - 1`.**
