Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly handle the case where \( k < n - 1 \). In such cases, the optimal strategy for Dominater is to isolate the island 1 from as many other islands as possible, which means destroying \( k \) bridges that connect island 1 to other islands. This would leave Everule with \( n - k \) islands that he can still visit, including island 1 itself.

However, the function `func_1` returns `n` when \( k < n - 1 \), which is incorrect because it suggests that Everule can still visit all islands, which is not true if Dominater destroys \( k \) bridges optimally.

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n - k
```

This ensures that the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is calculated correctly based on the optimal destruction of bridges by Dominater.
