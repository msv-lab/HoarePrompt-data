The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `reachable_count` was `n - 2`, so after decrementing, `reachable_count` becomes `n - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is now `k - (n - 3)`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 3`**.
