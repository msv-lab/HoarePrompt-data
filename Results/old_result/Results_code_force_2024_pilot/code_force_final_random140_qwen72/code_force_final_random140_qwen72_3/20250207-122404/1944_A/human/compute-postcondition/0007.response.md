To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `k`
   - `reachable_count`

2. **Current State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`
   - `qs` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `_` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`

3. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
     - `k >= reachable_count - 1`
     - `k > 0`

4. **Current Values:**
   - `k` is `k - (n - 1)`
   - `reachable_count` is `n - 1`

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still satisfy both conditions:
     - `k >= reachable_count - 1`
     - `k > 0`

6. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - `k >= reachable_count - 1` translates to `k >= (n - 1) - 1` or `k >= n - 2`
   - `k > 0` must also be true

7. **Current Value of `k`:**
   - `k` is `k - (n - 1)`

8. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - To ensure `k >= n - 2` and `k > 0`:
     - `k - (n - 1) >= n - 2`
     - Simplifying, `k - n + 1 >= n - 2`
     - `k - n + 1 >= n - 2` simplifies to `k >= 2n - 3`
     - Additionally, `k - (n - 1) > 0` simplifies to `k > n - 1`

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` must be adjusted such that:
- `k >= 2n - 3`
- `k > n - 1`

Since `k` is already `k - (n - 1)`, we need to ensure that the initial `k` was large enough to satisfy these conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `2n - 3` and greater than `n - 1`**
