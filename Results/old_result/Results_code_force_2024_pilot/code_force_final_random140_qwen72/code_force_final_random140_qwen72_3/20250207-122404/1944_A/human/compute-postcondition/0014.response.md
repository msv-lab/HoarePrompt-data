Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is now `k - (n-1) - (n-2) - ... - 1`.
   - `qs` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `reachable_count` is equal to 1.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(reachable_count)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `reachable_count` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
   - The value of `reachable_count` does not change between the initial state and the execution of the print statement.
   - Therefore, the value of `reachable_count` when the print statement is executed is 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `reachable_count`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
