Let's break down the initial state and determine the value of `reachable_count`:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n`: The first integer from the new input.
   - `k`: Now `k - (sum of (n - i) for i from 1 to n-1)`.
   - `qs`: Must be greater than 0.
   - `_`: Is 2.
   - `reachable_count`: Is 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is a positive integer within a specified range.
   - `n` is an integer input.
   - `k` is modified by subtracting the sum of a series from it. The series is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n - i) \). This sum can be simplified to \( \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n-1 \) natural numbers.
   - `qs` is a positive integer.
   - `_` is a placeholder with a value of 2.
   - `reachable_count` is explicitly set to 1.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(reachable_count)`.
   - Since `reachable_count` is explicitly set to 1, the value printed will be 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
