Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n - 1) - (n - 2)`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 2`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `2n - 3` and greater than `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1, changing from `n - 1` to `n - 2`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
