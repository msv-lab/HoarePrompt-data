### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` islands, initially fully connected by bridges.
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater's optimal destruction.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `k >= n - 1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If `k < n - 1`, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely. Everule will still be able to visit all `n` islands because even if some bridges are destroyed, there will still be paths connecting all islands.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` checks if `k >= n - 1`.
     - If true, it returns 1 (Everule can only visit island 1).
     - If false, it returns `n` (Everule can visit all `n` islands).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k = 0`, no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - When `k = n - 1`, Dominater can destroy exactly enough bridges to isolate island 1, so Everule can only visit island 1.
   - For any `k` such that `0 < k < n - 1`, Everule can still visit all `n` islands because the remaining bridges will still form a connected graph.

5. **Test Case Verification:**
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 0`, the output should be 2 (both islands are reachable).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output should be 1 (only island 1 is reachable).
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 1`, the output should be 4 (all islands are reachable).
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 10`, the output should be 1 (only island 1 is reachable).
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the output should be 5 (all islands are reachable).
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the output should be 1 (only island 1 is reachable).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater's optimal bridge destruction. The function `func_1` handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
