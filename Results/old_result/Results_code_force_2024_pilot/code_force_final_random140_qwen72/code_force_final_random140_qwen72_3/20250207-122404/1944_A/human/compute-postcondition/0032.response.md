To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `k`
   - `reachable_count`

2. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `k` is the second integer from the new input, and `k` is now `k % (n - 1)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` otherwise `k` is 0
   - `qs` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `_` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `reachable_count` is equal to `n`

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
     - `k >= reachable_count - 1`
     - `k > 0`

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0.
   - Additionally, `k` must be greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is either `k % (n - 1)` or 0.
- `reachable_count` is equal to `n`.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

Since `reachable_count` is equal to `n`, the condition `k >= reachable_count - 1` simplifies to `k >= n - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`**
