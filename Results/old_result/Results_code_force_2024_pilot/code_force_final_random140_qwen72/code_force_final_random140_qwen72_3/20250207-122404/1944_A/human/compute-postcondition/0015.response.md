The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `qs`. If `qs` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n-1) - (n-2) - ... - 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`**
