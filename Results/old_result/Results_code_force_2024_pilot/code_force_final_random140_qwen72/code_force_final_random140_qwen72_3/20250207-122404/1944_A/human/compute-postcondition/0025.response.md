The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `reachable_count - 1` from it. Given that `reachable_count` is `n - 2`, the expression `reachable_count - 1` simplifies to `(n - 2) - 1`, which is `n - 3`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - (n - 3)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is now `k - (n - 3)`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 2`**.
