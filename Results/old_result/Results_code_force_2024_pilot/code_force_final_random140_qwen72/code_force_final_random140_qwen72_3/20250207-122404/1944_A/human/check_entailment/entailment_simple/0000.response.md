Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to \( k \) bridges. The key insight is that if \( k \geq n - 1 \), Dominater can isolate Everule on island 1 by destroying all bridges connected to it, thus reducing the number of reachable islands to 1. If \( k < n - 1 \), Dominater cannot isolate Everule completely, and Everule can still visit all \( n \) islands because the remaining bridges will still form a connected graph.

The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:
- If \( k \geq n - 1 \), it returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.
- Otherwise, it returns \( n \), indicating that Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.

This matches the expected behavior for the given problem and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
