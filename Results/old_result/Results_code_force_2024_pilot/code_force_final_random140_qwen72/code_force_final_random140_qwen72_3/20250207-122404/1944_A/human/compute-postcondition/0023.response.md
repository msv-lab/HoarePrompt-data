Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is now `k - (n - 1) + 1` and must be greater than or equal to `2n - 3` and greater than 0, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 2`**

Explanation: The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 1` to `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
