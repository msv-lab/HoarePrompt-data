Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. The key insight is that if Dominater can destroy at least `n-1` bridges, they can isolate island 1 from all other islands, making it impossible for Everule to visit any other island. This is because there are `n-1` bridges directly connecting island 1 to the other `n-1` islands. If fewer than `n-1` bridges are destroyed, Everule can still visit all `n` islands because the remaining bridges will form a connected graph.

The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:
- If `k >= n - 1`, it returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.
- Otherwise, it returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all `n` islands.

This logic aligns with the problem's requirements and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
