The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `reachable_count` is `n - 2`. After decrementing, the new value of `reachable_count` is `n - 3`.

All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - 3n + 6`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `reachable_count` is `n - 3`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `2n - 3` and greater than `n - 1`.**
