Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`. It calculates and prints the number of islands (`reachable_count`) that remain reachable after potentially destroying up to `k` bridges. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases specified initially. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the result for each test case. The final state of the program includes `t` remaining unchanged, `n` and `k` being the last input values from the final test case, and `reachable_count` being 1. **
