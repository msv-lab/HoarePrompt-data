To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `k >= reachable_count - 1`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `k - n + 1`.
   - `reachable_count` is `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes: `k - n + 1 >= (n - 1) - 1`.
   - Simplifying this: `k - n + 1 >= n - 2`.
   - Further simplifying: `k >= 2n - 3`.

2. **Condition 2: `k > 0`**
   - This condition is straightforward: `k` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`k`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must satisfy both conditions:
  - `k >= 2n - 3`
  - `k > 0`

- **`reachable_count`**: The value of `reachable_count` is `n - 1`, and it does not change. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `reachable_count`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to satisfy both conditions. Since `k` is already `k - n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `k - n + 1` meets the conditions.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is now `k - n + 1` and must be greater than or equal to `2n - 3` and greater than 0, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`**
