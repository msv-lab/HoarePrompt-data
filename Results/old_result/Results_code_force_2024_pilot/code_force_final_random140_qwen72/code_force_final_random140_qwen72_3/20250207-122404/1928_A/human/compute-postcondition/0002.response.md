The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` (which were between 1 and 10^9) are replaced by the new values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0.**
