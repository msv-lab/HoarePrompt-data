Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and at least one of `a` or `b` is even. If `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b` is even, and either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a` is even.***
