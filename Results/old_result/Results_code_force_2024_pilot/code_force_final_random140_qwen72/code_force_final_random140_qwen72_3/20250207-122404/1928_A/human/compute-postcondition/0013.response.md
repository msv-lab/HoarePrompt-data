The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies conditions related to `a` and `b`, but these conditions are not checked in the given code snippet. The only change is that `a` and `b` are now assigned specific values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.**
