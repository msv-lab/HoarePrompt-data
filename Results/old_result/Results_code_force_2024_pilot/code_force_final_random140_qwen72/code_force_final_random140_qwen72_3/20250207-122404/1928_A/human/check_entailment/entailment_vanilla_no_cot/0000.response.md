Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program has a logical flaw in its conditions for determining whether Bob can form another rectangle. Specifically, the conditions `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` and `a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` do not fully capture all scenarios where Bob cannot form another rectangle.

Here's a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

1. If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then Bob cannot form another rectangle because cutting an odd-length side results in non-integer dimensions.
2. If either dimension is even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the even side in half and rearranging the pieces.

The correct logic should be:

- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, print "No".
- Otherwise, print "Yes".

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

This corrected program will correctly handle all test cases as described in the problem statement.
