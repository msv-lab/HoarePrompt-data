Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (considering rotations).

### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - **Both Dimensions Odd**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original. Hence, the output is 'NO'.
   - **Special Case**: If one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other dimension is odd, it is also impossible to form a new rectangle. For example, if `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd, the output is 'NO'.
   - **All Other Cases**: In all other cases, it is possible to form a new rectangle, so the output is 'YES'.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Conditions**:
  - **Both Dimensions Odd**: This condition is correct because cutting an odd-by-odd rectangle will always result in smaller rectangles that cannot form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original.
  - **Special Case**: This condition is also correct. If one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other dimension is odd, the resulting smaller rectangles will always form the same shape when reassembled.
  - **All Other Cases**: This condition is correct because any other combination of dimensions will allow for the formation of a new rectangle that is not identical to the original.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `a` or `b` is 1, and when `a` or `b` is even.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a new rectangle can be formed from the given dimensions. The conditions and logic are sound and cover all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
