Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is even.
- Either `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd, or `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement, as it is a static string.

Output: **NO**
