Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
