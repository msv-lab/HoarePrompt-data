Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly identifies some cases where a rectangle cannot be transformed into a different rectangle. 

For example, consider the input `a = 4` and `b = 4`. According to the problem description, a 4x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x4 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 2x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x4 rectangle. However, the program will output "NO" for this case, which is incorrect.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the input `a = 4` and `b = 4`:
1. The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is false because both `a` and `b` are even.
2. The condition `elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0)` is also false because neither `a / 2 == b` nor `b / 2 == a` holds true, and both `a` and `b` are even.
3. Therefore, the program falls into the `else` block and prints "YES".

However, the correct output for this case should be "YES" because a 4x4 rectangle can indeed be transformed into a different rectangle (2x8).

This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and thus, it is incorrect.
