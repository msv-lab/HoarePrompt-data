The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, with each test case involving two positive integers `a` and `b`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so I'll assume the function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case. Each result could be a value derived from `a` and `b` for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a specific operation or calculation involving `a` and `b` for that test case.**
