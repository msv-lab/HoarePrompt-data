Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is even.
- Either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0.
- Either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement directly, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **YES**
