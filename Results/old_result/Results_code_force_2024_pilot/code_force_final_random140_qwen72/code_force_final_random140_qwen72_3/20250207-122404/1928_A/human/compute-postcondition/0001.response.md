To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

- The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(n)` function, starting from 0 by default.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each of the t test cases, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
- `n` is an input integer.

The only variables that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
