### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then recombined to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - The key condition is that the new rectangle must not be a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and thus no new rectangle can be formed.
   - If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - However, we need to ensure that the new rectangle formed is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

3. **Checking the Conditions in the Code:**
   - The code first checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd (`if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints 'NO' because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - Next, it checks if cutting the rectangle results in a new rectangle that is a 90-degree rotation of the original. Specifically, it checks if \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b\) is odd, or if \(b / 2 == a\) and \(a\) is odd. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Verification of the Conditions:**
   - The first condition correctly identifies when both dimensions are odd, ensuring no new rectangle can be formed.
   - The second condition correctly identifies when the new rectangle would be a 90-degree rotation of the original, ensuring that such cases are excluded.
   - The third condition ensures that all other cases where a new rectangle can be formed are correctly identified.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The condition `a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0` and `b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0` should be checked carefully. The use of floating-point division (`/`) might introduce precision issues, but since \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, the division will result in an integer if the condition is met.
   - However, the logical structure of the conditions is correct. The program correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the new rectangle is not a 90-degree rotation of the original.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. The conditions are well-defined and cover all necessary cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
