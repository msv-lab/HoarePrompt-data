The only objects in the loop head are variables `idx` and the list `arrs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `arrs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be incremented by 1, and the list `arrs` must have at least one more element.

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 1, and `arrs` is a list of integers with at least two elements. For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be 2, and `arrs` must have at least three elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least three elements, and `idx` is 2. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is set to 2. If `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, `cnt0` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0.**
