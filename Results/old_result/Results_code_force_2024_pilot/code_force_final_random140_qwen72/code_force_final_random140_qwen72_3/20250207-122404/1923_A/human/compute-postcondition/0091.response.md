Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 if `arrs[0] == 0`, or the count of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0] == 1`, `cnt1` is 0, `ans` remains the same as before, and the first element of `arrs` (`arrs[0]`) is 1.**
