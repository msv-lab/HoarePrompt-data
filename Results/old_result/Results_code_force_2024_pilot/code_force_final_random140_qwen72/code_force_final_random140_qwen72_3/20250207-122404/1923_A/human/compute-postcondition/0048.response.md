The value of `cnt0` is decremented by 1, reflecting one less zero in the list `arrs` (excluding the first element which is 0). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element which is 0) minus 1, and `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`. The first element of `arrs` is 0, and the last element of `arrs` is 0.**
