Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1, `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`, `ans` retains its value based on the conditions described, and `arrs[0]` is 0. If the last element of `arrs` (i.e., `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]`) is 0, then `cnt0` is decremented by 1.***
