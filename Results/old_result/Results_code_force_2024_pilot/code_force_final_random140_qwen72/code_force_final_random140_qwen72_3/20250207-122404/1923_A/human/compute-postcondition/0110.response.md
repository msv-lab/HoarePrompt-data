Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `ans` is `cnt0`, `cnt0` and `cnt1` remain the same as before if `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is not 0, otherwise `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 minus 1, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs` if `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is 0, or `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 if `arrs[0] == 0`, or the count of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0] == 1`, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs` if `arrs[0] != 0`. Additionally, `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1.**
