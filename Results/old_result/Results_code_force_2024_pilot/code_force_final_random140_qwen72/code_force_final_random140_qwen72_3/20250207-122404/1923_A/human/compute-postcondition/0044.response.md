Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0). If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt1` is 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 1, `cnt1` is incremented by 1 to become 2 if `arrs[0]` is 1, or 1 if `arrs[0]` is not 1. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains unchanged.***
