The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `arrs[1]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is set to 1, and `idx` is 1, `cnt0` was initially 1. After the increment, `cnt0` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `idx` is 1, and `cnt0` is 2.**
