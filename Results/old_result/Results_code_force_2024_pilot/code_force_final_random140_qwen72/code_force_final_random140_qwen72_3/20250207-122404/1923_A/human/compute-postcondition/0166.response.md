Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`, and if `arrs[0]` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1, and if the last element of `arrs` (i.e., `arrs[len(arrs) - 1]`) is 0, then `cnt0` is decremented by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 0. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`.**
