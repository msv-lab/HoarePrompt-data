Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

In this case, the correct number of operations is 2 because we need to move the chip at position 4 to position 2, and then the chip at position 5 to position 3. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1. This indicates that the logic for counting the number of operations is flawed.
