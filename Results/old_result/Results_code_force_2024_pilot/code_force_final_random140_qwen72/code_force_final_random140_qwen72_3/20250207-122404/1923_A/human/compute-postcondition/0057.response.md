To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `length` is an input integer.
   - `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements.
   - `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, which means it is the index of the last element in the list `arrs`.
   - `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0).
   - If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decreased by 1.
   - `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`.
   - If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0.
   - If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Counting Zeros (`cnt0`):**
     - `cnt0` is initially the count of zeros in `arrs`, excluding the first element if it is 0.
     - If both the first and last elements of `arrs` are 0, `cnt0` is decreased by 1.
   - **Counting Ones (`cnt1`):**
     - `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`.
   - **Determining `ans`:**
     - If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0.
     - If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on the value of `cnt1`.
   - If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` will be 0.
   - If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` will be the value of `cnt0`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is 0 if cnt1 is 0 or 1, otherwise ans is cnt0, and cnt0 is the count of zeros in arrs, adjusted as described)**
