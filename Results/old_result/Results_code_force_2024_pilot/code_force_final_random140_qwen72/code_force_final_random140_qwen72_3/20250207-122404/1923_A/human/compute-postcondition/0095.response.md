Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 if `arrs[0] == 0`, or the count of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0] == 1`, `cnt1` is 1 + 1 if `arrs[0] == 1`, otherwise `cnt1` is 1, and `ans` remains the same as before.**

Explanation:
- `cnt1` is incremented by 1.
- If `arrs[0] == 1`, then `cnt1` was initially 1, so now `cnt1` is 2.
- If `arrs[0] != 1`, then `cnt1` was initially 0, so now `cnt1` is 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `length`, `arrs`, `idx`, `cnt0`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
