Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 0 unless `arrs[0]` is 0, in which case `cnt0` is 1, `cnt1` is the same as before, `ans` is the same as before, and `arrs[0]` is either 0 or 1.***
