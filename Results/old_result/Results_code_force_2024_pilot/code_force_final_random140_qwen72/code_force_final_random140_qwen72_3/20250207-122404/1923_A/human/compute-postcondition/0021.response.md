The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `cnt0` is set to 1 if `arrs[1]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains 0, the new value of `cnt0` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 2 if it was initially 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `idx` is 1, and `cnt0` is either 1 or 2 depending on the initial condition.**
