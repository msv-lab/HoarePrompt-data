Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `idx` is 2. If `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0`, and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is incremented by 1, making it 3. If `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0` but `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt0` remains 2. If `arrs[0] == 1` and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains the same. `cnt1` and `ans` remain unchanged. The first element of `arrs` is 0 if the condition `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0` is true, otherwise it is either 0 or 1.***
