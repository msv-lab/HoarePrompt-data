The value of `cnt1` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least `length` elements, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the count of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 1, `ans` retains its value based on the conditions described, and `arrs[0]` is 1. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 1.**
