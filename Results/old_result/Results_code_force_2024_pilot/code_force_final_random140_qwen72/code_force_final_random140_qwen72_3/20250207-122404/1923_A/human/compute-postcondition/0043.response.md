The value of `cnt1` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt1` is 1 if `arrs[0]` is 1, and it is incremented by 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 1. Since `idx` is 2, and the code snippet increments `cnt1` by 1, it implies that `arrs[2]` is 1. Therefore, `cnt1` is now 2 if `arrs[0]` was 1, or 1 if `arrs[0]` was not 1 but `arrs[2]` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), `cnt1` is 2 if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1.**
