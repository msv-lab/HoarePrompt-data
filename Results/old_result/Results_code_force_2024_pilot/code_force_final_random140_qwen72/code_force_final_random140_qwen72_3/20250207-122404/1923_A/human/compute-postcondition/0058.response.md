The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0). If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the counts of zeros and ones remain unchanged. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0. If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`.**
