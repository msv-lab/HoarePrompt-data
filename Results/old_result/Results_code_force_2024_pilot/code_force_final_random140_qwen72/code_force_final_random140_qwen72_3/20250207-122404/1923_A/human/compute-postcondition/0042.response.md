The value of `cnt1` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt1` is initially 1 if `arrs[0]` is 1, and it is incremented by 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 1. Since the code snippet `cnt1 += 1` is executed, `cnt1` is incremented by 1 regardless of the current value of `arrs[idx]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), `cnt1` is incremented by 1.**
