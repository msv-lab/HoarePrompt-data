The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a list of integers (0s and 1s) representing cells, with 1s indicating cells containing chips and 0s indicating free cells. The function calculates the minimum number of moves required to group all 1s together into a single contiguous block by moving 1s to the left. The result for each test case is printed to the console. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the results directly.
