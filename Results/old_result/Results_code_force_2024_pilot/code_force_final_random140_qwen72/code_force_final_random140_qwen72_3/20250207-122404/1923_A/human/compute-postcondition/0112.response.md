To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
   - `length` is an input integer.
   - `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements.
   - `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`.
   - `cnt0` and `cnt1` are determined based on the following conditions:
     - If `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `cnt0` and `cnt1` remain unchanged.
     - If `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 minus 1, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`.
     - If `arrs[0] == 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`.

2. **Determine `ans` based on `cnt1`:**
   - If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0.
   - If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`.

3. **Evaluate the conditions:**
   - We need to consider the different cases for `arrs[0]` and the last element of `arrs` to determine the values of `cnt0` and `cnt1`.

### Case Analysis:

#### Case 1: `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is not 0
- `cnt0` and `cnt1` remain unchanged.
- Since `cnt1` is not specified, we cannot determine `ans` precisely without more information.

#### Case 2: `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is 0
- `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 minus 1.
- `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`.
- If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0.
- If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`.

#### Case 3: `arrs[0] == 1`
- `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1.
- `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`.
- If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0.
- If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, the value of `ans` depends on the values of `cnt0` and `cnt1`. Without specific values for `arrs`, we can only describe the output in general terms based on the conditions provided.

Output: **ans (where ans is 0 if cnt1 is 0 or 1, otherwise ans is cnt0, and cnt0 and cnt1 are determined based on the initial conditions described)**
