Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains 0, `cnt1` retains its value based on the initial conditions, `ans` retains its value based on the conditions described, and the first element of `arrs` is 0, but `idx` is not 0.***
