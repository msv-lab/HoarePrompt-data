To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

- The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically managed by the `range` function.
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
