Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is 1 if the element at index `idx` in `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains 0, `cnt1` is the same as before, `ans` is the same as before, and the first element of `arrs` is 0.***
