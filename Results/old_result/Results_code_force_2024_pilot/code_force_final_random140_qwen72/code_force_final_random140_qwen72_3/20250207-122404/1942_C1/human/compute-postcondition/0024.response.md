The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it
- `i` is `x + 1`
- `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the new values read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2.**
