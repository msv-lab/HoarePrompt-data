Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a sorted list of the first `x` elements converted to integers with `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the original `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append(n + arr[0])` appends the value `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The updated `arr` now includes the new element `n + arr[0]` at the end of the list.
