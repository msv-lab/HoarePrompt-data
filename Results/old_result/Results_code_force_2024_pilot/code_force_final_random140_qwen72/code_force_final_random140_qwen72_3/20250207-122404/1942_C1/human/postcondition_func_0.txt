The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` distinct integers. The function processes each test case by sorting the list of integers, appending `n + arr[0]` to the list, and calculating the number of pairs of consecutive elements in the list that have a difference of 2. It then prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves `t` as 0, and the last processed values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `ans` reflect the state of the last test case.
