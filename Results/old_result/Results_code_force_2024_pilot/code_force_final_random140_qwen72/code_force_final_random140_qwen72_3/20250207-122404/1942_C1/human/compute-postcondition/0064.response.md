Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer from the last iteration, `x` is the last second integer from the last iteration, `y` is the last third integer from the last iteration, `arr` is a sorted list of the last `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2 for the last iteration.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` is no longer greater than 0.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
- `arr` will be a sorted list of the last `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it.
- `i` will be `x + 1` after the final iteration, as it is incremented through the loop.
- `ans` will be the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2 for the last iteration.
