To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, x + 1):
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to (but not including) `x + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it
- `ans` is `x - 2`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 1 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it, `ans` is `x - 2`, `i` is 1**
