The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, or `y`. The list `arr` initially contains the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and after sorting, it remains the same list but in sorted order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
