The code snippet `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` = 0
- The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `x` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `y` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The values of `t` and the list of `x` distinct integers remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
