The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `arr`. This replaces the previous value of `arr`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `arr` was initially described as a sorted list of the first `x` elements of the original `arr` converted to integers with `n + arr[0]` appended to it. After executing the code, `arr` now holds a list of strings obtained from the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.**
