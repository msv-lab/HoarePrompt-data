You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

            print(ans)
            
        #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer from the last iteration, `x` is the last second integer from the last iteration, `y` is the last third integer from the last iteration, `arr` is a sorted list of the last `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2 for the last iteration.
    #State: *If the program is executed as the main module, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer from the last iteration, `x` is the last second integer from the last iteration, `y` is the last third integer from the last iteration, `arr` is a sorted list of the last `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2 for the last iteration. If the program is not executed as the main module, the variables remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` distinct integers. The function processes each test case by sorting the list of integers, appending `n + arr[0]` to the list, and calculating the number of pairs of consecutive elements in the list that have a difference of 2. It then prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves `t` as 0, and the last processed values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `ans` reflect the state of the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are not consecutive and the gap between them is more than 2. The logic in the program assumes that the only way to form additional triangles is if the gap between two chosen vertices is exactly 2. However, this is not always the case. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 2 0
1 3
```

In this case, the vertices 1 and 3 are chosen, and the gap between them is 2, which the program correctly identifies and adds an additional triangle. However, if we consider a different input:

```
1
6 2 0
1 4
```

Here, the gap between the chosen vertices 1 and 4 is 3, which means there is a vertex (2 or 3) that can be used to form an additional triangle. The program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly output 0 additional triangles, whereas the correct output should be 1.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
