To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input.
   - `y` is the third integer from the input.
   - `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it.
   - `i` is `x + 1`.
   - `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2.

2. **Constructing `arr`:**
   - `arr` is a list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n + 1`.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 5`, then `arr` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11]`.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `ans` starts with the value `x - 2`.
   - We need to count the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2.
   - For the example `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11]`:
     - Differences: \(2-1=1\), \(3-2=1\), \(4-3=1\), \(5-4=1\), \(11-5=6\).
     - There are no differences of 2 in this example.

4. **General Case:**
   - The list `arr` will always start with the first `x` integers from 1 to `n` and end with `n + 1`.
   - The differences between consecutive elements in the first `x` integers are all 1.
   - The difference between the last element `n` and the appended `n + 1` is 1.
   - Therefore, there will never be any differences of 2 in `arr`.

5. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - Since there are no differences of 2, the number of times the difference is 2 is 0.
   - Therefore, `ans` remains `x - 2`.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is `x - 2`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer from the input)**
