Output State: **t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is currently executing within the main module.**
