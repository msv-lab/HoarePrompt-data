Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with `n` sides, given that Bessie has chosen `x` vertices and you can choose up to `y` additional vertices (in this version, `y = 0`).

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting and Appending**: The program sorts the list of chosen vertices `arr` and appends `n + arr[0]` to the list. This is done to handle the circular nature of the polygon, ensuring that the last vertex connects back to the first.
3. **Initial Answer Calculation**: The initial answer `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a way that forms a convex hull.
4. **Additional Triangles**: The program then iterates through the sorted list to count the number of pairs of consecutive vertices that have a difference of 2. Each such pair can form an additional triangle.
5. **Output**: The final answer is printed for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: For `n = 8`, `x = 4`, and vertices `[1, 6, 2, 5]`, the sorted list is `[1, 2, 5, 6]`. The initial answer is `4 - 2 = 2`. There are no pairs with a difference of 2, so the final answer is `2`.
- **Test Case 2**: For `n = 8`, `x = 8`, and vertices `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`, the sorted list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. The initial answer is `8 - 2 = 6`. There are no pairs with a difference of 2, so the final answer is `6`.
- **Test Case 3**: For `n = 4`, `x = 2`, and vertices `[1, 3]`, the sorted list is `[1, 3]`. The initial answer is `2 - 2 = 0`. There is one pair with a difference of 2, so the final answer is `0 + 2 = 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the test cases, and calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements.
