### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices `arr`.

2. **Sorting and Appending:**
   - The program sorts the list of chosen vertices `arr`.
   - It appends `n + arr[0]` to the end of `arr`. This is done to handle the circular nature of the polygon by effectively "wrapping around" the vertices. This step is crucial for correctly identifying the gaps between the vertices.

3. **Initial Triangle Count:**
   - The initial count of triangles is set to `x - 2`. This is based on the fact that any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with non-intersecting diagonals. This is a correct starting point.

4. **Additional Triangle Count:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks if the difference between consecutive vertices is 2.
   - If the difference is 2, it increments the triangle count `ans` by 1. This accounts for additional triangles that can be formed by adding diagonals between vertices that are two positions apart. This logic is correct for identifying additional triangles.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final count of triangles for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `y = 0` correctly, as specified in the problem statement.
  - It ensures that the vertices are sorted and wraps around the polygon correctly by appending `n + arr[0]`.

- **Logic:**
  - The logic for counting triangles is correct. The initial count `x - 2` is a good starting point, and the additional check for vertices with a difference of 2 correctly identifies additional triangles.

- **Constraints:**
  - The program efficiently handles the constraints, especially the large number of test cases and the large value of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, and the logic for counting triangles is sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
