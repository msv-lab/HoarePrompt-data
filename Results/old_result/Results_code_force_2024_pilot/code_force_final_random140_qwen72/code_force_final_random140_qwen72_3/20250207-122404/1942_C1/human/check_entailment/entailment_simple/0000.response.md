Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and then reads the `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Sorting and Appending**: The program sorts the array of chosen vertices and appends `n + arr[0]` to the end of the array. This is done to handle the circular nature of the polygon, ensuring that the difference between the last and first vertex is considered.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation**: The initial answer is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with non-intersecting diagonals.

4. **Additional Triangles**: The program then iterates through the sorted array to count the number of pairs of consecutive vertices that are exactly 2 units apart. Each such pair can form an additional triangle, so the count is added to the initial answer.

5. **Output**: The final answer is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly. For example, when `x = 2`, the initial answer `x - 2` is 0, which is correct since no triangles can be formed with just 2 vertices.

7. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints, especially since the sorting step is O(x log x) and the subsequent loop is O(x).

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
