The provided code snippet reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, assigning this list to the variable `arr`. This changes the nature of `arr` from a sorted list of integers (as described in the initial state) to a list of strings.

Given the initial state, the only change is to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The new value of `arr` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of strings from the input, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the original `arr` is 2.**
