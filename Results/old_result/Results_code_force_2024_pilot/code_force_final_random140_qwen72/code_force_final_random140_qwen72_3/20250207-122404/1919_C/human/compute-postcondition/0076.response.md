To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `range(1, len(b))` generates a sequence of numbers. This means `len(b)` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b) - 1`).

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
- `a` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is not greater than the next element in `lit` (if any), and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
- `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is greater than the last element in `a` (if any).
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`b`**: For the loop to execute, `len(b)` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `b` must contain at least 2 elements.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` in the loop head is already defined as `i` in `range(1, len(b))`, so it will start from 1 and go up to `len(b) - 1`.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
- `a` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is not greater than the next element in `lit` (if any), and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
- `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is greater than the last element in `a` (if any), and `len(b)` must be greater than 1.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element.
