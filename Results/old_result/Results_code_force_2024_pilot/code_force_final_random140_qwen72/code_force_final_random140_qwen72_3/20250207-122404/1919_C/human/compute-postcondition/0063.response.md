Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is not greater than the next element in `lit` (if any), `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is greater than the last element in `a` (if any), `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The loop runs `n-1` times, so `n` must be greater than 0.
- **`lit`**: Remains unchanged as it is the input list.
- **`a`**: Contains elements from `lit` that are not greater than the next element in `lit`. This means `a` will contain elements in non-decreasing order.
- **`b`**: Contains elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a`. This means `b` will contain elements that are strictly increasing relative to the last element in `a`.
- **`cp`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `len(a) + len(b) - 2` because the loop increments `i` by 1 for each iteration.
- **`s`**: This variable counts the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element. Since `a` and `b` are constructed based on the conditions in the loop, `s` will reflect the number of such occurrences.
