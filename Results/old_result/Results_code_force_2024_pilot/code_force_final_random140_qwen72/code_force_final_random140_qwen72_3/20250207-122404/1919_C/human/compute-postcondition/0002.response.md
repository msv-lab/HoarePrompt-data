The code snippet `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on spaces, converts each part into an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `lit`.

- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- A new variable `lit` is created and assigned a list of integers derived from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
