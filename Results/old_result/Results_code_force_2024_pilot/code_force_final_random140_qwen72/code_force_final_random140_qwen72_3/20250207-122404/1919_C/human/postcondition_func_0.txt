The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case by splitting the list into two sublists: `a` contains the first element and all subsequent elements that are not greater than the last element in `a`, while `b` contains all elements that are greater than the last element in `a`. The function then calculates the total number of increasing pairs within both `a` and `b` and prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
