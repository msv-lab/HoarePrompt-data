The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3. If the last element of `a` (which initially contains the first element of `lit`) is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.**
