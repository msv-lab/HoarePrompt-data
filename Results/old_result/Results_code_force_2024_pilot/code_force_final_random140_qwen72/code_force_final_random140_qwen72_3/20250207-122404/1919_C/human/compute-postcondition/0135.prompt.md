You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the size of the array a, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a, b = [lit[0]], []
        
        cp = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[-1] < lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            else:
                a.append(lit[i])
        
        s = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        
        print(s)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2` for the last iteration, and `s` is the total number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the total number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined inputs within its scope. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the processing of the list `a`. The exact nature of the processing and the returned result is not specified in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
