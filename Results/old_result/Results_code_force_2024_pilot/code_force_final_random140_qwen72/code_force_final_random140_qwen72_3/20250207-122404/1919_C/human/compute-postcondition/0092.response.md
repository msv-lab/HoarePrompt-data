Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `len(a)` is 1, `len(b)` is 0, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, and `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cp = 0` does not change the value of `cp` because it was already 0 in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
