The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 3
- If the last element of `a` (which initially contains the first element of `lit`) is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.

After executing `b.append(lit[i])`:

- The value of `lit[i]` (which is `lit[3]`) is appended to the list `b`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 3
- If the last element of `a` (which initially contains the first element of `lit`) is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second, third, and fourth elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[3]`, then `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second, third, and fourth elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the fourth element of `lit`.**
