Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `b` starting from the second element (index 1) to the second-to-last element (index `len(b) - 2`).
- For each iteration, if the current element `b[i]` is greater than the previous element `b[i - 1]`, the variable `s` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) + len(b) - 2`, which is the final index the loop reaches.
- The value of `s` will be the sum of the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element and the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.
