Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. `b` must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements.***
