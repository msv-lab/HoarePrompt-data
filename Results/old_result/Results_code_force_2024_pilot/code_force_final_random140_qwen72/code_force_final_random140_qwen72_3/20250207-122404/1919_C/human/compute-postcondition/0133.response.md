Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2` for the last iteration, and `s` is the total number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the total number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element across all test cases.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains an integer within the specified range, as it represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is the size of the array `lit` for each test case, which is an input integer greater than 0.
- `lit` is the list of integers derived from the input for each test case.
- `a` is constructed by starting with the first element of `lit` and appending elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element in `a`.
- `b` contains elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` when they are encountered.
- `cp` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is the index used in the inner loops, and for the last iteration, it will be `len(a) + len(b) - 2`.
- `s` is the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element and the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) is greater than its preceding element, accumulated across all test cases.
