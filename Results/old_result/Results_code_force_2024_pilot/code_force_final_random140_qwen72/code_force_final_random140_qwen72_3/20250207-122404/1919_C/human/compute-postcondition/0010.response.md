Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If the last element of `a` (which initially contains the first element of `lit`) is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two elements of `lit`, and `b` remains an empty list.***
