Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `len(a)` is 1, `len(b)` is 0, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2` which simplifies to -1, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element, which remains 0 since both lists have fewer than 2 elements.**
