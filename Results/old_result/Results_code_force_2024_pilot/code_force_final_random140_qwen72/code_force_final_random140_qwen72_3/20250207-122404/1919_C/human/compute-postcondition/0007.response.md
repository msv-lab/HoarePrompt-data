The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `b` was initially an empty list. After the code executes, `b` contains the element at index `i` of `lit`.
- `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 of `lit` is appended to `b`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`.**
