Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the previous element in `a`, `len(a)` is the number of elements in `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the previous element in `a`, `len(b)` is the number of elements in `b`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the previous element in `a`, `len(a)` is the number of elements in `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the previous element in `a`, `len(b)` must be greater than 1, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the previous element in `a`, `len(a)` is the number of elements in `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the previous element in `a`, `len(b)` must be greater than 2, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the previous element in `a`, `len(a)` is the number of elements in `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the previous element in `a`, `len(b)` must be greater than 3, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
