Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `len(a)` is 1, `len(b)` is 0, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is 0, and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit`.**
