The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`.

- Initially, `b` is a list containing the last element of `lit` or is empty.
- After executing the code, `b` will contain the last element of `lit` (if it was already present) and the element at index `i` of `lit`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than 2
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly the element at index `i` of `lit`
- `b` is either a list containing the last element of `lit` or remains empty
- `len(a)` is 2
- `len(b)` is 1 if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit`, otherwise `len(b)` is 0
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `s` is 0
- The last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[i]`, otherwise the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit`

After executing the code:
- `b` now contains the last element of `lit` (if it was already present) and the element at index `i` of `lit`.
- The length of `b` is now 1 or 2, depending on whether `b` initially contained the last element of `lit`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the last element of `lit` and the element at index `i` of `lit`, `len(a)` is 2, `len(b)` is 1 or 2, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[i]`, otherwise the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit`.**
