The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, assigning this list to the variable `lit`. This operation updates the value of `lit` based on the user input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`
- `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element

After executing the code snippet:
- `lit` is updated to a new list of integers derived from the input.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged because they are not directly modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.**
