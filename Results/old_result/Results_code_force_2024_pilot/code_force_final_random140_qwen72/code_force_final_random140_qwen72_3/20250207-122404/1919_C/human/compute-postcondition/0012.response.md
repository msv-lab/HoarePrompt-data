Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of the list `lit` to the list `b`.
- Initially, `b` was a list containing the second element of `lit`.
- After executing the code, `b` now contains both the second and third elements of `lit`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
