Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than `len(a) + len(b) - 1`, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly `lit[i]`, `b` is either a list containing the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b)`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element. If the last element of `a` is less than `lit[i]`, then `b` contains `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `a` contains `lit[i]` and `b` remains empty.***
