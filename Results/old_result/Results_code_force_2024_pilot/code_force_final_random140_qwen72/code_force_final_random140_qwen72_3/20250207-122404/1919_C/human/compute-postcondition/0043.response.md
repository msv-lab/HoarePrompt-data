To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`.
- `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` Construction**:
   - `a` starts with the first element of `lit`.
   - Subsequent elements of `a` are added only if they are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`.

2. **List `b` Construction**:
   - `b` contains elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered.
   - `b` must have at least 2 elements.

3. **Variable `s` Calculation**:
   - `s` is the sum of two counts:
     - The number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element.
     - The number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.

### Detailed Calculation:
- **Count for `a`**:
  - Since `a` is constructed such that no element is greater than any preceding element, the count of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element is 0.

- **Count for `b`**:
  - `b` contains elements that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered.
  - The first element of `b` is not considered in the count.
  - The count is the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.

### Final Value of `s`:
- Since the count for `a` is 0, `s` is solely determined by the count for `b`.
- The count for `b` is the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.

### Conclusion:
The `print(s)` statement will print the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.

Output: **s (where s is the number of times an element in b (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element)**
