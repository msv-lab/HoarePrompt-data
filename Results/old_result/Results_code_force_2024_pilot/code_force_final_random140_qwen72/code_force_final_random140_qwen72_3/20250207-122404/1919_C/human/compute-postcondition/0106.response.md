The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `a` initially contains the first element of `lit` and possibly the element at index `i` of `lit`. After appending `lit[i]`, `a` will contain three elements: the first element of `lit`, the element at index `i` (which was already in `a`), and the element at index `i` again.
- The length of `a` increases from 2 to 3.
- The value of `lit[i]` is appended to `a`, which means `a[-1]` (the last element of `a`) is now `lit[i]`.
- The conditions regarding `b` and the comparison between `a[-1]` and `lit[i]` remain unchanged because `a[-1]` is now `lit[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, the element at index `i` of `lit`, and the element at index `i` of `lit` again, `b` is either a list containing the last element of `lit` or remains empty, `len(a)` is 3, `len(b)` is 1 if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit`, otherwise `len(b)` is 0, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[i]`, otherwise the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit`.**
