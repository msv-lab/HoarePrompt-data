To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input
- `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`
- `b` is an empty list
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to but not including `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- The variable `i` is used as the loop counter, and it will take values from 1 to `n-1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `i` is not relevant to the loop head, as it will be set by the `range` function during each iteration.

### Final State:
Since the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution is `n`, and it must be greater than 1, the state should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.**
