Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic used to split the array `lit` into `a` and `b`. The program's current approach of appending elements to `b` if they are greater than the last element in `a` does not ensure the optimal partitioning to minimize the penalty. The provided counterexample clearly demonstrates that the program fails to achieve the minimum possible penalty in certain cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
