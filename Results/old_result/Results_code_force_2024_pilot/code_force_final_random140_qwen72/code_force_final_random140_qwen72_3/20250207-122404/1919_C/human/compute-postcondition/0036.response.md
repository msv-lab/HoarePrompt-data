To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`.
- `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of `b` starting from 1 up to `len(b) - 1`.
- The variable `i` is the loop index, which is adjusted by the loop itself.
- The length of `b` (`len(b)`) must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`.
- `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- The loop index `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The length of `b` (`len(b)`) must be greater than the current value of `i` for the loop to continue executing.

### New State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `lit` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `cp` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `s` remains the same unless the condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` is met during the loop execution.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a)`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.**
