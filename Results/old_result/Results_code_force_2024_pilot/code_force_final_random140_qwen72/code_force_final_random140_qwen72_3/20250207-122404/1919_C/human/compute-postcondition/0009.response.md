The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- `lit` remains a list of integers derived from the input.
- `a` initially contains the first element of `lit`. After executing the code, `a` now contains the first element of `lit` and the element at index `i` (which is 1) of `lit`.
- `b` remains an empty list.
- `cp` remains 0.
- `i` remains 1.
- The last element of `a` is now `lit[1]`, which is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` (since `i` is 1).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first two elements of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`.**
