Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cp` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of these variables along with the new value of `cp`.
