Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the last element of `lit`, `len(a)` is 1, `len(b)` is 1, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is 0, and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `-1` (the last element) of `lit` to the list `b`.
- Initially, `b` was an empty list (`len(b)` is 0).
- After appending, `b` now contains one element, which is the last element of `lit` (`len(b)` is 1).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
