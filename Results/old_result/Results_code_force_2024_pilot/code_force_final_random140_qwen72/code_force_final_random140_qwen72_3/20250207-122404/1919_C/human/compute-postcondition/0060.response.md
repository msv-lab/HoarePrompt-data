The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than `len(a) + len(b) - 1`
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly `lit[i]`
- `b` is either a list containing the element at index `i` of `lit` or an empty list
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `len(a) + len(b)`
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element
- If the last element of `a` is less than `lit[i]`, then `b` contains `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `a` contains `lit[i]` and `b` remains empty.

After executing the code snippet `b.append(lit[i])`:
- The list `b` now includes the element `lit[i]`.
- The length of `b` increases by 1.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged because it is not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than `len(a) + len(b) - 1`, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly `lit[i]`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b)`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.**
