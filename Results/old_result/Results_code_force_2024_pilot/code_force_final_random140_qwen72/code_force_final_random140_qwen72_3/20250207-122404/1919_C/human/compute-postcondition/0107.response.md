Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and the element at index `i` of `lit`. If `a[-1] < lit[i]`, `b` is a list containing the last element of `lit` and the element at index `i` of `lit`, and `len(b)` is 2. Otherwise, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, the element at index `i` of `lit`, and the element at index `i` of `lit` again, and `b` is either a list containing the last element of `lit` or remains empty, with `len(b)` being 1 if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit`, otherwise `len(b)` is 0. `len(a)` is 2 if `a[-1] < lit[i]` and 3 otherwise. `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[i]`, otherwise the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit`.***
