Output State: **All other variables remain unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `a`. `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.** 

Explanation: The value of `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means that `required_mod_x` is the smallest non-negative integer that, when added to `mod_x`, results in a multiple of `x`. The other variables (`num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`) remain unchanged.
