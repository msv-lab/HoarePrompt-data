Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `results` contains the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`. The dictionary `freq` for each test case will contain the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for every element in the array `a`, where `mod_x` is the remainder when the element is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder when the element is divided by `y`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`) retain their initial values or are reset for each new test case.**
