Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the parameters `(n, x, y)` and the array `a` for each test case. It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases`. This is appropriate as it processes each test case individually.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**: Inside `func_1`, a `defaultdict` named `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is `num % x` and `mod_y` is `num % y`. This is a good approach to efficiently count the occurrences of specific remainders.

4. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair beautiful.
   - If the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

5. **Output**: The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including large values of `n` and multiple test cases.
   - It correctly handles the case where no beautiful pairs exist (e.g., the second test case in the example).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
