The code snippet `a = case['array']` assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `case` is the first element of `test_cases`, which is a tuple `(n, x, y)`. However, the structure of `case` suggests that it might be a dictionary with an 'array' key, which is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Assuming `case` is indeed a dictionary with an 'array' key, the value of `a` will be the array associated with this key.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `case['array']`, we cannot determine the specific value of `a`. However, we can state that `a` now holds the value of `case['array']`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, x, y) where each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `case` is the first element of `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`.**
