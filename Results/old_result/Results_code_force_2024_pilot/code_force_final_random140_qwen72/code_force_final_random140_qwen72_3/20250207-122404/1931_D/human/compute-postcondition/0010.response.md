The provided code snippet assigns the value of `mod_y` to the variable `required_mod_y`. Since `mod_y` is not defined in the initial state, it's assumed to be a typo or missing definition. However, based on the context, it seems like `mod_y` should be `y`.

Let's go through the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, x, y) where each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
   - `case` is the first element of `test_cases`.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `a` is the value of `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
   - `freq` is an empty defaultdict with default type int.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - (x % y)) % x`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` is executed. Assuming `mod_y` should be `y`, `required_mod_y` is assigned the value of `y`.

3. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `required_mod_y` is now equal to `y`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, x, y) where each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `case` is the first element of `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty defaultdict with default type int, `beautiful_count` is 0, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (x % y)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `y`.**
