Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0 or 1, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value `2`, `results` now includes the final value of `beautiful_count` for the current test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list from `case['array']` that must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y` is the new result of `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` updates the value of `required_mod_x`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which means it is the remainder when `x - mod_x` is divided by `x`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
