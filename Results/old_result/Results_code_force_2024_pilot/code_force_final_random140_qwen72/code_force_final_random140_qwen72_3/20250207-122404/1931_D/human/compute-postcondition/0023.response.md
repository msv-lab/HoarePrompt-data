Output State: **All other variables remain unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `a`. `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`. `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**
