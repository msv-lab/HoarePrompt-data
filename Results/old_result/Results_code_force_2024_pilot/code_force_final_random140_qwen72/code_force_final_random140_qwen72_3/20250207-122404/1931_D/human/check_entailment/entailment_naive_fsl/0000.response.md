Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary**: A `defaultdict` named `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num % x` and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.

3. **Beautiful Pair Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, the program calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` such that:
     - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `required_mod_y = mod_y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

4. **Output**: The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and prints the results.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that it works correctly for every potential input. Therefore, the program is correct.
