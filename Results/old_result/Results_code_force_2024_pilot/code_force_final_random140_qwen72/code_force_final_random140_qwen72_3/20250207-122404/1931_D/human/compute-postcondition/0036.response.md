Output State: **`beautiful_count` will contain the total count of pairs `(i, j)` for the next test case, `freq` will contain the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for the next test case, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`.
- All other variables (`beautiful_count`, `freq`, `results`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
