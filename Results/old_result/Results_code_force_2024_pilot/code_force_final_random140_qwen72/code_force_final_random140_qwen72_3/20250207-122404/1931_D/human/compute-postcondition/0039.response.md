The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in `a` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is initialized as an empty defaultdict with default value 0, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element in `a`**
