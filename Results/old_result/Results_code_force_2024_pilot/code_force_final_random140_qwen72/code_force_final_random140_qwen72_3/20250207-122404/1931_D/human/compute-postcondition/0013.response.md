Postcondition: ***All other variables remain unchanged. `required_mod_y` is now equal to `y`. If the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is present in the dictionary `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `beautiful_count`.***
