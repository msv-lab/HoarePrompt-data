To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, x, y) where each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
- `case` is the first element of `test_cases`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the value of `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
- `freq` is an empty defaultdict with default type int.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
```

### Analysis:
- The code calculates the value of `required_mod_x` using the formula `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- The variable `mod_x` is not defined in the initial state, which means it must be a previously defined variable or a typo. Assuming `mod_x` is a typo and should be `x % y` (a common operation in similar problems), we can proceed with the calculation.

### Calculation:
- Let's assume `mod_x` is indeed `x % y`.
- The value of `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - (x % y)) % x`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `required_mod_x` is the only new variable introduced by the code.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, x, y) where each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
- `case` is the first element of `test_cases`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the value of `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
- `freq` is an empty defaultdict with default type int.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - (x % y)) % x`.
