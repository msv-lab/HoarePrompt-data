Output State: **The program returns the list `results` which contains the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`.**
