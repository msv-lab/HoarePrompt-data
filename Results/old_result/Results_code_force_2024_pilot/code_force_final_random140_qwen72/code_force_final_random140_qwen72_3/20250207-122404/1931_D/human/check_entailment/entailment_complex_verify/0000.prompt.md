You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `results` contains the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`. The dictionary `freq` for each test case will contain the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for every element in the array `a`, where `mod_x` is the remainder when the element is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder when the element is divided by `y`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`) retain their initial values or are reset for each new test case.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results` which contains the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a dictionary containing a tuple `('params')` with three integers `(n, x, y)` and a list `('array')` of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the count of pairs `(i, j)` in the respective array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`. The original input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary**: A `defaultdict` named `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num % x` and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.

3. **Beautiful Pair Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, the program calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` such that:
     - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `required_mod_y = mod_y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

4. **Output**: The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and prints the results.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that it works correctly for every potential input. Therefore, the program is correct.
