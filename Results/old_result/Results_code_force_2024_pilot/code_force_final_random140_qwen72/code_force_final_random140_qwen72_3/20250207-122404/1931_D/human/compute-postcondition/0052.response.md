Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is updated with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is the new value of `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. Since `mod_y` was already calculated as `num % y`, `required_mod_y` now holds the same value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
