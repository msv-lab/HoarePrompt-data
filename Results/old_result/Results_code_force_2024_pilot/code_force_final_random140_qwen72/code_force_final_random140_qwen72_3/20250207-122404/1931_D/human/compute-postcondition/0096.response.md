Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `beautiful_count` will be the total count of numbers in `a` that can form a "beautiful pair" with any previous number in `a` based on the conditions `(num % x, num % y)`. The `freq` dictionary will contain the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the list `a`. The `results` list will include the final value of `beautiful_count` for the current test case appended to it. The `test_cases` list must still have at least one more element, and `case` will be the next element in `test_cases`. The `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` variables will retain their initial values, and `num` will be the last element processed from `a`.**

To break it down further:
- `beautiful_count`: This will be the total number of "beautiful pairs" found in the list `a`.
- `freq`: This will be a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the remainder when each element in `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and the value is the count of how many times this pair has been encountered.
- `results`: This will include the final value of `beautiful_count` for the current test case.
- `test_cases`: This list must still have at least one more element, and `case` will be the next element in `test_cases`.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`: These will retain their initial values.
- `num`: This will be the last element processed from `a`.
