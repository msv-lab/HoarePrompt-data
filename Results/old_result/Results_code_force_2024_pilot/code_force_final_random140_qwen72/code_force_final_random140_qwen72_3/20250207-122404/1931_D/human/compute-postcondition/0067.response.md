Output State: **`beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `a[j] + k * x == a[i] + l * y` for some integers `k` and `l`. `freq` is a dictionary where each key `(mod_x, mod_y)` represents the frequency of numbers in `a` that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. `results` now includes the final value of `beautiful_count` for the current test case appended to it. `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list from `case['params'][3]` and is ready to be iterated over, and `num` is undefined as the iteration over `a` has not started yet.**
