Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `beautiful_count` will contain the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`. The dictionary `freq` will contain the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for every element in the array `a`, where `mod_x` is the remainder when the element is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder when the element is divided by `y`. The list `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` appended to it. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged.**
