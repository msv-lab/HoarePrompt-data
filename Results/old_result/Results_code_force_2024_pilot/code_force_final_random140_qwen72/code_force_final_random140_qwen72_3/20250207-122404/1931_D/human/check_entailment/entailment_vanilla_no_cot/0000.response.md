Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. The solution uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`, which allows it to efficiently count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions for being beautiful. The approach is efficient and handles the constraints specified in the problem description.
