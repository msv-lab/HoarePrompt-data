The value of `k` is updated to `2 * k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `k` was initially an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n/2), after the operation, `k` will be an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**
