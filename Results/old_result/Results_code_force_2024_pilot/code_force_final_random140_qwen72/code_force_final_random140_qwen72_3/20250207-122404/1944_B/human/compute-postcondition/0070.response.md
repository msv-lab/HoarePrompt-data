Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` remains unchanged, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends `c[i]` to `ans2`. Since `i` is 3, `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`. The initial state already mentioned that `ans2` includes the element `c[3]`, so after appending `c[3]` again, `ans2` now includes two instances of `c[3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
