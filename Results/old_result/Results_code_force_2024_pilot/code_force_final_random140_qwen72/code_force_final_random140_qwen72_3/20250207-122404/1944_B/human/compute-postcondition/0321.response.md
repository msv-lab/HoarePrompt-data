To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `rdb` must contain at least one element
- `sz` is either 0 or 2
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list
- `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process
- If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is 2 and `(2 * k - 2) < 2`, implying that `k` is at least 1. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `(2 * k - sz) < 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`, which means the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `rdb`.

Since `rdb` must contain at least one element at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must still contain at least one element. The variable `elem` will be set to the next element in `rdb`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 0 or 2, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process. If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is 2 and `(2 * k - 2) < 2`, implying that `k` is at least 1. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `(2 * k - sz) < 2`.** 

However, since `elem` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, and it will be set to the next element in `rdb`, the specific value of `elem` is not explicitly stated but is implied by the next element in `rdb`.

Thus, the final state can be simplified to:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 0 or 2, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process.**
