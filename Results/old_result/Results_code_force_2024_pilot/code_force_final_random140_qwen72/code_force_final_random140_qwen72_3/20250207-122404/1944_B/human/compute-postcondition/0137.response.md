Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of duplicates added to `ans1`, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not consecutive duplicates, the loop has completed all iterations, and the last element of `b` (`b[n-1]`) is not in `ans1`.**
