Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `l` is a non-empty list containing at least 3 elements, `ans1` now contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`, `ans2` now contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
