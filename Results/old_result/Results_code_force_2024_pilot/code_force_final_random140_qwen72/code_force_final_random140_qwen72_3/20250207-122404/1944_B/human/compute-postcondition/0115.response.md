Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i - 1]` is not in the list `ans1`, `l` now contains `b[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`.
- Since `i` is 1, `b[i - 1]` is `b[0]`.
- Therefore, `l` now contains the value of `b[0]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
