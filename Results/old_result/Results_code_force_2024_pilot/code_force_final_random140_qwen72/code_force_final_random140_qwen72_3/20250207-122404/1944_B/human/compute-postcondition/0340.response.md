Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is the maximum even number such that `2 * k - (sz + 1) >= 2` holds true, or `sz` is the last value before the condition fails. `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least one element left to process, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
