Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(l)` is greater than 2, `ans1` contains the first element of `l`, the second element of `l`, and the third element of `l`, `ans2` contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
