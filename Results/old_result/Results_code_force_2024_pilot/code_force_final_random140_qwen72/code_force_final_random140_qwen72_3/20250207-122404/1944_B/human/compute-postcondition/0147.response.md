Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`.** 

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[1]` since `i` is 1) to the list `ans2`. Since `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` now contains two elements, both of which are equal to `c[1]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
