To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is the index of the last element processed in `l`, which is `len(l) - 1`.
   - `ans1` contains all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0.
   - `ans2` contains all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0.
   - `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `k` is 2 times its original input value minus the total reduction due to the loop.
   - `l` is a non-empty list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated.
   - If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, then the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is included in `l`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Since `ans1` and `ans2` both contain elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0, they should be identical.
   - The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of `ans2` separated by spaces.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The elements printed will be the same as those in `ans1`, which are the elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0.

Given this analysis, the output of the `print(*ans2)` statement will be the elements of `ans2` separated by spaces.

Output: **elements of ans2 (where ans2 contains all elements from l that were processed before k reached 0)**
