Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is 0, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `sz` to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
