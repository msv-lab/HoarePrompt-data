The code `ans1.append(b[i])` adds the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, the value being added to `ans1` is the same as the value at `b[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing the value of `b[i]` (which is also the value of `b[i - 1]`), `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `req` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
