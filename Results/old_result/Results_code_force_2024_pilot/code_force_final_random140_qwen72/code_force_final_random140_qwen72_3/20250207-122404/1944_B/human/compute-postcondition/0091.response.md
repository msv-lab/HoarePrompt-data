Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `len(l) - 1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
- `ans1` contains all elements of `l`.
- `ans2` also contains all elements of `l`.
- `k` is 0 if it reached 0 during the loop execution.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `l` remain unchanged.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(*ans1)
```

This statement will print all elements of the list `ans1`, separated by spaces. Since `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, the output will be the elements of `l` printed in the same order.

Output: **elements of l (where elements of l are the elements of the list l)**

For example, if `l` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
