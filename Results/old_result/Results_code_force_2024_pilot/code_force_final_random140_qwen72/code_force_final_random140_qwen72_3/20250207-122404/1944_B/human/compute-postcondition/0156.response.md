Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` initially contains the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`. If `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[2]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` is 0, the program continues normally. If `k` is -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[2]` is not equal to `c[1]`, `ans2` remains unchanged.***
