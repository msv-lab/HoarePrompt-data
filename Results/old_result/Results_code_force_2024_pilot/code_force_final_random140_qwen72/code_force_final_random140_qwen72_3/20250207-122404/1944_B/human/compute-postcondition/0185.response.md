Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `q` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variables `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, which are converted to integers.
