Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is -4 unless `c[3] == c[2]`, in which case `k` is -6. `ans2` may include an additional element if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`. If `c[3] == c[2]`, `ans2` includes `c[3]` appended twice. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
