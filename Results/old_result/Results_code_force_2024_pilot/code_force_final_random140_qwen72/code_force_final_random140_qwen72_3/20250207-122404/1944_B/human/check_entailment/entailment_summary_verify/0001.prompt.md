You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, and an array `a`. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array divided by 2, `k` is an integer, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function splits the array `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`, sorts both halves, and then selects pairs of identical elements from these halves to form two new lists, `ans1` and `ans2`. It ensures that the total number of selected pairs is equal to `2 * k`. If there are not enough pairs in `b` or `c`, it uses additional elements from a list `l` that contains unique elements from `b` not already in `ans1`. The function prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, and `req` unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Array Splitting**: The array `a` is split into two halves, `b` and `c`, where `b` contains the first half of `a` and `c` contains the second half. This is done using slicing: `b = a[:n]` and `c = a[n:]`.

3. **Sorting**: Both `b` and `c` are sorted. Sorting helps in easily finding pairs of identical elements, which is crucial for forming the subsets `l` and `r`.

4. **Forming Subsets**:
   - The function initializes `ans1` and `ans2` as empty lists to store the subsets.
   - It uses a variable `k` to keep track of the number of elements needed for each subset. Initially, `k` is set to `2 * k` because each subset should have `2k` elements.
   - The function iterates through the sorted array `b` to find pairs of identical elements. When a pair is found, both elements are added to `ans1`, and `k` is decremented by 2.
   - If a pair is not found, the element is added to a temporary list `l` for later use.
   - The same process is repeated for the sorted array `c` to form `ans2`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing `b` and `c`, if there are still elements needed to complete the subsets, the function uses the elements stored in `l` to fill the remaining spots in `ans1` and `ans2`.

6. **Output**: The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that the input is always valid and that the required pairs will always be found. However, it does not handle edge cases where the input might be invalid or the required pairs might not be found.
- **Efficiency**: The function sorts the arrays `b` and `c`, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\). This is efficient enough given the constraints, but it could be optimized further if needed.
- **Redundant Checks**: The function checks if an element is already in `ans1` before adding it to `l`. This check is redundant because the elements are added to `l` only if they are not part of a pair in `b`.

### Conclusion:
Despite the potential issues mentioned, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output as required and forms the subsets `l` and `r` with the correct properties.

Correctness: **True**
