Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` (which is also `c[0]`), and `ans2` now includes an additional element which is `c[1]` (or equivalently `c[0]`).**
