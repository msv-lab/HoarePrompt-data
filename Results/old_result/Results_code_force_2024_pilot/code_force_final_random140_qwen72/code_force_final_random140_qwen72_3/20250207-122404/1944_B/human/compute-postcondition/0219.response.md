Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans1` contains the values of `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` if they are equal, or contains only `b[i]` if they were not equal initially, and now also contains `b[2]` if `b[i] == b[i-1]`. `ans2` is an empty list. `k` is -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i-1]` otherwise `k` is -2. `q` is `t`. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order. `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order. `req` is 0. `l` is an empty list if `b[i]` equals `b[i-1]` or contains the element `b[0]` if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i-1]`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` is updated to contain the element `b[i-1]` or contains the element `b[0]` and `b[i-1]` if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i-1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
