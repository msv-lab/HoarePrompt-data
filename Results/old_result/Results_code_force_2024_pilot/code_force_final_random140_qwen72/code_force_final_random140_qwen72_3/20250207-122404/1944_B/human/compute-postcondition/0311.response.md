Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus the number of elements printed during the loop execution. If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`. `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process.**
