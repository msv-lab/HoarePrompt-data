Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts separated by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.
- The values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, `q`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
- The new variable `a` is now a list of integers based on the user's input.
