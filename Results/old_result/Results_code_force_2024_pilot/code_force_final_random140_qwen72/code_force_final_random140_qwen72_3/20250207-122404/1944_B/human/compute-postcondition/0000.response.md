The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through the `input()` function. The constraints for `t` remain the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and the conditions for `n`, `k`, and the array `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n/2), and the array `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in `a`.**
