Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is 2, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process. Additionally, the condition `(2 * k - sz >= 2)` is now false, as `2 * k - 2` is less than 2, implying that `k` is at least 1.**
