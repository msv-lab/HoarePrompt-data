To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- `sz` is the maximum even number such that `2 * k - sz >= 2` holds true, or `sz` is the last value before the condition fails.
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged.
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
- `sng` must have at least one element left to process.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.
- The variable `elem` is described as the next element in the list `sng`.

### Explanation:
- Since `sng` is a list with at least one element left to process, `elem` will be the next element in this list.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the next element in the list `sng`, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the list sng)**
