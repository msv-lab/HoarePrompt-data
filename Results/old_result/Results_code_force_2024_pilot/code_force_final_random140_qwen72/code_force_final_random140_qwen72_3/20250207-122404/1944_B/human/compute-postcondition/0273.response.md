To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications of the loop:

### Initial State:
- `i` is the index of the last element processed in `l`, which is `len(l) - 1`.
- `ans1` contains all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0.
- `ans2` contains all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0.
- `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `k` is 2 times its original input value minus the total reduction due to the loop.
- `l` is a non-empty list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, then the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is included in `l`.

### Analysis:
1. **`ans1` and `ans2`**: Both `ans1` and `ans2` contain the same elements, which are all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0. This means that `ans1` and `ans2` are identical lists.
2. **`k`**: The value of `k` is either 0 (if it was reduced to 0 during the loop) or 2 times its original value minus the total reduction due to the loop. However, this does not affect the content of `ans1`.
3. **`l`**: `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated. If the last element of `b` is not in `ans1`, it is included in `l`.

### What is printed:
The `print(*ans1)` statement will print all elements in the list `ans1`, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **elements of ans1 (where ans1 contains all elements from l that were processed before k reached 0)**

This output describes the elements that will be printed, which are the elements in `ans1`. Since the exact elements of `ans1` depend on the specific values of `b` and the initial value of `k`, the output is described in terms of the conditions given in the initial state.
