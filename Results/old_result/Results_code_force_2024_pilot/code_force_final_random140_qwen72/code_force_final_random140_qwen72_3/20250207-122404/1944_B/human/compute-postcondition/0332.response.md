To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `sng`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `rdb` must contain at least one element
- `sz` is the maximum even number such that `2 * k - sz >= 2` holds true, or `sz` is the last value before the condition fails
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list
- `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process

For the loop to execute, `sng` must have at least one element left to iterate over. Since the current state indicates that `sng` has been fully iterated over, we need to adjust the state of `sng` to ensure it has at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `sng` must have at least one element left to process
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`

All other states remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is the maximum even number such that `2 * k - sz >= 2` holds true, or `sz` is the last value before the condition fails, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least one element left to process, `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
