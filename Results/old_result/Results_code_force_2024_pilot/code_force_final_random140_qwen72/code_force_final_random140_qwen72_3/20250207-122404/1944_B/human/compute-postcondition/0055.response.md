Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[0]` and `c[1]`.** 

The code appends the value of `c[i]` to `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, `c[1]` is appended to `ans2`. Given that `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` now includes both the value of `c[0]` and `c[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
