Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is the maximum even number such that `2 * k - sz >= 2` holds true, or `sz` is the last value before the condition fails, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `sz` will be the maximum even number such that the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` holds true, or it will be the last value before the condition fails. The loop will stop either because `sz` has reached or exceeded `2 * k`, or because all elements in `sng` have been processed. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `rdb`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_`, `ldb`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `sng` will have no more elements left to process.
