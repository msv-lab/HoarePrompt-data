To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged.
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
- `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing two instances of the variable `elem` with a space in between and no newline at the end (`end=' '`).
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `sng` has been fully iterated over, it suggests that `elem` might have been the last element processed from `sng`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `sng` has been fully iterated over, `elem` would be the last element that was processed from `sng`.
- Without knowing the exact value of `elem`, we can only describe it as the last element from `sng`.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the last element processed from sng)**
