Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `b[3] == b[2]`, `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans1` now contains the element at index 3 of `b` appended to its previous content. If `b[3] != b[2]` and `b[2]` is not in `ans1`, `l` includes the element `b[2]`. If `k` is 0 at any point, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
