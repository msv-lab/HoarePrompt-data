Output State: **`i` is `len(l)-1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
