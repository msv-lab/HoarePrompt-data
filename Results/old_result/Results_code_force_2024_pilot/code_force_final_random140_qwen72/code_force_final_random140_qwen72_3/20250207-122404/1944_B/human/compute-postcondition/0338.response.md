The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the list `sng`. The loop can execute again if there is at least one more element left in `sng` to be processed. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` was the next element in `sng`, and `sng` had at least one element left to process. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one element left to process, and `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is the maximum even number such that `2 * k - (sz + 1) >= 2` holds true, or `sz` is the last value before the condition fails. `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least one element left to process, `elem` is the next element in `sng`.**
