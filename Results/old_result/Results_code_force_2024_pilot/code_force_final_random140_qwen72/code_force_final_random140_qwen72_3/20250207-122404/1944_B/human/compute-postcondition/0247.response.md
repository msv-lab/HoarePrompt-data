Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is -4. If `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `ans2` now includes an additional element which is `c[2]`. If `k` is 0, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` (which is also `c[0]`). The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
