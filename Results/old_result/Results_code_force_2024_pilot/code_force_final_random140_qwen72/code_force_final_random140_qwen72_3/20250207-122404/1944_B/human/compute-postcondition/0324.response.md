Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 0 or 2, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` has been fully iterated over, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
