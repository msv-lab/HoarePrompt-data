Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element.
   - `sz` is either 2 or 4 depending on whether `2 * k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2.
   - `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list with at least 3 elements.
   - `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is explicitly defined as the third element in the list `ldb`.
   - Since `ldb` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `elem` will always have a well-defined value.
   - The `print` statement will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `elem` repeated twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **elem elem ** (where `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`)
