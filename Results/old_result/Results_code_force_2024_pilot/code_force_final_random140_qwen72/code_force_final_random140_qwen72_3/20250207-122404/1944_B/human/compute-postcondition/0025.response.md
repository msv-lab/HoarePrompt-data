Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the second smallest element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is either an empty list or contains the element `b[0]`, and `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the second smallest element of `b` twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the element `b[0]`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.***
