You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is the index of the last element processed in `l` (which is `len(l) - 1`), `ans1` contains all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0, `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `k` is 2 times its original input value minus the total reduction due to the loop, `l` is a non-empty list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, then the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is included in `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, and `req` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, and an array `a`. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array divided by 2, `k` is an integer, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function splits the array `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`, sorts both halves, and then selects pairs of identical elements from these halves to form two new lists, `ans1` and `ans2`. It ensures that the total number of selected pairs is equal to `2 * k`. If there are not enough pairs in `b` or `c`, it uses additional elements from a list `l` that contains unique elements from `b` not already in `ans1`. The function prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, and `req` unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Handling of Duplicates**: The code attempts to handle duplicates by checking if `b[i] == b[i - 1]` and `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks consecutive elements, which might miss pairs of duplicates that are not adjacent after sorting. For example, if `b = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, the code will only consider the first pair of `2`s and miss the second pair.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Remaining Elements**: The code uses a list `l` to store elements that are not yet used in `ans1`. However, it does not ensure that these elements are correctly paired between `ans1` and `ans2`. This can lead to situations where the final `ans1` and `ans2` do not have the required length `2k` or do not satisfy the XOR condition.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `n` is small and `k` is large, the code might not be able to find enough pairs to fill `ans1` and `ans2` to the required length.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```
Expected Output:
```
1 2
1 2
```
or any other valid pair of subsets.

Actual Output:
The program might produce:
```
1 2
1 2
```
However, if the input is slightly different:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1
```
The program might fail to correctly pair the elements, leading to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, especially those involving non-adjacent duplicates and edge cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
