To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element.
   - `sz` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`.

Given that `ldb` is a non-empty list and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, the output will be the value of `elem` repeated twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem **(where elem is the second element in the list ldb)**
