Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and the loop stops when `2 * k - sz < 2` or when there are no more elements in `ldb` to process.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `ldb`.
- For each iteration, it checks if `2 * k - sz >= 2`.
- If the condition is true, it prints the current element twice and increments `sz` by 2.
- If the condition is false, the loop breaks.
- The loop continues until either the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true or all elements in `ldb` have been processed.
- The final value of `sz` will be the total number of elements printed in pairs before the loop breaks.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `rdb`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_`) remain unchanged.
