To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element.
   - `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus 2.
   - If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`.
   - `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is described as the next element in the iterable `sng`.
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over, `elem` will be the next element in this iterable.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the next element in the iterable `sng` followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the next element in the iterable `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the iterable sng)**
