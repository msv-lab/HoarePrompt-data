Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n/2), and the array `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[i - 1])
    if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `len(l)-1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, and `k` is 0 if it reached 0 during the loop execution. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `l` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, and `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is the index of the last element processed in `l` (which is `len(l) - 1`), `ans1` contains all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` reached 0, `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `k` is 2 times its original input value minus the total reduction due to the loop, `l` is a non-empty list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, then the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is included in `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
