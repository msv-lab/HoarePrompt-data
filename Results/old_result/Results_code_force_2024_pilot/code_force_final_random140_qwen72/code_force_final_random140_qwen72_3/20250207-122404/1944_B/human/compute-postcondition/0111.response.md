Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` twice.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `ans1` already contained the value of `b[i]` (which is also `b[i - 1]`), after the append operation, `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
