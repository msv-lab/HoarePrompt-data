Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and the loop stops when `2 * k - sz < 2` or when there are no more elements in `ldb` to process.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus 1. If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`. `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus 2. If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`. `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over, `elem` is the next element in `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus 3. If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`. `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over, `elem` is the next element in `sng`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
