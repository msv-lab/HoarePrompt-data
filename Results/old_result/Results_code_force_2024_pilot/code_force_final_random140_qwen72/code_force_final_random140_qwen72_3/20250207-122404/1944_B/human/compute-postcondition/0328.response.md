Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is either 2, 4, or 6, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process. If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is either 4 or 6. Otherwise, `sz` is either 2 or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
