Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element.
   - `sz` is 0.
   - `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.
   - The value of `2 * k - sz` is at least 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement prints the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is explicitly defined as the first element in the list `ldb`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the first element in the non-empty list `ldb`, the print statement will output this element twice, followed by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the first element in the list ldb)**
