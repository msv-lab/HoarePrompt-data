To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `rdb` must contain at least one element.
   - `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4.
   - `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process.
   - If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is either 2 or 4. Otherwise, `sz` is either 0 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing two instances of the variable `elem` with a space in between and no newline at the end.
   - The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be defined somewhere in the context of the code where this `print` statement is located. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `elem`, we cannot determine its exact value from the given information.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Without knowing the exact value of `elem`, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the value of the variable elem)**
