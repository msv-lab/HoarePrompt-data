Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, `k` is `req`, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not consecutive duplicates, the loop has completed all iterations, and if `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` now includes `b[n-1]`.**
