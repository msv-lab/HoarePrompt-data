The function `func_1()` is called, but without knowing the implementation details of `func_1()`, it's impossible to determine its exact impact on the program state. However, based on the initial state, the only information we have is that `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 50, and `_` is a placeholder that does not affect the loop's execution. Since the function call does not provide any return value or modify any known variables, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 50, `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.**
