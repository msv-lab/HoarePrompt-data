Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterating over each test case using `func_1()`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: For `n <= 1`, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have a string with exactly one special character (since a special character must be equal to one of its neighbors, and a single character cannot satisfy this condition).

3. **String Construction**:
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of the same character until `n` is reduced to zero.
   - The use of `letter[i % 26]` ensures that the program cycles through the alphabet, preventing the string from becoming too long and ensuring that the output is within the specified length limit (200 characters).

4. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the constructed string when a valid string is found, and "NO" when no valid string exists.

5. **State Management**: The state management within the functions is correct. The variables are updated appropriately, and the final state of the program after each function call is as expected.

Given these points, the program appears to meet all the requirements of the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
