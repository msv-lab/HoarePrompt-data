The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, given the context of the parameter constraints (t and n being integers within specific ranges), it seems these parameters might be used internally or passed implicitly through some other means not shown in the function signature. The output description is missing, so I cannot determine what the function returns based on these parameters.

To accurately describe the functionality, I need the output behavior of the function. Could you provide the expected output or the cases for different values of `t` and `n`?

For now, based on the given information:
Functionality: **The function `func` is intended to operate with internal or implicitly passed parameters `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50. The exact return value or behavior of the function is not specified.**
