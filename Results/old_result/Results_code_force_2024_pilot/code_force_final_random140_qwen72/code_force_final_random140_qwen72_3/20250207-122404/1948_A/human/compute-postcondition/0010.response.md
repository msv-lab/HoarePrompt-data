The code snippet `res += letter[i % 26] * 2` updates the value of `res` by appending twice the character at the position `i % 26` in the string `letter`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
- `i` is 0
- `res` is an empty string
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2

Since `i` is 0, `i % 26` is 0. The character at index 0 in `letter` is 'A'. Therefore, `res` will be updated to 'AA'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 0, `res` is 'AA', and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**
