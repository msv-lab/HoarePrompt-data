Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 2, `res` is 'AABB' + 'C' if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` is 'AAB' + 'C'.**

Explanation: The code appends the character at index `i % 26` of the string `letter` to the variable `res`. Since `i` is 2, `i % 26` is 2, and the character at index 2 of `letter` is 'C'. Therefore, 'C' is appended to `res`. The value of `res` was initially 'AABB' if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and 'AAB' if `n` is less than 2. After the code executes, `res` becomes 'AABB' + 'C' or 'AAB' + 'C' depending on the value of `n`. The values of `n`, `letter`, and `i` remain unchanged.
