Output State: **`n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is `initial_n // 2`, and `res` is a string where each pair of consecutive letters from 'A' to the letter corresponding to `i % 26` is repeated twice, except for the last letter which may appear only once if `initial_n` is odd.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. Each iteration reduces `n` by 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, or by 1 if `n` is 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `n` will be 0.
- **`letter`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration. Since `n` starts as an integer between 2 and 50 and is reduced by 2 in most iterations, `i` will be equal to `initial_n // 2` when the loop finishes.
- **`res`**: The string `res` is built by appending two copies of the current letter (determined by `i % 26`) to `res` in each iteration where `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is 1, only one copy of the current letter is appended. Thus, `res` will contain pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' to the letter corresponding to `i % 26`, with the last letter appearing only once if `initial_n` is odd.
