Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). If `n` is 1 or less, the current value of `n` is 1 or less. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is `initial_n // 2`, and `res` is a string where each pair of consecutive letters from 'A' to the letter corresponding to `i % 26` is repeated twice, except for the last letter which may appear only once if `initial_n` is odd.***
