The value of `i` is 2, and `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The expression `i % 26` evaluates to `2 % 26`, which is 2. The character at index 2 in `letter` is 'C'. Therefore, `letter[i % 26]` is 'C'. The expression `letter[i % 26] * 2` results in 'CC'. This string 'CC' is appended to the current value of `res`.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is 'AABB'.
- If `n` is less than 2, `res` is 'AAB'.

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is greater than or equal to 2, so `res` is initially 'AABB'. After appending 'CC' to `res`, the new value of `res` is 'AABBCC'.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 2, `res` is 'AABBCC'.**
