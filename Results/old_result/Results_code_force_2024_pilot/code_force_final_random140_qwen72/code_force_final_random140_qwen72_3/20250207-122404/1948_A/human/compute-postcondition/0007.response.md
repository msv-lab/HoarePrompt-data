Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 50, and the loop has completed all `t` iterations. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains the same as it was initially (an integer between 1 and 50). The loop has run exactly `t` times, and the placeholder variable `_` has no impact on the loop or any other part of the program.
