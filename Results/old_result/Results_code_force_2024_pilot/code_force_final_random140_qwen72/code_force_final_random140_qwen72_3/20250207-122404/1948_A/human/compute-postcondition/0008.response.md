The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Given the constraint that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, the function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it likely uses `t` internally to determine its output. Since the exact output is not provided, I can only infer that the function may return a value or perform an action based on the value of `t`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It likely uses an internal variable `t` (an integer where 1 <= t <= 50) to determine its output, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
