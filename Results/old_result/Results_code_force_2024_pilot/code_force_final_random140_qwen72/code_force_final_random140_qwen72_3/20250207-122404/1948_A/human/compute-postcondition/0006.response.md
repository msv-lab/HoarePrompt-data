The function `func_1()` is called, but without the definition of `func_1()`, it's impossible to determine its exact behavior or what changes it might make to the variables. However, since no specific changes to the variables `t` or `_` are mentioned, we assume that these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 50, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.**
