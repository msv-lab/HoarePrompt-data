The code snippet `res += letter[i % 26]` appends the character at the index `i % 26` from the string `letter` to the string `res`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is 'AA' if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which is true in this case since `n` is between 2 and 50.

Since `i` is 1, `i % 26` is 1. The character at index 1 in `letter` is 'B'. Therefore, `res` will become 'AAB'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1, `res` is 'AAB'.**
