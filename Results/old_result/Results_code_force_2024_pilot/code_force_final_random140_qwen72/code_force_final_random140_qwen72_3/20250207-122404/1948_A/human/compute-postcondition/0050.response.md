The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `x` from the string `s` twice. Given that `x` is 1, the character at index 1 of `s` (which is 'B') is appended twice to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` changes from 'AA' to 'AABB'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
