Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, `ans` is the first (n // 2) letters of `s`, each repeated twice, `x` is n // 2, and `j` is (n // 2) - 1.***
