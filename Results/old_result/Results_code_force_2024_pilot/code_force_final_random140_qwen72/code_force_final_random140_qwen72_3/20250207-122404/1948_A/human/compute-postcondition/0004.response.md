The function `func_1()` is called, but since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the changes it might make to the variables. However, based on the initial state, we know that `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 50, and `t` must be greater than 1. The placeholder `_` does not affect the loop's execution.

Since no specific changes to the variables are observable from the given code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 50, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.**
