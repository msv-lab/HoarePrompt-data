Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from standard input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `res` constructed by repeating pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' to the letter corresponding to `i % 26` (where `i` is incremented starting from 0), with each pair repeated twice, except for the last letter which may appear only once if `n` is odd. After the function concludes, `n` is 0, and the string `res` is printed. **
