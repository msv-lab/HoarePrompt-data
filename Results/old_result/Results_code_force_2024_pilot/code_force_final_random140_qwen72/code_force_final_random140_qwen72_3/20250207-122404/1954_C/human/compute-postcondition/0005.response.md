Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes `kq2` to an empty string. No other variables are affected, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
