Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `x`, `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal or not.**
