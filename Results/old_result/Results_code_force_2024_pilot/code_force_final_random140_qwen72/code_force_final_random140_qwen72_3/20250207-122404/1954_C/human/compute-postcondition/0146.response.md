Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2, and `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. If `a[2]` equals `b[2]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each updated to include `a[2]`. If `a[2]` does not equal `b[2]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated to the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated to the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is updated to `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated to `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.***
