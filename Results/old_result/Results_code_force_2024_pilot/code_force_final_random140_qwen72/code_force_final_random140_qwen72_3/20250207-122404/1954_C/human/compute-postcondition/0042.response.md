The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to the variable `kq1`. Since `kq1` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty string before this operation. After the operation, `kq1` will contain the string representation of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `q` is 0
- `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters
- `b` is an input string
- `i` is 2
- `vt` is 1
- `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`
- `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`

After executing the code:
- `kq1` is now the string representation of `x`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`.**
