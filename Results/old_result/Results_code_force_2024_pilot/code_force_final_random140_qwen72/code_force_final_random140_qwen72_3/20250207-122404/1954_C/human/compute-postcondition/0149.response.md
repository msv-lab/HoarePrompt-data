To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind the construction of `kq2`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` is 2.
- `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `kq1` is a string that contains the minimum character between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, alternating based on the value of `vt`, and the same character as `a[i]` when `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.
- `kq2` is a string that contains the maximum character between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, alternating based on the value of `vt`, and the same character as `a[i]` when `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.
- `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions and the alternation pattern during the loop execution.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts at the last index of the string `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`).
   - `vt` is used to alternate between choosing the minimum and maximum characters.

2. **Construction of `kq2`**:
   - For each index `i` from `len(a) - 1` to 0:
     - If `a[i]` is different from `b[i]`, the maximum character between `a[i]` and `b[i]` is chosen and added to `kq2`.
     - If `a[i]` is the same as `b[i]`, the character `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) is added to `kq2`.
     - The value of `vt` alternates after each choice.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `a = "abc"` and `b = "def"`.
- `i` starts at 2 (the last index of `a`).

1. **i = 2**:
   - `a[2] = 'c'` and `b[2] = 'f'`.
   - Since `c` and `f` are different, the maximum character is `f`.
   - `kq2` becomes `"f"`.
   - `vt` alternates.

2. **i = 1**:
   - `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'e'`.
   - Since `b` and `e` are different, the maximum character is `e`.
   - `kq2` becomes `"fe"`.
   - `vt` alternates.

3. **i = 0**:
   - `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'd'`.
   - Since `a` and `d` are different, the maximum character is `d`.
   - `kq2` becomes `"fed"`.
   - `vt` alternates.

### Final Output:
The `print(kq2)` statement will print the string `kq2` constructed as described above.

Output: **kq2 (where kq2 is a string containing the maximum character between a[i] and b[i] for each i where a[i] and b[i] are different, alternating based on the value of vt, and the same character as a[i] when a[i] equals b[i])**
