Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the smaller of the integers represented by the first characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger of these integers. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains non-zero.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each updated by concatenating `a[1]` to their current values, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome. If `a[2]` equals `b[2]`, `kq1` is the character at index 2 of `a`, and `kq2` is the character at index 2 of `a` concatenated with itself. If `a[2]` does not equal `b[2]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is updated to 1, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
