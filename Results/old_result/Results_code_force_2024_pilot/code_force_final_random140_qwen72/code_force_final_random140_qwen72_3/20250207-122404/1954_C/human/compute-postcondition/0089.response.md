Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 2, `kq1` is `kq1 + a[2]`, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[2]`, `vt` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.**
