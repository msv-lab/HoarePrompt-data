To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind the construction of `kq1`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` is 1.
- `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters.
- `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `kq1` is a string constructed as follows:
  - Each character in `kq1` is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character in `b`, or the minimum of the corresponding characters from `a` and `b` based on the alternating pattern determined by `vt`.
- `kq2` is a string constructed similarly but using the maximum of the corresponding characters from `a` and `b`.
- `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the alternating pattern has been triggered during the loop.

### Construction of `kq1`:
- The string `kq1` is built by iterating through the characters of `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning (since `i` starts at `len(a) - 1`).
- For each character position `i`:
  - If the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `kq1` gets the character from `a[i]`.
  - If the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the character added to `kq1` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` based on the alternating pattern determined by `vt`.
  - The value of `vt` alternates between 0 and 1 after each character is processed.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `a = "abc"` and `b = "abd"`.
- `i` starts at 2 (the last index of the strings).

1. **i = 2**:
   - `a[2] = 'c'` and `b[2] = 'd'`.
   - Since `c` != `d`, we take the minimum of `c` and `d`, which is `c`.
   - `vt` is initially 0, so `kq1` gets `c`.
   - `vt` becomes 1.

2. **i = 1**:
   - `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'b'`.
   - Since `b` == `b`, `kq1` gets `b`.
   - `vt` remains 1.

3. **i = 0**:
   - `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'a'`.
   - Since `a` == `a`, `kq1` gets `a`.
   - `vt` remains 1.

Thus, `kq1` would be `"cba"`.

### General Case:
Given the initial state and the construction rules, the string `kq1` will be a string where each character is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character in `b`, or the minimum of the corresponding characters from `a` and `b` based on the alternating pattern determined by `vt`.

### Final Output:
Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string constructed by taking the minimum of corresponding characters from a and b based on an alternating pattern determined by vt, or the corresponding character from a if it matches the corresponding character in b)**
