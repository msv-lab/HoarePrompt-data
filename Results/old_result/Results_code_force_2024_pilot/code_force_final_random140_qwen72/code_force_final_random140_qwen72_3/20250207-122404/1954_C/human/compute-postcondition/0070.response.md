Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is not 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1`.
- Initially, `kq1` was an empty string, so after the execution, `kq1` becomes the string representation of `y`.
- All other variables (`t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq2`, `vt`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
