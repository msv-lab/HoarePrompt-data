Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 0, `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is the first character of `a`, `vt` is 0, and the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.**
