The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` of equal length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It then generates two new strings `kq1` and `kq2` based on the following rules: If the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` take that character. If the characters differ, the smaller character is added to `kq1` and the larger to `kq2` for the first differing position, and vice versa for subsequent positions. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
