To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` is 2.
- `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `kq1` is a string that contains the minimum character between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, alternating based on the value of `vt`, and the same character as `a[i]` when `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.
- `kq2` is a string that contains the maximum character between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, alternating based on the value of `vt`, and the same character as `a[i]` when `a[i]` equals `b[i]`.
- `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions and the alternation pattern during the loop execution.

### Explanation:
- The variable `kq1` is constructed by iterating over the characters of `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning (since `i` starts at `len(a) - 1`).
- For each position `i`:
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the minimum character between `a[i]` and `b[i]` is added to `kq1`.
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the character `a[i]` is added to `kq1`.
- The alternation pattern is controlled by `vt`, which can be 0 or 1. This means that the choice of minimum or maximum character might alternate based on the value of `vt`.

### Output:
The `print(kq1)` statement will print the string `kq1`, which is constructed based on the rules described above. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string containing the minimum character between a[i] and b[i] for each i where a[i] and b[i] are different, alternating based on the value of vt, and the same character as a[i] when a[i] equals b[i])**
