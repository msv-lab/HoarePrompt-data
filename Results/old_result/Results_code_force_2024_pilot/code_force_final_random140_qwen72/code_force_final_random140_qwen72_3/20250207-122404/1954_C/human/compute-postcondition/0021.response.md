Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 0, `x` is the smaller of the integers represented by the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integers represented by the first characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is not 0.***
