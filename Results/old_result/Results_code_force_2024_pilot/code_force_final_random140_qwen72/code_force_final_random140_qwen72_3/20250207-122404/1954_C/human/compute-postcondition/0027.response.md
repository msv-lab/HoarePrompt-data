Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the conditions described, `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`.**
