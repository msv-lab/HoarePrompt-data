Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, and `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, and `i` is 1. If `a[1]` equals `b[1]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both updated to their previous values concatenated with the second character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. If `a[1]` does not equal `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated to the string representation of `x` if the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, otherwise `kq1` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the string representation of `x`. Similarly, `kq2` is updated to the string representation of `y` if the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, otherwise `kq2` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, and `i` is 2. If `a[2] == b[2]`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[2]`, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + a[2]`, and `vt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to '1' concatenated with the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is set to '1' concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is updated to the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is updated to the original value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
