Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, and `i` is 1. If `a[1]` equals `b[1]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both updated to their previous values concatenated with the second character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. If `a[1]` does not equal `b[1]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated to the string representation of `x` if the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, otherwise `kq1` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the string representation of `x`. Similarly, `kq2` is updated to the string representation of `y` if the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, otherwise `kq2` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.***
