The code snippet updates the variable `kq2` by appending the string representation of `y` to it. Here's the detailed step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
   - `q` is 0
   - `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters
   - `b` is an input string
   - `i` is 2
   - `vt` is 1
   - `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`
   - `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`
   - `kq1` is the string representation of `x`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)`

3. **Impact:**
   - `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value. Since `kq2` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be an empty string initially.

4. **Final State:**
   - `kq2` now contains the string representation of `y`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y`.**
