Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` + str(y), `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` + str(x), `vt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `kq1`, `vt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
