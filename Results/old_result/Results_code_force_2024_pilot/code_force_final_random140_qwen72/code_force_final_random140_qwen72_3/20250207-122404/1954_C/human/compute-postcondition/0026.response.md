Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[1]`, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + a[1]`, `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
