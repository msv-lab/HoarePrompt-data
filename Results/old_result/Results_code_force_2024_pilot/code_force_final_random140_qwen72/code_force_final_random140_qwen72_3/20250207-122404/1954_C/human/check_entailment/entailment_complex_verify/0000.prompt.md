You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is `t-1` (indicating the loop has completed its final iteration), `a` and `b` are the last input strings provided for the final iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (indicating the completion of the inner loop over the characters of `a` and `b`), `kq1` and `kq2` are the final strings formed by the rules specified in the loop for the last iteration, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last comparison made in the final iteration. All other variables not modified within the loop remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` of equal length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It then generates two new strings `kq1` and `kq2` based on the following rules: If the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` take that character. If the characters differ, the smaller character is added to `kq1` and the larger to `kq2` for the first differing position, and vice versa for subsequent positions. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always maximize the product of \(x\) and \(y\). Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
43
34
```

Expected Output:
```
44
33
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
34
43
```

In this case, the program swaps the digits incorrectly, resulting in a smaller product compared to the expected output. The expected output maximizes the product by making both numbers as large as possible, but the program's logic does not ensure this. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
