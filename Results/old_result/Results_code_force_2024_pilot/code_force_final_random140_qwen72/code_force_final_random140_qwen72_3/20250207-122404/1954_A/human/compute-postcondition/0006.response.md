Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `itest` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is the third integer from the input.
- The conditions `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) > k` are satisfied.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will always print the string `'Yes'` because the conditions specified in the initial state ensure that the logic leading up to this print statement is valid. The specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k` do not affect the output of this particular print statement, as it simply prints a fixed string.

Output: **Yes**
