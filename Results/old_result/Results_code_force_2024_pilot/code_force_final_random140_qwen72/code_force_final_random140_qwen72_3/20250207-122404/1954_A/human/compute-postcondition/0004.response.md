Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `itest` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is the third integer from the input.
- The condition is that either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`.

Given the `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
