The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides the following:
   - `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `itest` is 2.
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `k` is the third integer from the new input.
   
2. The `print` statement is:
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output: **Yes**
