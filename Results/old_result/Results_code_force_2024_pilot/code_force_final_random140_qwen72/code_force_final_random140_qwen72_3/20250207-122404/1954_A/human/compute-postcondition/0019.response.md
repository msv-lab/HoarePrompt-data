The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it seems to process multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50`. The total number of test cases, `t`, is an integer within the range `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.

However, without the actual function body or further context, the exact return value cannot be determined from the given information alone. Assuming the function processes each test case and returns some result based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (where `1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50`). For each test case, the function computes and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.**
