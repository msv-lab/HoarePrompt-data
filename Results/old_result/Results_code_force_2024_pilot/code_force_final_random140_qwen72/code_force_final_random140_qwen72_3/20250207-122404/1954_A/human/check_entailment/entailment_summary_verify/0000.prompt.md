You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (where `1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50`). It then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state is unchanged except for the output produced.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:` checks two scenarios:
     - **`n <= k`**: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Hence, Alice cannot prevent this, and the output should be 'NO'.
     - **`n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**: This condition ensures that if the number of distinct colors used by Alice is such that Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, then the output should be 'NO'. Specifically, `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that must be different to ensure Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color. If the remaining parts after this calculation are less than or equal to `k`, Bob can still achieve his goal.

3. **Output**: The program prints 'NO' if either of the above conditions is true, and 'Yes' otherwise.

The logic in the program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs within the constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
