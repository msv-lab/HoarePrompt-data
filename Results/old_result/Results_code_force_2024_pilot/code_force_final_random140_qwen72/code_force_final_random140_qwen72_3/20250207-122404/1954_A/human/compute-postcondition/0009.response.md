Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `itest` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, and `k` is the third integer from the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `itest` is 1.
- The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively.
- After executing this code, `n`, `m`, and `k` now hold the values of the first, second, and third integers from the input.
- The conditions regarding `n`, `m`, and `k` (whether `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`) are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as part of the initial state.
- The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged.
