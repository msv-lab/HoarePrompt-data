Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to correctly address the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:` checks two scenarios:
     - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon, making it impossible for Alice to prevent him from achieving his goal.
     - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, this means that even if Alice tries to distribute the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
   - If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that Bob can make all parts the same color.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

3. **Output**: The output format matches the problem requirements, printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program should correctly handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
