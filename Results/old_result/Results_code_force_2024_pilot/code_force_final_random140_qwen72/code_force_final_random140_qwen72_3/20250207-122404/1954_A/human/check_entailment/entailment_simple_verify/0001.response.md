### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint up to `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot achieve this.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Succeed:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color regardless of Alice's initial painting.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, Bob can still achieve his goal. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must be painted the same color to ensure that no matter how Alice paints, Bob can always repaint up to `k` parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Succeed:**
   - If neither of the above conditions hold, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if either `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` holds true.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is true, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Example 2:** `n = 5, m = 1, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 <= k` is true, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Example 3:** `n = 5, m = 2, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 > k`, so the output should be 'YES'.
   - **Example 4:** `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 <= k`, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Example 5:** `n = 5, m = 5, k = 3`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 > k`, so the output should be 'YES'.

6. **Annotated Code Verification:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly handles the input and output for each test case.
   - The conditions `n <= k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` are correctly evaluated.
   - The output is printed as 'NO' or 'Yes' based on these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and logic are sound and match the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
