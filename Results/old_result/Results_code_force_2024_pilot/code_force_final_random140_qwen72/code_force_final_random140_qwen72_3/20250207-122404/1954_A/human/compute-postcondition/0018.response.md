Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `itest` is `t`, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `m`, and `k` were integers where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. For each test case, if `n` was less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` was less than or equal to `k`, the output was 'NO'. Otherwise, the output was 'Yes'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, with `itest` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration until it reaches `t`.
- For each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input.
- The condition checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`. If either condition is true, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.
- After all iterations, `itest` will be equal to `t`, and the loop will have processed all `t` test cases according to the specified conditions.
