The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which is split into three integers. The input is expected to be three space-separated integers. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `itest` also remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `itest` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input.**
