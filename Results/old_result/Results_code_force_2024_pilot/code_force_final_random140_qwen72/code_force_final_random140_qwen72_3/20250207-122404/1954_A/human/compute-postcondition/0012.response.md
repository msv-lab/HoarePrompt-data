Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `itest` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, and `k` is the third integer from the input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
