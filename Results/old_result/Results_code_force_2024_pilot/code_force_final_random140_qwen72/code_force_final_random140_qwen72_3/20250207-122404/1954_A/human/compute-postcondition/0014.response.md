The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation overwrites the initial values of these variables. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within a certain range, `itest` is 2, and the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are derived from the input. After executing the code, the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are taken from the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `itest` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, and `k` is the third integer from the new input.**
