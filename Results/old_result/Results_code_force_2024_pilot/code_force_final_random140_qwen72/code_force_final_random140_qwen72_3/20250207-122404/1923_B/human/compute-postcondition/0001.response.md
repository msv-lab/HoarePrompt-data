The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, which ensures that `t` is always greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

However, since the task specifies that we need to adjust the states for the loop to execute, and the only variable in the loop head is `_`, we can consider the initial state of `_` as it would be when the loop starts. In Python, the underscore `_` is often used as a throwaway variable, and it doesn't have a specific value before the loop starts. But for the purpose of this task, we can say that `_` is initialized to 0 (or any other value, but it's typically not relevant since it's a throwaway variable).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 0**
