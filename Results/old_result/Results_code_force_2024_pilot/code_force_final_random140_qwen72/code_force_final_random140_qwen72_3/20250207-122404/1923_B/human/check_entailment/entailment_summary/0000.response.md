### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and ensures it is a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4).
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - If the input for `t` is invalid, it prints "Invalid input format" and exits.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the values of `n` and `k` for a single test case.
   - It then reads a list `a` of `n` integers representing the health of the monsters.
   - It reads `n` additional integers representing the positions of the monsters and updates a list `b` of length `n + 1` based on the absolute values of these positions.
   - The function calculates the total number of bullets available (`r`) and checks if it is sufficient to kill all monsters before any of them reach the character.
   - If at any point the total bullets available (`r`) are less than the required bullets to kill the monsters at a certain distance, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - If the condition holds for all distances, it prints "YES".

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: Both functions handle input validation correctly. `func_2` ensures `t` is within the valid range, and `func_1` ensures `n` and `k` are valid integers.
- **Logic**:
  - The logic in `func_1` correctly processes the input to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters.
  - The use of the list `b` to accumulate the total health of monsters at each distance is appropriate.
  - The condition check to ensure the player has enough bullets to kill the monsters at each distance is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles input validation and processes the data to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters.

### Correctness:
**True**
