Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the input for the positions of the monsters (`x`) is read one by one in a loop, which is incorrect according to the problem's input format. The positions should be read as a single line of space-separated integers, similar to how the health values (`a`) are read.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1` that reads the positions correctly:

```python
def func_1():
    try:
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the array to store the total health of monsters at each distance
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            dist = abs(x[i])
            b[dist] += a[i]
        
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            r -= b[i]
        print('YES')
    except ValueError:
        print('Invalid input format')
```

With this correction, the function should correctly process the input and determine if you can survive and kill all the monsters. The overall structure of the program, including the handling of multiple test cases in `func_2`, remains correct.
