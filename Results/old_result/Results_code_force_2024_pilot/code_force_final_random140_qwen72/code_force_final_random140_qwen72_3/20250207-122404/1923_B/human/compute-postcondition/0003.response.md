The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. At the start of the next iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 < t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 1**
