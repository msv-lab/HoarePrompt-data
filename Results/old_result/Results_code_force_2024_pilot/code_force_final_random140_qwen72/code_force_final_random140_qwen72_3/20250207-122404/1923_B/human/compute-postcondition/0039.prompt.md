You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b is a list of length n + 1 initialized to 0.
def func_1():
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is the last input integer, and for each index `j` in the range from 0 to `n`, `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j`.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is the last input integer, `b` is an array where each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j` for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n`, and `r` is `k * n - sum(b[1:n])`, with `r` being greater than or equal to each `b[i]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. If at any point `r` is less than `b[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and returns without completing the loop.
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: If the input format is valid, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j`, and `r` is `k * n - sum(b[1:n])`. If at any point `r` is less than `b[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and returns without completing the loop. If the loop completes, the program prints 'YES'. If a `ValueError` occurs, the program prints 'Invalid input format' and returns.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates on implicit parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of zeros. The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value.

Case_2: The program does not return any value.

Case_3: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
