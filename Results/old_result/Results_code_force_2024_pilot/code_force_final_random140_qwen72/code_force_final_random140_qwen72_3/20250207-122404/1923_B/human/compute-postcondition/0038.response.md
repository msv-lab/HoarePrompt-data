The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided context, it implicitly works with the following parameters: `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0. The function does not return any value in any of the cases described.

Functionality: **The function operates on implicit parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of zeros. The function does not return any value.**
