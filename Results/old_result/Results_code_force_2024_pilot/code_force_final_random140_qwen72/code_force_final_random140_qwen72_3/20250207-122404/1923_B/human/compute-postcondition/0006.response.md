The provided code snippet calls a function named `func_1()`. However, the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact behavior or the changes it might make to the variables. Without the function's definition, we can only state that the function has been called.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 < t ≤ 3 · 10^4
- `_` is 2

Since the function `func_1()` does not modify any known variables (as its definition is not provided), the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 < t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 2**
