You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

    YES

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    try:
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            r -= b[i]
        print('YES')
    except ValueError:
        print('Invalid input format')

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
    except ValueError:
        print('Invalid input format')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `t` is expected to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. If the input is a valid integer within this range, the function calls another function `func_1` exactly `t` times. If the input is not a valid integer or is outside the specified range, the function prints "Invalid input format" and does not execute the loop or call `func_1`. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` is supposed to handle multiple test cases, but it calls `func_1` inside a loop. However, `func_1` reads inputs directly from `input()`, which means it will read the next set of inputs for each test case, but it does not reset the state between test cases. This can lead to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

2. **Incorrect Input Reading for Monster Positions**: In `func_1`, the positions of the monsters (`x`) are read one by one using a loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       x = int(input())
       b[abs(x)] += a[i]
   ```
   This is incorrect because the problem description states that the positions of the monsters are given in a single line as a list of integers. The correct way to read these positions would be:
   ```python
   x = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```

3. **Incorrect Logic for Handling Monster Health and Positions**: The logic in `func_1` uses `b[abs(x)]` to accumulate the health of monsters at each position. This is incorrect because the positions can be negative, and the array `b` is indexed from 0 to `n`. This can lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect accumulation of health values.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Bullets**: The variable `r` is used to track the remaining bullets, but it is not correctly updated to reflect the actual number of bullets fired. The logic:
   ```python
   r += k
   if r < b[i]:
       print('NO')
       return
   r -= b[i]
   ```
   does not correctly account for the fact that the number of bullets fired in each second should be limited by `k`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
