### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets per second `k`.
   - It then reads the health values of the monsters into a list `a`.
   - The positions of the monsters are read one by one and used to update a list `b` where `b[i]` represents the total health of monsters that are `i` units away from the player.

2. **Logic for Survival:**
   - The function initializes a variable `r` to keep track of the total number of bullets available.
   - It iterates through the distances from 1 to `n` (since the maximum distance a monster can be is `n`).
   - For each distance `i`, it adds `k` bullets to `r` (since you can fire `k` bullets per second).
   - It then checks if the total health of monsters at distance `i` (`b[i]`) is greater than the available bullets `r`. If so, it prints "NO" and returns, indicating that the player cannot survive.
   - If the player has enough bullets to kill all monsters at distance `i`, it subtracts the required bullets from `r`.

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles invalid input formats by catching `ValueError` and printing an error message.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The logic correctly simulates the game's rules and checks if the player can survive by ensuring that the total number of bullets available is always sufficient to kill the monsters before they reach the player.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and edge cases.
