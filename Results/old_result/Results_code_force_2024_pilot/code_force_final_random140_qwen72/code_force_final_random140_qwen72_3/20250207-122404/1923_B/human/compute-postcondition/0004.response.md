The function `func_1()` is called, but there's no information provided about what this function does or what it returns. Without knowing the definition of `func_1()`, we cannot determine its impact on the program state. However, since the function call itself does not modify the variables `t` or `_` directly, we assume these variables remain unchanged unless `func_1()` modifies them internally, which we cannot determine from the given information.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 < t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 1**.
