Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the last input integer.
- `b` is an array where each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j` for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n`.
- `r` is `k`.
- The current value of `r` is less than `b[i]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `n`: A positive integer.
   - `i`: An integer with a value of 1.
   - `x`: The last input integer.
   - `b`: An array where each element `b[j]` is incremented based on certain conditions involving user input and the array `a`.
   - `r`: A variable that is equal to `k`.
   - `r < b[i]`: This condition is explicitly stated to be true.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

### Explanation:
- The print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
