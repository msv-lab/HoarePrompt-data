Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers, and then `n` additional integers. It processes these inputs to update a list `b` of length `n + 1` based on the absolute values of the additional integers. The function checks if a certain condition involving `k` and the updated list `b` is met. If the condition fails at any point, the function prints 'NO' and exits. If the condition holds for all elements, the function prints 'YES'. In case of invalid input, the function prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value. **
