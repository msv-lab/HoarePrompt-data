The provided code snippet calls a function named `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the changes it might make to the variables. However, based on the initial state, we can infer that calling `func_1()` does not inherently change the values of `t` or `_` unless explicitly stated within the function, which is not provided.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 0**
