Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is t-1.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `_` will have the value `t-1`, where `t` is the input integer that determines the number of iterations. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was defined before the loop started. The loop iterates `t` times, and on each iteration, the value of `_` increases from 0 to `t-1`.
