t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9; a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; and a list of n distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
