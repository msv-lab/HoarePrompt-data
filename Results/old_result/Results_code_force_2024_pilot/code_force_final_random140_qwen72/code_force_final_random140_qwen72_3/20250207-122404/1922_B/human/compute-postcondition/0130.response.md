Output State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the `ans` calculated for each iteration of the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain exactly `t` elements. Each element in the `results` list corresponds to the `ans` value calculated during each iteration of the loop. The `ans` value for each iteration is determined by the sum of the values in the `hashing` dictionary for each element in the list `a` that appears consecutively. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `current_index`, `i`, `hashing`) will retain their final values as they were after the last iteration of the loop.
