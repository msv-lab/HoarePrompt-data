The code snippet `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `a[1]` is in `hashing`
- `hashing[a[1]]` is 1

The value of `a[i]` is `a[1]`, and `hashing[a[1]]` is 1. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `a[1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a[1]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1.**
