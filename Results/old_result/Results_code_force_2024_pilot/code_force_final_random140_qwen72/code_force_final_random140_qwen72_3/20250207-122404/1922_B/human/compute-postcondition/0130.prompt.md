Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is the initial value provided, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]` (the first element of the `data` list), `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements from the last processed segment of `data`, `current_index` is the index just after the last processed element in `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the `ans` calculated for each iteration, `i` is `n - 1` for the last iteration, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the cumulative indices for each unique element in the last processed list `a`, and `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, and `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element in `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing at least three elements, `result` is the third element in `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
