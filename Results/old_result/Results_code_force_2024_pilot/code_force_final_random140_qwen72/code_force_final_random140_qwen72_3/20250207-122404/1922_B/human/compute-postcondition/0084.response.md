The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the sum of indices `i` for which `a[i]` appears in the list `a` up to the current iteration.**

Note: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, it is the only one that changes. All other variables remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
