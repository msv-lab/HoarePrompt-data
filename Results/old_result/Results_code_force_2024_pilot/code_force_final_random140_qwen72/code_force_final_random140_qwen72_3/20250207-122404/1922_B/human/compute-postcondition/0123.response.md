Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is the initial value provided, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]` (the first element of the `data` list), `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements from the last processed segment of `data`, `current_index` is the index just after the last processed element in `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the `ans` calculated for each iteration, `i` is `n - 1` for the last iteration, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the cumulative indices for each unique element in the last processed list `a`, and `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, and `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data.**
