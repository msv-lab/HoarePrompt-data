Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. A non-degenerate triangle has the property that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

The provided program reads input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the results. However, the logic used to calculate the number of valid triangles is flawed. Specifically, the program uses a hash map to track the cumulative indices of elements and adds these indices to the answer when consecutive elements are equal. This approach does not correctly implement the triangle inequality condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the list of stick lengths.
2. Iterate through the sorted list and use a two-pointer technique to count the number of valid triplets that satisfy the triangle inequality.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly count the number of valid triangles. For example, in the second test case with stick lengths `[3, 2, 1, 3]`, the program should output `2` (valid triplets are `(1, 2, 3)` and `(1, 3, 3)`), but the current logic does not ensure this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
