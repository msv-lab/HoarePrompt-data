To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 as per the `range(n)` function.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `a` is an empty list
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data
- `current_index` is 2
- `results` is an empty list
- `hashing` is an empty dictionary

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0**
