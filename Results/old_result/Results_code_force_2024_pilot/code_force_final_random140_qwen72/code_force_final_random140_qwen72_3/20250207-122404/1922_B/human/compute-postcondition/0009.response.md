Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `results`, `hashing`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
