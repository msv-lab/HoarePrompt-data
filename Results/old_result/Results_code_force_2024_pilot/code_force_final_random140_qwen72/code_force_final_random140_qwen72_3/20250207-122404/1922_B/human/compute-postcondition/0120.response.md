Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `hashing[a[i]]` is updated to `hashing[a[i]] + i`. If `a[i]` was already in `hashing`, its value is now `hashing[a[i]] + i`. If `a[i]` was not in `hashing`, it is added with the value `i`. If `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `ans` is updated to `ans + hashing[a[n - 1]]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
