Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing three elements `[int(data[current_index - 1]), int(data[current_index]), int(data[current_index])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 7`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing from `2 * n + 6` to `2 * n + 7`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
