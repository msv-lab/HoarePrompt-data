The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least two elements, and `result` is the second element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least three elements, and `result` will be the third element in `results`.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least three elements, `result` is the third element in `results`**
