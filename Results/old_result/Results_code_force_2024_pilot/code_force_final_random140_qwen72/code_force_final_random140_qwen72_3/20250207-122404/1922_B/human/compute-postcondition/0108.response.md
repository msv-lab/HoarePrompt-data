Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is set to `hashing[a[i]]`, and `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[n-1]` and its value updated to `i`. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `hashing` remain unchanged.***
