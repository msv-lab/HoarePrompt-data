Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `hashing[a[i]]`, `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[n-1]` and its value updated to `i`. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it.
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` is the last element in the list `a`, which is also equal to `a[i + 1]`.
- The dictionary `hashing` has a key `a[n-1]` (which is the same as `a[i]`) with a value of `i` (which is `n - 1`).
- Therefore, `hashing[a[i]]` is `i`, and `ans` is updated to `hashing[a[i]]`, which is `n - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
