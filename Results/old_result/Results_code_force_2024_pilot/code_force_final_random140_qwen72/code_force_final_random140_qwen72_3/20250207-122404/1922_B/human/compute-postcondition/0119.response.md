The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. Given the initial state, let's break down the changes:

- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2 (unchanged).
- `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]` (unchanged).
- `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n` (unchanged).
- `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]` (unchanged, but `ans` will be updated).
- `i` is `n - 1` (unchanged).
- `hashing[a[i]]` is updated to `hashing[a[i]] + i` (unchanged, but used in the calculation).

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.

Let's denote the last element of `a` as `a_last`. The value of `hashing[a_last]` is `hashing[a_last] + (n - 1)`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `ans + hashing[a_last]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `hashing[a[n - 1]]` is `hashing[a[n - 1]] + (n - 1)`, `ans` is `ans + hashing[a[n - 1]]`.**
