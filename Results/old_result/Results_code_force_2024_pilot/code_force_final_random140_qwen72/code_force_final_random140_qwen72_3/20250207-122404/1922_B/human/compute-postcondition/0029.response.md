The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Given that `i` is 0, and `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 0. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` now contains the key `a[0]` with the value `0 + i` (which is 0 + 0 = 0). Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.**
