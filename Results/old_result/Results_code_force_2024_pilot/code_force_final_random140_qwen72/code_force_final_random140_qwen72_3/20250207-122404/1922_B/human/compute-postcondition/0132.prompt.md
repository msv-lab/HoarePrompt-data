You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        hashing = {}
        
        n = int(data[current_index])
        
        current_index += 1
        
        a = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(int(data[current_index]))
            current_index += 1
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if a[i] not in hashing:
                hashing[a[i]] = 0
            hashing[a[i]] += i
            if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
                ans += hashing[a[i]]
        
        results.append(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is the initial value provided, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]` (the first element of the `data` list), `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements from the last processed segment of `data`, `current_index` is the index just after the last processed element in `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the `ans` calculated for each iteration, `i` is `n - 1` for the last iteration, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the cumulative indices for each unique element in the last processed list `a`, and `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the `ans` calculated for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
