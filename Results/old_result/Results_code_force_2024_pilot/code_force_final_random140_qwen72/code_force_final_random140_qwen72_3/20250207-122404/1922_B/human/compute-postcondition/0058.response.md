Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing three elements: `int(data[current_index - 1])`, `int(data[current_index])`, and `int(data[current_index + 1])`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 6`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing from `n + 5` to `n + 6`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
