Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]`, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[current_index]`, which is `data[2 * n + 3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
