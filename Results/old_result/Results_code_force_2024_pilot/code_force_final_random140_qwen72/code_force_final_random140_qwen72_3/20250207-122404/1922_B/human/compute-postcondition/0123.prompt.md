Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    hashing = {}
    n = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(data[current_index]))
        current_index += 1
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] not in hashing:
            hashing[a[i]] = 0
        hashing[a[i]] += i
        if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
            ans += hashing[a[i]]
    results.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` contains each unique element in `a` as keys, and their values are the cumulative indices where they appear in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the sum of indices `i` for which `a[i]` appears in the list `a` up to the current iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing three elements `[ans, ans, ans]`, `i` is `0`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the sum of indices where the element appears in `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
