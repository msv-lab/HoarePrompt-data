Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the dictionary `hashing` either contains the key `a[0]` with the value `0` or remains unchanged if `a[0]` was already in `hashing`.***
