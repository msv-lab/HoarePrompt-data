Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a[1]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `a[2]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[2]]` is 2, if `a[1] == a[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[2]]` by adding `i` (which is 2) to its current value.
- Initially, `a[2]` is not in `hashing`, so `hashing[a[2]]` is set to 0.
- After executing the code, `hashing[a[2]]` becomes 2 (0 + 2).
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged, including `i` being 2, `n` being greater than 2, `a[1]` being in `hashing`, and `hashing[a[1]]` being 1.
- If `a[1] == a[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1, as specified in the initial state.
