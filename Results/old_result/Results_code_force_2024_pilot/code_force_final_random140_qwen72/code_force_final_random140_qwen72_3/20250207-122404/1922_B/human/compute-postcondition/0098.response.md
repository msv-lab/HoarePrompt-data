Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be equal to or greater than the number of iterations, `a` is a list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 but is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs.
- **`n`**: The loop will run `n` times, so `n` must be equal to or greater than the number of iterations.
- **`a`**: After `n` iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, each of which is the integer value of `data` starting from `current_index` and incrementing by 1 for each iteration.
- **`current_index`**: After `n` iterations, `current_index` will be `2 * n + 4 + n`.
- **`results`**: Remains unchanged as a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`.
- **`i`**: After `n` iterations, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- **`ans`**: Remains the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`. Since `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` will be 0.
- **`hashing`**: Remains an empty dictionary `{}`.
