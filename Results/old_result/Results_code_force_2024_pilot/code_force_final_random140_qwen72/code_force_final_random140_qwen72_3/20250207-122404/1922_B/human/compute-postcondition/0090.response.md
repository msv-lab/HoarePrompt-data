Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element `[int(data[current_index])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` to the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` was an empty list, so now it contains one element, which is `int(data[current_index])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `current_index`, `results`, `i`, `ans`, `hashing`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
