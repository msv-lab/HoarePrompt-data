Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{a[n-1]: 0}`.**

Explanation:
- The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `hashing`.
- The key is `a[i]`, which is the last element in the list `a` (since `i` is `n - 1`).
- The value associated with this key is `0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
