You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is the initial value provided, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]` (the first element of the `data` list), `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements from the last processed segment of `data`, `current_index` is the index just after the last processed element in `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the `ans` calculated for each iteration, `i` is `n - 1` for the last iteration, `hashing` is a dictionary containing the cumulative indices for each unique element in the last processed list `a`, and `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data.

    #State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the `ans` calculated for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function calculates a specific value `ans` for each test case based on the sorted list `a` and a hash map that tracks the cumulative indices of elements. The final output is a list of these `ans` values, one for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic used in the program to count the number of valid triangles is flawed. Specifically, the program uses a hash map (`hashing`) to track the cumulative index of occurrences of each stick length and then adds these values to `ans` when consecutive elements are equal. This approach does not correctly account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 3
```
The correct output should be `1` because the only valid combination of sticks that can form a triangle is `(2, 3, 3)` (lengths 2, 4, and 4). However, the program will incorrectly output `2` because it counts the pairs `(1, 3, 3)` and `(2, 3, 3)` without checking the triangle inequality condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Sort the array of stick lengths.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and use a nested loop to check all possible combinations of three sticks.
3. For each combination, check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
4. Count the number of valid combinations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def count_triangles(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, a in test_cases:
        a.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            k = i + 2
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                while k < n and a[i] + a[j] > a[k]:
                    k += 1
                count += k - j - 1
        results.append(count)
    return results

t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))

results = count_triangles(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the triangle inequality theorem is checked for every combination of three sticks, thus providing the correct count of valid triangles.
