Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[n-1]` and its value updated to `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing`.
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, the key `a[n-1]` in the dictionary `hashing` is updated to `i`, which is `n - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
