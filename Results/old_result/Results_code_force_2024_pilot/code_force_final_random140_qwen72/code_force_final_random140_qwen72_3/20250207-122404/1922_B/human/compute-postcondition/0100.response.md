Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be equal to or greater than the number of iterations, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `current_index`, `results`, `i`, `hashing`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
