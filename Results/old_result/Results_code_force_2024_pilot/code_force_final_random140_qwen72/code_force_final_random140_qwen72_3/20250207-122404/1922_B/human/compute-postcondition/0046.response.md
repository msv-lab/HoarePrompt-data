The provided code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `hashing`. This action does not affect any of the other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. The only change is that `hashing` is now explicitly defined as an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**
