The code snippet `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data
- `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`
- `results` is a list containing one element `ans`
- `i` is `0`
- `ans` is 0
- `hashing[a[0]]` is `0` (if `a[0]` was not previously in `hashing`), or `hashing[a[0]]` is incremented by `0` (if `a[0]` was already in `hashing`)

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `hashing[a[0]]` to it. Since `i` is `0`, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. According to the initial state, `hashing[a[0]]` is `0` (whether `a[0]` was previously in `hashing` or not). Therefore, `ans` remains `0`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `0`, `ans` is `0`, `hashing[a[0]]` is `0`**.
