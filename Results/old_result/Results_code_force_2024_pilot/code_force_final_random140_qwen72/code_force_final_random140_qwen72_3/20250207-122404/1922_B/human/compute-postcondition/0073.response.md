Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `0`, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is `0` (if `a[0]` was not previously in `hashing`), or `hashing[a[0]]` is incremented by `0` (if `a[0]` was already in `hashing`).** 

Explanation:
- The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[0]]` because `i` is `0`.
- If `a[0]` was not previously in `hashing`, `hashing[a[0]]` is set to `0`.
- If `a[0]` was already in `hashing`, `hashing[a[0]]` is incremented by `0`, which means its value remains unchanged.
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
