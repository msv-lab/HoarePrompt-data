Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element `[int(data[current_index - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 5`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

Explanation:
- `current_index` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `2 * n + 5`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `results`, `i`, `ans`, `hashing`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
