The code snippet `b += s[i] < t[i]` increments `b` by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the condition checks if `s[2]` is less than `t[2]`.

- If `s[2]` is less than `t[2]`, `b` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[2]` is not less than `t[2]`, `b` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is greater than `t[2]`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is less than `t[2]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**
