The code `b += s[i] < t[i]` increments `b` by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the comparison `s[1] < t[1]` is evaluated. If `s[1]` is less than `t[1]`, `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. The value of `a` and the condition for incrementing `a` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is greater than `t[1]`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is less than `t[1]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**
