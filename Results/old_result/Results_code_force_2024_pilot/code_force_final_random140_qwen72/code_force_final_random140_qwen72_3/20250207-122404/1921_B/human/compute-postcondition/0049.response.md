The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of boxes, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, consisting of '0's and '1's, representing the initial and final positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns the minimum number of moves required to change the positions of the cats from the initial state `s` to the final state `f` for each test case. Each move consists of changing the position of one cat from one box to another.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f`. It returns the minimum number of moves required to change the positions of the cats from the initial state `s` to the final state `f` for each of the `t` test cases.**
