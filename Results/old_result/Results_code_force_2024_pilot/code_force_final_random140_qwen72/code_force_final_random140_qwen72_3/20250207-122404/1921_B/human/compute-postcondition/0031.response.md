To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(a, b))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer, representing the length of the strings `s` and `t`.
   - `s` and `t` are input strings of length `n`.
   - `a` is the count of positions where the character in `s` is greater than the corresponding character in `t`.
   - `b` is the count of positions where the character in `s` is less than the corresponding character in `t`.
   - `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the strings `s` and `t`.

2. **Understanding `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` and `b` are counts of character comparisons between `s` and `t`.
   - For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `s[i] > t[i]`, then `a` is incremented.
   - If `s[i] < t[i]`, then `b` is incremented.
   - If `s[i] == t[i]`, neither `a` nor `b` is incremented.

3. **Max of `a` and `b`:**
   - The `max(a, b)` function returns the larger of the two counts.
   - This value represents the number of positions where one string consistently has characters that are either greater or less than the corresponding characters in the other string.

Given this understanding, the `print(max(a, b))` statement will print the maximum of the two counts `a` and `b`.

Output: **max(a, b) (where a is the count of positions where the character in s is greater than the corresponding character in t, and b is the count of positions where the character in s is less than the corresponding character in t)**
