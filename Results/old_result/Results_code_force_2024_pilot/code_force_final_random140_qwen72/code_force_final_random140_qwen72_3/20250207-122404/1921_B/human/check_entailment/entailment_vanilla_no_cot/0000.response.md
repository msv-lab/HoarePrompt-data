Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by calculating the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `t`. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s`, and the desired state `t`.
3. **Counting Operations**:
   - `a` counts the number of positions where `s[i]` is '1' and `t[i]` is '0'. This represents the number of cats that need to be removed.
   - `b` counts the number of positions where `s[i]` is '0' and `t[i]` is '1'. This represents the number of cats that need to be added.
4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum of `a` and `b`, which is the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state.

The logic is sound because:
- Removing a cat and adding a cat are independent operations.
- Moving a cat from one box to another can be considered as a combination of removing a cat and adding a cat.
- Therefore, the minimum number of operations is determined by the larger of the two counts (`a` and `b`).

Thus, the program correctly computes the minimum number of operations for each test case.
