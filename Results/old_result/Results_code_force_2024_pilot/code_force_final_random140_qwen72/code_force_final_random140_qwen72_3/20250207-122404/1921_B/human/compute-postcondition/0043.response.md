The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is greater than `t[1]`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is less than `t[1]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged**
