Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is greater than `t[1]`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is less than `t[0]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` increments `a` by 1 if the element at index `i` (which is 1) in `s` is greater than the element at the same index in `t`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The other conditions in the initial state remain valid.
