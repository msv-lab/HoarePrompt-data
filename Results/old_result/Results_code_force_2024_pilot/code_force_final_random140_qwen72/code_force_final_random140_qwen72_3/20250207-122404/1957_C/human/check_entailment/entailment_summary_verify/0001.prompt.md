You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(x):
    dp = {}

    return helper(x)

#Function 2:
def helper(len):
    if len <= 0:
        return 1
    if len in dp:
        return dp[len]
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The `helper` function takes a non-negative integer `len` as input and returns an integer value. If `len` is 0, the function returns 1. If `len` is a positive integer and exists as a key in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value associated with `len` in `dp`. If `len` is a positive integer and not in `dp`, the function computes a new value `y` as the sum of the results of `helper(len - 1)` and `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`, stores this value in `dp` with the key `len`, and then returns `y`. The function effectively memoizes intermediate results to optimize recursive calls.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The player and the computer take turns, with the player placing a white rook and the computer placing a black rook in a mirrored position.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a dynamic programming (DP) dictionary and calls the helper function `helper`.
   - The helper function `helper` uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case for the recursion is when `len` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 1 (since there is exactly one way to place zero rooks).
   - For non-base cases, the function calculates the number of ways to place rooks using the recurrence relation:
     - `x1 = helper(len - 1)` represents the number of ways to place rooks without placing a rook in the current position.
     - `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` represents the number of ways to place rooks with a rook in the current position and another rook in a non-attacking position.
     - The total number of ways is the sum of these two cases, stored in `y`.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - The `helper` function correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board of length `len`.
   - The memoization ensures that the function does not recompute values for the same `len`, improving efficiency.
   - The `func_1` function correctly initializes the DP dictionary and calls the `helper` function with the appropriate input.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The base case for `len <= 0` is handled correctly.
   - The recurrence relation is correctly implemented to account for both placing and not placing a rook in the current position.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The problem requires the result to be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). However, the given code does not include this modulo operation. This is a critical oversight because the result can be very large, and without the modulo, the function may return incorrect results for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is almost correct but lacks the necessary modulo operation to handle large results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
