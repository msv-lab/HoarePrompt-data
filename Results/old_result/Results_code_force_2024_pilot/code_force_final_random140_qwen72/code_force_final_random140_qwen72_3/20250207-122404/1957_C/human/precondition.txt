x is a list containing the test cases, where each test case is a list with the first element being a list of two integers [n, k] representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, and the subsequent elements being lists of two integers [r_i, c_i] representing the moves made. Each n and k satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each r_i and c_i are valid positions on the n × n chessboard. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
