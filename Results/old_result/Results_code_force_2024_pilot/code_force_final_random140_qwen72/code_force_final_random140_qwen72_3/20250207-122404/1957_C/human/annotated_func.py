#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(x):
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the result of the function `helper(x)`, where `x` is a non-negative integer and `dp` is an empty dictionary. Since the function `helper` is not defined in the provided code, the exact output cannot be determined without the definition of `helper`. However, the return value will be whatever `helper(x)` computes based on the input `x` and possibly using the dictionary `dp` for memoization or other purposes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns the result of calling another function `helper(x)`. The function `helper` is expected to use an empty dictionary `dp` for its operations, though the exact behavior and output of `helper` are not specified in the provided code. The final state of the program includes the return value from `helper(x)`, which depends on the implementation of `helper`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem.
def helper(len):
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem, and len is greater than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value associated with the key `len` in the dictionary `dp`. Since `len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and is a key in `dp`, the returned value is the specific value stored in `dp` for the key `len`.
    #State: *`len` is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem, and `len` is greater than 0, and `len` is not in `dp`
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns the value of `y`, which is the sum of `x1` and `x2`. Here, `x1` is the return value of `helper(len - 1)`, and `x2` is 2 times `(len - 1)` times the return value of `helper(len - 2)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The `helper` function takes a non-negative integer `len` as input and returns an integer value. If `len` is 0, the function returns 1. If `len` is a positive integer and exists as a key in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value associated with `len` in `dp`. If `len` is a positive integer and not in `dp`, the function computes a new value `y` as the sum of the results of `helper(len - 1)` and `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`, stores this value in `dp` with the key `len`, and then returns `y`. The function effectively memoizes intermediate results to optimize recursive calls.
