Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a chessboard where players alternately place rooks in a mirrored fashion, ensuring no two rooks attack each other. The goal is to count the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is correctly handled by reading the number of test cases and the details of each test case, including the size of the board and the initial moves.

3. **Initial Moves Processing**: The program correctly processes the initial moves by reducing the available positions on the board based on whether the move is mirrored or not. This is done by decrementing `n` appropriately for each move.

4. **Dynamic Programming Function (`func_1` and `helper`)**:
   - `func_1` initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and calls `helper` with the updated value of `n`.
   - `helper` is a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. It correctly handles base cases and recursive cases, ensuring that the number of valid configurations is computed efficiently.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints properly.

Correctness: **True**
