### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The player and the computer take turns, with the player placing a white rook and the computer placing a black rook in a mirrored position.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a dynamic programming (DP) dictionary and calls the helper function `helper`.
   - The helper function `helper` uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case for the recursion is when `len` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 1 (since there is exactly one way to place zero rooks).
   - For non-base cases, the function calculates the number of ways to place rooks using the recurrence relation:
     - `x1 = helper(len - 1)` represents the number of ways to place rooks without placing a rook in the current position.
     - `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` represents the number of ways to place rooks with a rook in the current position and another rook in a non-attacking position.
     - The total number of ways is the sum of these two cases, stored in `y`.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - The `helper` function correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board of length `len`.
   - The memoization ensures that the function does not recompute values for the same `len`, improving efficiency.
   - The `func_1` function correctly initializes the DP dictionary and calls the `helper` function with the appropriate input.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The base case for `len <= 0` is handled correctly.
   - The recurrence relation is correctly implemented to account for both placing and not placing a rook in the current position.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The problem requires the result to be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). However, the given code does not include this modulo operation. This is a critical oversight because the result can be very large, and without the modulo, the function may return incorrect results for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is almost correct but lacks the necessary modulo operation to handle large results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
