The function `helper` is called with the argument `len - 1`. Since `len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len - 1` is also a non-negative integer. The value of `x1` is set to whatever `helper(len - 1)` returns. The variable `len` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0 and not in `dp`.

Output State: **`len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len` is not in `dp`, `x1` is the return value of `helper(len - 1)`**.
