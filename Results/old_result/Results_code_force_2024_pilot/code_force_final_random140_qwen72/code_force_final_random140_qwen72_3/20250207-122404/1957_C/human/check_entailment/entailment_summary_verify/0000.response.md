### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not align with the problem description. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning behind the original assessment:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard, considering the specific rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer.
   - The rules include ensuring no two rooks attack each other and the computer mirroring the player's moves unless the move is on the diagonal.

2. **Provided Program**:
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `helper`.
   - `func_1` simply calls `helper` with the input `x`.
   - `helper` is a recursive function that uses dynamic programming to compute a value based on the input `len`.

3. **Function `helper` Analysis**:
   - The `helper` function computes a value using a recurrence relation: `y = helper(len - 1) + 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`.
   - This recurrence relation does not correspond to the rules of placing rooks on a chessboard or the mirroring behavior described in the problem.
   - The function is designed to solve a different problem, possibly related to counting permutations or combinations, but not the specific rook placement problem.

4. **Alignment with Problem Description**:
   - The provided program does not implement any logic for placing rooks on a chessboard.
   - It does not check for valid moves or handle the mirroring behavior of the computer.
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `helper` is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the given problem and is therefore incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
