Output State: **`len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len` is in `dp`, `dp[len]` is `x1` + `x2`, `x1` is the return value of `helper(len - 1)`, `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * the return value of `helper(len - 2)`, `y` is `x1` + `x2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y` to `dp[len]`. Since `y` is calculated as `x1` + `x2`, and `x1` and `x2` are defined as the return values of `helper(len - 1)` and `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` respectively, the updated state reflects these assignments. The condition that `len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and that `len` is now in `dp` remains true.
