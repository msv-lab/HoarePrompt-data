The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns the result of calling another function `helper(x)`. The function `helper` is expected to use an empty dictionary `dp` for its operations, though the exact behavior and output of `helper` are not specified in the provided code. The final state of the program includes the return value from `helper(x)`, which depends on the implementation of `helper`.
