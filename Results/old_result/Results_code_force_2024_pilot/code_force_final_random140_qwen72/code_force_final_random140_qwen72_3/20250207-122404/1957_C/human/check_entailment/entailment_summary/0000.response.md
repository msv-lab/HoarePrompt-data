### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You start by placing a white rook, and the computer mirrors your move by placing a black rook at the transposed position (c, r).
   - If the move is on the diagonal (r = c), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the initial moves and updates the board size `n` based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and calls the `helper` function with the updated board size `n`.

4. **Function `helper`**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on a board of length `len`.
   - It uses memoization to store previously computed results in the `dp` dictionary.
   - The base case is when `len` is 0, in which case it returns 1 (no rooks can be placed).
   - For positive `len`, it computes the result as the sum of:
     - The number of ways to place rooks on a board of length `len - 1` (placing a rook in the last row/column).
     - Twice the number of ways to place rooks on a board of length `len - 2` (placing two rooks in the last two rows/columns).

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the initial moves and updates the board size accordingly.
   - The `helper` function correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid configurations.
   - The memoization ensures that the function runs efficiently even for large values of `n`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
