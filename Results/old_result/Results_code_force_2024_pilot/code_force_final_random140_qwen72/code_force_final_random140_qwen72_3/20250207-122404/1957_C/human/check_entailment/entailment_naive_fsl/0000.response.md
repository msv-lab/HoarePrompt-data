Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires a solution to count the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard, considering the specific rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `helper` do not implement any logic related to placing rooks on a chessboard or checking for valid moves. Instead, they seem to be implementing a dynamic programming approach to calculate a value based on the length parameter, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

For example, the function `helper` recursively calculates values based on previous results stored in a dictionary `dp`, but this calculation does not correspond to the rules of placing rooks on a chessboard or the mirroring behavior described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
