To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of iterations it takes for `x` to become 1.
- `X` is an integer where \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\).
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is \(100000000 - (\text{number of even iterations})\).
- `min` is \(-100000000 + (\text{number of odd iterations})\).
- `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` in reverse order of their updates, ending with the last value that made `x` equal to 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` starts at 1.
   - `i` starts at 0.
   - `t` is initialized to 0 (since it counts the number of iterations).

2. **Iteration Process**:
   - Since `x` is already 1, no iterations are needed to make `x` equal to 1.
   - Therefore, `t` remains 0.

3. **Variables**:
   - `max` and `min` are not updated because there are no iterations.
   - `ans` is not updated because there are no iterations.

### Conclusion:
- The number of iterations `t` is 0 because `x` is already 1 from the start.

### Output:
Output: **0**
