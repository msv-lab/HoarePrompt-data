The code snippet concatenates the string representation of `max` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Let's evaluate the impact:

- `max` is either 99999999 (if `x` is even) or 100000000 (if `x` is odd).
- `ans` is either "100000000" (if `x` is even) or "-100000000" (if `x` is odd).

If `x` is even:
- `max` is 99999999.
- `ans` is "100000000".
- After the code execution, `ans` becomes "99999999 100000000".

If `x` is odd:
- `max` is 100000000.
- `ans` is "-100000000".
- After the code execution, `ans` becomes "100000000 -100000000".

The values of `t`, `X`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even or 100000000 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd or -100000000 if `x` is even, `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` is even or "100000000 -100000000" if `x` is odd.**
