The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is the integer part of the division. Since `x` is an integer and its value is between 2 and 10^18, the new value of `x` will be half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is -100000000 or -99999999, and `ans` is one of the following: "99999998 99999999 100000000", "99999999 100000000 -100000000", "99999999 -100000000 100000000", or "100000000 -99999999 -100000000" depending on the value of `x`.**
