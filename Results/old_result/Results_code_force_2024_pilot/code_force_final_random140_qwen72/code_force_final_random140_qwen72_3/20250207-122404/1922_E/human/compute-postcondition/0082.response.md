To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while x != 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the condition `x != 1` is true. This means that `x` must not be equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is 0
- `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18
- `i` is 2
- `x` is the input integer
- `max` is 100000000
- `min` is -100000000
- `ans` is an empty string

The only variable in the loop head is `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must not be equal to 1. Since `x` is the input integer, we need to ensure that `x` is not 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `x` is not 1. The simplest way to do this is to specify that `x` must be any integer except 1.

State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is an empty string**
