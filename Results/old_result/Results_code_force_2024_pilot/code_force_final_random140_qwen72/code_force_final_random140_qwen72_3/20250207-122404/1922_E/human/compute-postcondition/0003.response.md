Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000.** 

The value of `min` has been updated to -100000000, while the other variables (`t`, `X`, `i`, `x`, and `max`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
