Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is an even integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '-100000000 '**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, making it an even integer. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `x` must not be 1 is still valid because `x` was initially an odd integer and not 1, and subtracting 1 from an odd integer results in an even integer, which cannot be 1.
