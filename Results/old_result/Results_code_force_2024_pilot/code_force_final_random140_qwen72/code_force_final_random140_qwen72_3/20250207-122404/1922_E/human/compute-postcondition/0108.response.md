The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` is -99999999, so after the increment, `min` becomes -99999998. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is either `"-99999999 99999999 100000000"`, `"-99999999 -100000000 100000000"`, `"-99999999 100000000 -100000000"`, or `"-99999999 -99999999 -100000000"`.**
