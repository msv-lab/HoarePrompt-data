The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters: `t` and `X`. Here, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18. The output of the function is not specified, so I cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, based on typical programming practices, the function likely performs some operation using `t` and `X` and returns a result.

Since the specific output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `X`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18. The function performs an unspecified operation using these parameters and returns a result.**
