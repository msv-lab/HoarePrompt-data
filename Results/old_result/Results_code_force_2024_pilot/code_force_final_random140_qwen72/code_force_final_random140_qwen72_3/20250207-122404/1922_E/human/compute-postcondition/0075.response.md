To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `X` is an integer where \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\).
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is \(100000000 - \text{number of even divisions performed}\).
- `min` is \(-100000000 + \text{number of odd decrements performed}\).
- `ans` is a string of numbers starting from the final value of `max` or `min` (depending on whether the last operation was a division or decrement) and ending with 100000000 or -100000000 (depending on the initial parity of `x`).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `x` starts at 1.
   - `i` starts at 1.
   - `X` is an integer within the specified range.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs until `x` becomes 1. Since `x` is already 1, the loop does not execute any iterations.
   - Therefore, `t` (the number of iterations) is 0.

3. **Calculations**:
   - Since no operations are performed on `x`, no even divisions or odd decrements occur.
   - `max` remains \(100000000 - 0 = 100000000\).
   - `min` remains \(-100000000 + 0 = -100000000\).

4. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - Since `x` is 1 initially and no operations are performed, the last operation is considered a "no-op".
   - The initial parity of `x` is 1 (odd), so the sequence should start from `min` and end at -100000000.
   - Therefore, `ans` is a string of numbers from -100000000 to 100000000.

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the sequence of numbers from -100000000 to 100000000, separated by spaces.

Output: **-100000000 -99999999 -99999998 ... 99999998 99999999 100000000**
