The value of `ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `max` (which is "100000000") with a space and the current value of `ans` (which is an empty string). The other variables (`t`, `X`, `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 1 and `x` is even, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000 ".**
