The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000 (or -99999999 depending on the parity of `X`), `ans` is "99999999 100000000" (or "99999999 -100000000" depending on the parity of `X`).**
