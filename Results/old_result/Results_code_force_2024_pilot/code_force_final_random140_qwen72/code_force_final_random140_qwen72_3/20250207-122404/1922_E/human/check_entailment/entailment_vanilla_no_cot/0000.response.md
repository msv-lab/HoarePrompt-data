Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases for generating an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. Here are the issues:

1. The logic for constructing the array is flawed. The approach of alternating between adding the maximum and minimum values based on whether `x` is even or odd does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
2. The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to construct such an array, which is required by the problem statement.
3. The program does not ensure that the length of the array is at most 200, as specified in the problem constraints.
4. The program does not correctly initialize the output string `ans` to handle the case when `x` is initially 1, which should result in a single-element array.
5. The program does not check if the constructed array meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences, which is crucial for correctness.

A correct solution would need to carefully construct the array to ensure it meets the problem requirements, including handling edge cases and ensuring the array length is within the specified limit.
