Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0. If `X` is even, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `X` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000". Additionally, if `X` is odd, `X` is updated to `X - 1`.***
