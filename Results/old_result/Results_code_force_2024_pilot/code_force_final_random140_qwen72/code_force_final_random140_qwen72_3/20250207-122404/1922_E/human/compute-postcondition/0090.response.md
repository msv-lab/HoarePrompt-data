Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an even integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '-100000000'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is decremented by 1, changing it from an odd integer to an even integer.
- All other variables (`t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and the bounds for `max` and `min` remain valid.
- The value of `ans` remains '-100000000'.
