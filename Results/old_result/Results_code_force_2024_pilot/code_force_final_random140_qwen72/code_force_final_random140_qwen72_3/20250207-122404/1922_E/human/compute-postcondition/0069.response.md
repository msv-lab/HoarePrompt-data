The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` depends on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `min` was `-100000000`, and now it becomes `-99999999`. If `x` is odd, `min` was `-99999998`, and now it becomes `-99999997`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even or 100000000 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even or -99999997 if `x` is odd, and `ans` is "-100000000 99999999 100000000" if `x` is even or "-99999998 -99999999 -100000000" if `x` is odd.**
