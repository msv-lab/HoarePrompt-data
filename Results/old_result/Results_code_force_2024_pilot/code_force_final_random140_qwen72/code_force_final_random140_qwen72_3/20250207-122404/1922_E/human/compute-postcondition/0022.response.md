The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` depends on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `min` is initially `-100000000`, and if `x` is odd, `min` is initially `-99999999`. After incrementing `min` by 1, the new value of `min` will be `-99999999` if `x` is even, or `-99999998` if `x` is odd. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000 if `x` is odd or 99999999 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even or -99999998 if `x` is odd, `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if `x` is even or "-99999999 -100000000" if `x` is odd.**
