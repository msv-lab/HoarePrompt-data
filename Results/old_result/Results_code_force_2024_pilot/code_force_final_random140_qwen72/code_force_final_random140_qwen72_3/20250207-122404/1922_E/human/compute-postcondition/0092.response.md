The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `t` was 0, so after the increment, `t` becomes 1. The values of `X`, `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "100000000 ". If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is '-100000000'.**
