Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '-100000000 ', and `x` is odd.** 

The value of `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `min` (which is `-100000000`) followed by a space and the original value of `ans` (which was an empty string). All other variables remain unchanged.
