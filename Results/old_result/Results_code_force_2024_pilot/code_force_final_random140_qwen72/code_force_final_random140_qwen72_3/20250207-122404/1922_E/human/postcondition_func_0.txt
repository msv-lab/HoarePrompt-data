The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `x` (where 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18). For each `x`, it generates a sequence of numbers by repeatedly dividing `x` by 2 if it is even or decrementing `x` by 1 if it is odd until `x` becomes 1. During this process, it alternates between appending the current maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) values to a string `ans`, adjusting `max` and `min` accordingly. After processing each `x`, it prints the total number of steps taken (`t`) and the generated sequence `ans`. The function does not return any value.
