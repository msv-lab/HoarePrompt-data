Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations it takes for `x` to become 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even iterations), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd iterations), `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` in reverse order of their updates, ending with the last value that made `x` equal to 1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` will be the total number of iterations it took for `x` to reach 1.
- The variable `X` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `x` will be 1 after the loop completes.
- The variable `max` will be reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop.
- The variable `min` will be increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop.
- The variable `ans` will contain a sequence of numbers, starting with the final value that made `x` equal to 1, followed by alternating values of `max` and `min` in reverse order of their updates. Each even `x` results in appending the current `max` value to `ans`, and each odd `x` results in appending the current `min` value to `ans`.
