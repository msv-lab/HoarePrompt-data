The value of `min` is incremented by 1. Depending on whether `x` is even or odd, the initial value of `min` is different, so the updated value of `min` will also differ.

- If `x` is even, `min` was initially `-100000000`, so after incrementing, `min` becomes `-99999999`.
- If `x` is odd, `min` was initially `-99999999`, so after incrementing, `min` becomes `-99999998`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000 ". If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".**
