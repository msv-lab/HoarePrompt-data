To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.
- `X` is an integer where \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\).
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is \(100000000 - (\text{number of even } x \text{ values encountered})\).
- `min` is \(-100000000 + (\text{number of odd } x \text{ values encountered})\).
- `ans` is a string of alternating `max` and `min` values in reverse order of their assignment, with the final value being either `max` or `min` depending on whether the last `x` value before reaching 1 was even or odd.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` starts at 1.
   - `i` starts at 2.
   - `X` is an integer within the specified range.
   - `t` is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, but since `x` is already 1, `t` is 0.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Since `x` is already 1, no iterations are needed to reduce `x` to 1. Therefore, `t` remains 0.
   - No even or odd `x` values are encountered during the process because `x` is already 1.

3. **Calculation of `max` and `min`**:
   - `max` is \(100000000 - 0 = 100000000\) because no even `x` values were encountered.
   - `min` is \(-100000000 + 0 = -100000000\) because no odd `x` values were encountered.

4. **Construction of `ans`**:
   - Since `x` is already 1, the last `x` value before reaching 1 is 1, which is odd.
   - Therefore, the final value in `ans` will be `min`.

5. **String Construction**:
   - `ans` will be a string of alternating `max` and `min` values, but since no iterations occurred, `ans` will only contain the final value, which is `min`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the value of `min`, which is \(-100000000\).

Output: **-100000000**
