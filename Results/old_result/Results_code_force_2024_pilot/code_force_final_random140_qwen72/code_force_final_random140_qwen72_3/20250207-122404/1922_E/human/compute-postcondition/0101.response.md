Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, and `x` is updated based on whether it is even or odd. If `x` is even, `x` is updated to `x // 2`, and `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` is odd, `x` is updated to `x - 1`, and `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "100000000 -100000000". If the original `x` was even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000". If the original `x` was odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".***
