Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 or -99999998 depending on the parity of `X`, `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if `X` is even or "-99999999 -100000000" if `X` is odd.**

Explanation:
- The value of `min` is incremented by 1.
- If `X` is even, `min` was initially -100000000, so now `min` is -99999999.
- If `X` is odd, `min` was initially -99999999, so now `min` is -99999998.
- All other variables (`t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
