The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` is an integer and must not be 1, after decrementing, `x` will be an integer that is not 0. The values of `t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

If `x` was even before the decrement, it is now odd. If `x` was odd before the decrement, it is now even. This change in the parity of `x` affects the values of `max`, `min`, and `ans`.

- If `x` was even (and thus `max` was 99999999, `min` was -99999999, and `ans` was "-100000000 100000000 "), `x` is now odd, so `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".
- If `x` was odd (and thus `max` was 100000000, `min` was -99999998, and `ans` was "-99999999 -100000000"), `x` is now even, so `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000".

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1 or 0, `max` is 100000000 if `x` was odd, otherwise `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000" if `x` was odd, otherwise `ans` is "-100000000 100000000".**
