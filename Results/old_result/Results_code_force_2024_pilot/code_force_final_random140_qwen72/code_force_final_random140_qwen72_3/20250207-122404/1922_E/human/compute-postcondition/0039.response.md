Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations it takes for `x` to become 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even iterations), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd iterations), `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` in reverse order of their updates, ending with the last value that made `x` equal to 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which must be greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
