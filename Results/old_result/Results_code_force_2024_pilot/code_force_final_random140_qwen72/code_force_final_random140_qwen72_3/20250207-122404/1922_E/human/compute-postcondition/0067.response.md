The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`. Since `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, and the operation `x // 2` performs integer division, `x` is now half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000" if `x` was even before the operation; otherwise, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "100000000 -99999999 -100000000" if `x` was odd before the operation.**
