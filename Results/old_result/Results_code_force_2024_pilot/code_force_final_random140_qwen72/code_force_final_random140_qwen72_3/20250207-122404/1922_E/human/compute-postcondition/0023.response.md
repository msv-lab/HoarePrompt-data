Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is `x - 1`, `max` is 100000000 if `x` (after decrement) is odd or 99999999 if `x` (after decrement) is even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` (after decrement) is even or -99999998 if `x` (after decrement) is odd, `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if `x` (after decrement) is even or "-99999999 -100000000" if `x` (after decrement) is odd.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` depend on the new value of `x` after the decrement. The conditions for `max`, `min`, and `ans` are updated based on whether the new value of `x` is even or odd. All other variables remain unchanged.
