You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = ''
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `x` (where 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18). For each `x`, it generates a sequence of numbers by repeatedly dividing `x` by 2 if it is even or decrementing `x` by 1 if it is odd until `x` becomes 1. During this process, it alternates between appending the current maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) values to a string `ans`, adjusting `max` and `min` accordingly. After processing each `x`, it prints the total number of steps taken (`t`) and the generated sequence `ans`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \(X\) is a large odd number correctly. For example, consider \(X = 1000000000000000001\). According to the program, it will keep subtracting 1 from \(X\) and adding the minimum value to the array until \(X\) becomes even. However, this process will take a very long time and may exceed the limit of 200 elements in the array. Additionally, the program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, which is a requirement in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
