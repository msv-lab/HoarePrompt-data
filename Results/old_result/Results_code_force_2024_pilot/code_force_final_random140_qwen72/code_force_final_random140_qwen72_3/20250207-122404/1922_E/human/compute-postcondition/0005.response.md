Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is set to 0, overriding its initial value within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. All other variables (`X`, `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
