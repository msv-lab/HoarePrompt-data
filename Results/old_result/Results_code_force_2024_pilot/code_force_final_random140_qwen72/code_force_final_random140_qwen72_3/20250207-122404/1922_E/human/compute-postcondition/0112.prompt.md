Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "100000000 ". If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is '-100000000'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is updated based on whether it is even or odd. If `x` is even, `x` is updated to `x // 2`, and `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` is odd, `x` is updated to `x - 1`, and `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "100000000 -100000000". If the original `x` was even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000". If the original `x` was odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is updated to `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is -100000000 or -99999999, and `ans` is one of the following: "99999998 99999999 100000000", "99999999 100000000 -100000000", "99999999 -100000000 100000000", or "100000000 -99999999 -100000000" depending on the value of `x`. If `x` is odd, `x` is updated to `X - 1`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is one of the following: "-99999999 99999999 100000000", "-99999999 -100000000 100000000", "-99999999 100000000 -100000000", or "-99999999 -99999999 -100000000" depending on the value of `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
