Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning. If `n` is 2, `i` is `n-1` and `ans` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-2`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) is greater than 1, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, if all differences between consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) are less than or equal to 1, `ans` is 0.**
