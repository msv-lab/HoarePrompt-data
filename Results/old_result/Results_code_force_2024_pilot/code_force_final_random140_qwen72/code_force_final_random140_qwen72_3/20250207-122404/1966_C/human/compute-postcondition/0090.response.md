Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `s` contains all elements of `arr`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains the same as it was initially. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index that the loop iterates over. The set `s` will contain all the elements from the list `arr`, as each element of `arr` is added to `s` during the loop's execution.
