Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 3. If the difference between `s[3]` and `s[2]` is greater than 1, `ans` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.***
