The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n`, representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function should handle up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given context. However, based on typical problem statements, the function likely returns some form of analysis or computation result based on the input data for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
