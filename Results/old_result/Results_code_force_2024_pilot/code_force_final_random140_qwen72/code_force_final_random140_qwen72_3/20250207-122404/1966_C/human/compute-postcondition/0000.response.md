The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range specified by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value corresponds to the number of test cases, `t`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state should reflect that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
