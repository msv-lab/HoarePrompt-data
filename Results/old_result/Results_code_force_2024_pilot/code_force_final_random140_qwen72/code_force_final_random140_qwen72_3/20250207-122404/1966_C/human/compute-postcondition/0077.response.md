Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is set to 1.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from a new input.
- `s` is a list that contains all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning.
- `i` is set to `n-2`.
- The difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) is less than or equal to 1.
- `ans` is set to 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
