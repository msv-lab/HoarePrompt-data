Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is n-1, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the length of the list `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `n` is the number of unique elements in `arr` plus one (for the 0 at the beginning of `s`).
