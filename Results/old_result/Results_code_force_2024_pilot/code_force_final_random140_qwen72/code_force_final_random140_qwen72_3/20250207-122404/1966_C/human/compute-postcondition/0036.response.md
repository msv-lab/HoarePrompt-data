Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ans` is 1, indicating that the loop broke due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at some point during the iterations.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
