Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
- `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ans` is 1.
- The current value of `n` is 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
