Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` (sorted or unsorted depending on the original set), `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2 or if the loop broke due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at some point, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
