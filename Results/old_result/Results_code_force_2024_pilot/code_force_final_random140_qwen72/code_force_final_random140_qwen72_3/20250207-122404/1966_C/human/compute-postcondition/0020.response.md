To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n - 1)` contains at least one element. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `n > 2`).

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the length of `s`
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order
- `i` is n-1
- `ans` is 1
- `n` is not equal to 2

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2. Since `n` is already given as not equal to 2, we need to ensure it is greater than 2.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is used in the loop head, but it is initialized to `n-1` before the loop. We need to ensure that `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-2`.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than 2
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order
- `i` is 1 (since the loop starts with `i` in the range from 1 to `n-2`)
- `ans` is 1

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1**
