Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is 3. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.***
