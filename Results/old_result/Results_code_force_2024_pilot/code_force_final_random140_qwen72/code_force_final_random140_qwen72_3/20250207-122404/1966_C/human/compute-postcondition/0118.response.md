Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `s` (which is the length of `arr` + 1), `i` is `n-1` if `n` is 2, otherwise `i` is `n-2`. `s` is a list with 0 prepended to all elements of `arr`. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` will be 1 if the condition was true (no difference between consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1) or 0 if the condition was false (a difference between consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1).***
