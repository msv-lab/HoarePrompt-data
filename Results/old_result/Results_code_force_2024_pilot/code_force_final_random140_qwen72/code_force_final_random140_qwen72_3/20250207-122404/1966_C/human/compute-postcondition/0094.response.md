The code snippet `n = len(s)` updates the value of `n` to the length of the list `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a list with 0 prepended to all elements of `arr`. Since the length of `s` is now determined by the number of elements in `arr` plus one (for the prepended 0), `n` is updated to this new length. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `s` (which is the length of `arr` + 1), `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list with 0 prepended to all elements of `arr`, `ans` is 1.**
