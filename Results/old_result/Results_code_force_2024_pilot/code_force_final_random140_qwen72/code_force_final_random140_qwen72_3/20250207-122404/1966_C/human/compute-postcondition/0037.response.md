Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is n-1, `ans` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at any point during the iterations.**
