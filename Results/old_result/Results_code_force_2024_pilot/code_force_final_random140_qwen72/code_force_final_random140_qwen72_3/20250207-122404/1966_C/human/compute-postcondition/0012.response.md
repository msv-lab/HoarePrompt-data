The code `s = list(s)` converts the set `s` into a list and assigns it back to `s`. This means that `s` is now a list containing all unique elements from `arr`, preserving the uniqueness but losing the set properties (like fast membership testing).

Let's go through the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `_` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
   - `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`
   - `i` is n-1

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - `s` is converted from a set to a list. The elements remain the same, but the data structure changes.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `s` is now a list containing all unique elements from `arr`.

4. **Unchanged Values**:
   - `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
   - `_` remains 0
   - `n` remains an input integer
   - `arr` remains a list of integers derived from the input
   - `i` remains n-1

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements from `arr`, `i` is n-1.**
