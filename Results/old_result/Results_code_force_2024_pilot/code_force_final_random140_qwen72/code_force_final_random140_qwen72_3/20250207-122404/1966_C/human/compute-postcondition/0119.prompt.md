Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    ans = 1
    s = [0] + s
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans = 1 - ans
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is n-1. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, it indicates that the loop broke due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at some point during the iterations. If `ans` is 0, it indicates that the loop did not break due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at any point during the iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning. If `n` is 2, `i` is `n-1` and `ans` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-2`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) is greater than 1, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, if all differences between consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) are less than or equal to 1, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is the length of `s` (which is the length of `arr` + 1), `i` is `n-1` if `n` is 2, otherwise `i` is `n-2`. `s` is a list with 0 prepended to all elements of `arr`. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` will be 1 if the condition was true (no difference between consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1) or 0 if the condition was false (a difference between consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
