The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`**
