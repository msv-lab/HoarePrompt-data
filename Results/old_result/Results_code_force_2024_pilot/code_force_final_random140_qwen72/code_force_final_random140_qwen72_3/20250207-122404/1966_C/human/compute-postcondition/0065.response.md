To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
- `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning.
- `i` is 1.
- If the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` (which is 0) is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` remains 1.
- Otherwise, if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1, `ans` is set to 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

### Conclusion:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0 if the difference between `s[1]` and `s[0]` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 1**.
