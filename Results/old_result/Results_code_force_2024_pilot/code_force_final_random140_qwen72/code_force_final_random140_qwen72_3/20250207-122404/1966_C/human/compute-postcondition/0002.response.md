The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts (based on spaces), converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arr`.

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
