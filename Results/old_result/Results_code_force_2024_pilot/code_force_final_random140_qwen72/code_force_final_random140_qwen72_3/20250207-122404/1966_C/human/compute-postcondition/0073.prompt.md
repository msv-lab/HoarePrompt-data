Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1, and `n` is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans = 1 - ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` (which is 0) is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1, `ans` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 2. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the difference between `s[1]` and `s[0]` is less than or equal to 1, `ans` is 0. If the difference between `s[1]` and `s[0]` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 3. If the difference between `s[3]` and `s[2]` is greater than 1, `ans` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
