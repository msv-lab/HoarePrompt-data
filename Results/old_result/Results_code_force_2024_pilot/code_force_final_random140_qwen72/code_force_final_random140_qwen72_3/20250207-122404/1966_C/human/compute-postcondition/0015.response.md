The code snippet `s = [0] + s` prepends the integer `0` to the list `s`. This impacts the variable `s` by adding a new element at the beginning of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is n-1, `ans` is 1.**
