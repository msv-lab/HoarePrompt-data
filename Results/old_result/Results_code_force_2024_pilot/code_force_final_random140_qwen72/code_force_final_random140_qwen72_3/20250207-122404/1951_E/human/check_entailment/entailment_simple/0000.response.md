### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, we output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition is possible, we output "NO".

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.
   - It then performs several checks to determine if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Key Functions:**
   - **func_1(ch):** This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It splits the string into two halves and checks if the first half is the reverse of the second half.
   - **func_2(ch):** This function determines the type of partition needed based on the length and properties of the string.
     - It returns an integer indicating the type of partition required.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program first checks if the string `s` is a repeated character (e.g., "aaaa"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because no partition can be made.
   - It then checks if the string is a repeated pattern of two characters (e.g., "ababab"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False`.
   - If `T1` is still `True`, it calls `func_1` to check if the string itself is a palindrome.
   - Depending on the length and the result of `func_1`, it decides how to partition the string.
   - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like single-character strings and repeated patterns correctly.
   - It also handles the general case of partitioning longer strings into non-palindromic parts.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts (e.g., "lllllllll").
   - It correctly identifies when a string can be partitioned and provides a valid partition (e.g., "uwuowouwu").

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It checks for edge cases and general cases, and it outputs the correct results for both "YES" and "NO" scenarios.

**Correctness: **True****
