You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(ch):
    if (len(ch) % 2 == 0) :
        x = len(ch) // 2
    else :
        x = len(ch) // 2 + 1
    #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters. If the length of `ch` is even, `x` is half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is odd, `x` is equal to (length of `ch` // 2) + 1.
    if (ch[:len(ch) // 2] == ch[x:][::-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `ch`, which is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It checks whether the first half of the string is a mirror image of the second half (or vice versa, considering the middle character if the length is odd). If the string is a palindrome when split into two halves, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the input string `ch` remains unchanged, and the function has no side effects.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string of lowercase Latin characters.

    b = len(ch) // 2

        else :
            a = 2
        #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2, and the length of `ch` is odd. If `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, `a` is 1. Otherwise, `a` is 2.
    #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If the length of `ch` is even, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, if the length of `ch` is even, `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 1. Otherwise, if the length of `ch` is odd, `a` is 2.
    return a
    #The program returns 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the conditions: If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then it returns 3. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, then it returns 4. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then it returns 1. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, then it returns 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns an integer based on the length of `ch` and the result of calling `func_1` on the first half of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 3; if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 4. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 1; if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 2. The function does not modify the input string `ch`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
   - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function determines the minimum number of parts needed to partition a string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
   - It first calculates the midpoint of the string.
   - If the string length is even:
     - It checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If it is a palindrome, it sets `a` to 3 (indicating that at least 3 parts are needed).
     - If it is not a palindrome, it sets `a` to 4 (indicating that at least 4 parts are needed).
   - If the string length is odd:
     - It checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If it is a palindrome, it sets `a` to 1 (indicating that at least 1 part is needed).
     - If it is not a palindrome, it sets `a` to 2 (indicating that at least 2 parts are needed).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is missing from the provided code. We need to implement the main function that processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` and `func_2` to determine if a valid partition exists and to output the partition.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Main Logic**: The provided code only includes helper functions (`func_1` and `func_2`). The main logic for processing test cases and generating the required output is missing.
- **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is not correct for determining the minimum number of parts needed to ensure no part is a palindrome. The function should focus on finding a valid partition rather than just returning a fixed number of parts.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, check if the entire string is a palindrome.
- If the string is not a palindrome, the entire string can be a single part.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to split it into the smallest possible non-palindromic parts.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and contains logical errors in the partitioning logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
