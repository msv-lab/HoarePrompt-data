Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. Here's why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. However, it only checks the first half against the reversed second half, which is incorrect for odd-length strings. It should check the entire string against its reverse.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to determine the number of parts needed to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome. However, the logic is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases. For example, it does not consider the possibility of splitting the string into more than two parts if necessary.

3. **Overall Logic**: The program does not provide a way to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings and print the results as required by the problem statement. It only returns a number, which is not sufficient to meet the output requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a function that can partition the string into non-palindromic substrings and handle all edge cases, including when the string itself is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned as required.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def partition_string(s):
    n = len(s)
    if n <= 1:
        return "NO"
    
    # Try to partition the string into non-palindromic parts
    if not is_palindrome(s):
        return "YES", 1, [s]
    
    # If the entire string is a palindrome, try to split it into two parts
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
            return "YES", 2, [s[:i], s[i:]]
    
    return "NO"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        s = data[index]
        result = partition_string(s)
        if result[0] == "NO":
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            results.append(str(result[1]))
            results.append(' '.join(result[2]))
        index += 1
    
    for line in results:
        print(line)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly checks if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the required output format.
