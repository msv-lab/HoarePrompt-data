Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if a string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. If possible, we need to output the partition details.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(ch)`**: This function checks if the first half of the string `ch` is a mirror image of the second half. It correctly identifies if a string is a palindrome when split into two halves.
   - **`func_2(ch)`**: This function determines the type of partition needed based on the length of the string and the result of `func_1` on the first half of the string. It returns an integer indicating the type of partition required.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates over each test case and performs the following steps:
     - Checks if the string is a repeated character (e.g., "aaaa"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False`.
     - Checks if the string is a specific pattern (e.g., "ababab"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False`.
     - If `T1` is still `True`, it calls `func_1` to check if the string itself is a palindrome.
     - Depending on the length of the string and the result of `func_1`, it calls `func_2` to determine the type of partition.
     - Based on the value of `a` returned by `func_2`, it attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
     - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" followed by the partition details. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as strings of length 1 or 2, which cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It also handles cases where the string is a repeated character or a specific pattern.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly identifies if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The partitioning logic is sound and covers various cases, including strings of different lengths and patterns.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
