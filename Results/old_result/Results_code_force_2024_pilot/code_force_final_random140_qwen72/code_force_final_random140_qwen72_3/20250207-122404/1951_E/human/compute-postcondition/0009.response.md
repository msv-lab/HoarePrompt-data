Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is odd, `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2, the result of `func_1(ch[:b])` is `True`, `a` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `a`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `a`.
