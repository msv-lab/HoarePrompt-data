Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to check if a string is a palindrome. However, the implementation is flawed. It only checks the first half of the string against the reversed second half, which is incorrect. A correct palindrome check should compare the entire string with its reverse. For example, `func_1("abcba")` should return `True`, but the current implementation might return `False` because it only checks `"ab"` against `"ba"`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the number of parts to partition the string, but it does not actually perform the partitioning. It returns a value based on whether the first half of the string is a palindrome, which is not sufficient to ensure that the entire string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, `func_2("abcba")` might return `1`, but this does not help in partitioning the string correctly.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over multiple test cases, which is correct.
   - The program checks if the string consists of the same character repeated (`s == s[0] * len(s)`), which is a good optimization to quickly identify palindromic strings.
   - However, the logic for determining if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings is flawed. For example, the condition `if T1 and func_1(s):` is incorrect because it assumes that if the entire string is a palindrome, it cannot be partitioned, which is not always true. For instance, the string `"abcba"` can be partitioned into `"ab"` and `"cba"`, both of which are not palindromes.
   - The program also lacks a clear and systematic approach to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. The conditions and logic used to set `a` and partition the string are overly complex and do not guarantee correctness.

4. **Specific Case**:
   - **Input**: `"lllllllll"`
   - **Expected Output**: 
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - **Actual Output**: The program does not produce the correct output because it lacks the necessary logic to handle this case. The program incorrectly assumes that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings without a proper check.

Given these issues, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
