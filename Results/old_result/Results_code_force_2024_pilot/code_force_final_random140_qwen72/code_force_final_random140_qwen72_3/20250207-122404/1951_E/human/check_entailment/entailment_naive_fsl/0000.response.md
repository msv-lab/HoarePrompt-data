Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully address the problem description. Specifically, they do not handle the partitioning of the string into non-palindromic substrings as required. Here are a few issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome, but it only checks the first half against the reversed second half, which is incorrect. A correct palindrome check should compare the entire string with its reverse.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the number of parts to partition the string, but it does not actually perform the partitioning. It also does not handle the case where the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Missing Logic**: The program does not include any logic to handle multiple test cases or to output the required "YES" or "NO" responses along with the partition details.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- **Input**: `"lllllllll"`
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output**: The program does not produce the correct output because it lacks the necessary logic to handle this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
