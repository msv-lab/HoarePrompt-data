### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
   - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to determine the minimum number of parts needed to partition a string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
   - It calculates the midpoint of the string and checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome using `func_1`.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed:
     - For even-length strings, it returns 3 if the first half is a palindrome and 4 if it is not.
     - For odd-length strings, it returns 1 if the first half is a palindrome and 2 if it is not.
   - These return values do not align with the problem requirements. The function should focus on finding a valid partition rather than just returning a fixed number of parts.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is indeed missing from the provided code. The main function should process multiple test cases and use `func_1` and `func_2` to determine if a valid partition exists and to output the partition.
   - The main function should:
     - Check if the entire string is a palindrome.
     - If the string is not a palindrome, the entire string can be a single part.
     - If the string is a palindrome, try to split it into the smallest possible non-palindromic parts.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Main Logic**: The provided code only includes helper functions (`func_1` and `func_2`). The main logic for processing test cases and generating the required output is missing.
- **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is not correct for determining the minimum number of parts needed to ensure no part is a palindrome. The function should focus on finding a valid partition rather than just returning a fixed number of parts.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, check if the entire string is a palindrome.
- If the string is not a palindrome, the entire string can be a single part.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to split it into the smallest possible non-palindromic parts.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and contains logical errors in the partitioning logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
