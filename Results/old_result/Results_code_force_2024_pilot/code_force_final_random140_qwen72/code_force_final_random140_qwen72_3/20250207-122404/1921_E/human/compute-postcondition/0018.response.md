Postcondition: ***`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. However, since the if condition `(y1 == y2)` is true, this implies that there is a contradiction with the precondition stating `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Therefore, the program cannot enter this if block under the given precondition.***
