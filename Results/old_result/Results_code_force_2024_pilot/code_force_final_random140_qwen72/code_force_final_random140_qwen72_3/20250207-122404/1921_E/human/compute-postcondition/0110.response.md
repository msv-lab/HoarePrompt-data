The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `answers`. If there are more elements in `answers`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first element in `answers`, and `answers` is a list containing at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least two elements. After the last iteration, `j` was the first element, so for the next iteration, `j` will be the second element in `answers`.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing at least two elements ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the second element in `answers`**
