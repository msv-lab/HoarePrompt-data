To determine what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `n` is `r[0]`.
   - `m` is `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`.
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
   - `y1` is either `r[3] - 1 - a` or `r[3] + 1 - a` depending on the initial value of `y1`.
   - `y2` is either 1 or `r[1]`.
   - `a` is either `r[1] - y2` or `y2 - 1` depending on the initial value of `y1`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number).
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `c` is either `y1 - 1` if the absolute difference between `y2` and 1 is less than the absolute difference between `y2` and `m`, or `c` is `m - y1` if the absolute difference between `y2` and 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `y2` and `m`.
   - At least one of the following conditions is true:
     - `b // 2 <= a`
     - `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
     - `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`
     - `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`

### Analysis:
- The `print('draw')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'draw'`.
- The initial state provides a complex set of conditions and variable definitions, but none of these affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print('draw')` statement will simply print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
