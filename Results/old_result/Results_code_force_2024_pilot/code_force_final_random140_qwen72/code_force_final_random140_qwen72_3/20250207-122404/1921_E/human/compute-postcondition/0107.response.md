Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, and `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' for each test case processed. The length of `answers` is equal to `test_cases`. Each element in `answers` corresponds to the result of the respective test case based on the conditions evaluated in the loop.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than the total number of test cases (`test_cases - 1`). The list `answers` will contain a result ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each test case, with the length of `answers` being exactly equal to `test_cases`. The specific content of `answers` depends on the input values provided for each test case, as determined by the conditions inside the loop.
