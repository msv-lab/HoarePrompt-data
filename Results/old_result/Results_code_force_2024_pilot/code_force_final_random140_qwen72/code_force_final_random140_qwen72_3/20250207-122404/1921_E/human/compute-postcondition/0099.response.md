The code snippet `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Since the initial state does not specify the existence or content of the `answers` list, we assume it is initialized before this line of code is executed. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user's input, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice'.**
