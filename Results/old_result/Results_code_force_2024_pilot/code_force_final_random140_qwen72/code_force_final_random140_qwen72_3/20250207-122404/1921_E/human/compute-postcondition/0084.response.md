Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but reads input values from the standard input, representing the dimensions of a board (n, m) and the initial positions of two chips (x1, y1 for Alice's chip, x2, y2 for Bob's chip). It determines the outcome of a game based on the relative positions of the chips and prints one of three possible results: 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'draw'. The function does not return any value. The game logic involves checking the parity of the distance between the chips and their relative positions to decide the winner or if the game ends in a draw. **
