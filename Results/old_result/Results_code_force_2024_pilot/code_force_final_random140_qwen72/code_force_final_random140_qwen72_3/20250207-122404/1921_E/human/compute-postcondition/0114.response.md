Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing exactly `test_cases` elements ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), and all elements in `answers` have been printed.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the specified range, `test_cases` is still the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is one less than `test_cases`, and the list `answers` contains exactly `test_cases` elements, each of which has been printed by the loop.
