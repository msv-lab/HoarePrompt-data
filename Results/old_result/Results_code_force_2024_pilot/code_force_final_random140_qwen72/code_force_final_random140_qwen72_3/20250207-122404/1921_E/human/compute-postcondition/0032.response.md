To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` is `r[0]`
   - `m` is `r[1]`
   - `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`
   - If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `y2 - 1`
   - Otherwise, `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - y2`
   - `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number)
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`

2. **Analysis:**
   - The condition `x2` is greater than `x1` is explicitly stated.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - The value of `a` depends on the relationship between `y1` and `y2`.
   - The conditions involving `x1` and `x2` (either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`) are contradictory to the earlier condition that `x2` is greater than `x1`.

Given these conditions, the only way the code can execute the `print('draw')` statement is if the conditions are met. Since the conditions are complex and interdependent, the most precise description of the output is based on the fact that the `print` statement is executed under the given conditions.

Output: **draw**
