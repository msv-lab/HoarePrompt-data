### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but it is not properly defined to accept parameters. Instead, it reads input values directly within the function.
   - The input is read correctly using `list(map(int, input().split()))` and assigned to variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`.

2. **Initial Draw Condition:**
   - The first condition checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because if Bob's chip is already in or above Alice's chip, neither can move into the other's position, leading to a draw.

3. **Odd Distance Case:**
   - If the difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd, the function checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns. This is correct because if the vertical distance is odd and the horizontal positions are the same, Alice can always move to Bob's position on her next turn.
   - If `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the function adjusts `x1` and `y1` to simulate a move and checks again if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns.
   - If the adjusted positions still do not match, the function calculates additional moves and checks if the game ends in a draw or if Alice can win.

4. **Even Distance Case:**
   - If the difference `(x2 - x1)` is even, the function checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Bob" and returns. This is correct because if the vertical distance is even and the horizontal positions are the same, Bob can always move to Alice's position on his next turn.
   - If `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the function adjusts `x1` and `y1` to simulate a move and checks if the game ends in a draw or if Bob can win.

5. **General Draw Conditions:**
   - The function includes several conditions to check if the game ends in a draw, such as when the chips cannot move into each other's positions or when they are out of bounds.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles the game logic and prints the appropriate result ("Alice", "Bob", or "Draw") based on the given conditions. The logic is sound and follows the rules of the game as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
