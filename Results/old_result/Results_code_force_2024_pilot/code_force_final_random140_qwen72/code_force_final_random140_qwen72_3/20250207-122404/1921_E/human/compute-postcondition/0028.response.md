The code snippet `t = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns this value to `t`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The value of `t` is now the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1`
- `x2` is `r[4]`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`
- If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `y2 - 1`
- Otherwise, `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - y2`
- `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number)

The new variable `t` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `y2 - 1`, otherwise `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**
