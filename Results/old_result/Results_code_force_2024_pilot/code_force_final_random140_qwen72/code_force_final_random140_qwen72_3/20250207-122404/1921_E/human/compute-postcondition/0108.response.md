To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects directly involved in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `j` and the list `answers`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`.
- `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' for each test case processed.
- The length of `answers` is equal to `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute, the list `answers` must contain at least one element. The variable `j` will take the value of each element in `answers` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, the list `answers` must have at least one element, and `j` should be the first element of `answers`.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing at least one element ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the first element in `answers`**
