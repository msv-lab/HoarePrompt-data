Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `y2 - 1`, otherwise `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y2` is `r[1]`, the absolute value of `y2 - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `y2 - m`.**

Explanation:
- `y2` is updated to `m` (which is `r[1]`).
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
