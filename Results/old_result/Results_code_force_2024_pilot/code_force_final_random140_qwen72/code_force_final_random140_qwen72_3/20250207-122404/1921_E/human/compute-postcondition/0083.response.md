Functionality: **The function `func_1` is intended to accept parameters for the board dimensions (h, w), the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b), and possibly the number of test cases (t). However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not return any value regardless of the input conditions.**
