To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` is `r[0]`: This means `n` is the first element of the list `r`.
   - `m` is `r[1]`: This means `m` is the second element of the list `r`.
   - `x1` is `x1 + a`: `x1` is updated by adding `a` to its original value.
   - `y1` is either 1 or `r[1]`: `y1` can be either 1 or the second element of the list `r`.
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`: `x2` is the fifth element of the list `r` minus `a`.
   - `y2` is updated to either `y2 - a` or `y2 + a`:
     - If `y2 >= y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`.
     - If `y2 < y1`, then `a` is `m - y1`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1` (a positive even number).
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on whether `abs(y1 - 1) < abs(y1 - m)` is true or false.
   - At least one of the following conditions is true:
     - `b // 2 <= a`
     - `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
     - `y1 < 1 or y1 > m`
     - `x1 < 1 or x1 > n`

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement simply outputs the string `'draw'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the print statement directly; they only describe the state of the variables and objects before the print statement is executed.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **draw**
