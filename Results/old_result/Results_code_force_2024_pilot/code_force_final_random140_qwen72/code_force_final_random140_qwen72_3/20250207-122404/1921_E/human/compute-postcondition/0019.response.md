The initial state provides several conditions and variable assignments, but it also includes a contradiction. Specifically, the precondition states that `y1` is not equal to `y2`, but then it says that the if condition `(y1 == y2)` is true. This contradiction means that the program cannot logically enter the if block under the given conditions.

Given this contradiction, the `print('Alice')` statement inside the if block will not be executed because the if condition `(y1 == y2)` cannot be true based on the precondition.

Therefore, the output of the program will be nothing, as the print statement is not executed.

Output: **(nothing)**
