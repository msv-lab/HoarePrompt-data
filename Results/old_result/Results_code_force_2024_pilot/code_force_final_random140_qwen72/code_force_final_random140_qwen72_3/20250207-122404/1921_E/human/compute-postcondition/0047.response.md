Postcondition: ***`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is either `r[3] - 1 - a` or `r[3] + 1 - a` depending on the initial value of `y1`, `y2` is either 1 or `r[1]`, `a` is either `r[1] - y2` or `y2 - 1` depending on the initial value of `y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `c` is either `y1 - 1` if the absolute difference between `y2` and 1 is less than the absolute difference between `y2` and `m`, or `c` is `m - y1` if the absolute difference between `y2` and 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `y2` and `m`. Additionally, at least one of the following conditions is true: `b // 2 <= a`, `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.***
