The code snippet `c = m - y1` assigns the value of `m - y1` to the variable `c`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `c` is now assigned the value of `m - y1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `b`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number
- `y1` is `y1 + a`
- `y2` is `r[1]`
- `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number)
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`
- The absolute value of `y2 - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `y2 - m`

After executing the code snippet:
- `c` is assigned the value `m - y1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is `y1 + a`, `y2` is `r[1]`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, the absolute value of `y2 - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `y2 - m`, `c` is `m - y1`.**
