The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'bob'`. The initial state provides several variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) and conditions about their relationships, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.

Given that the `print` statement only contains a static string, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **bob**
