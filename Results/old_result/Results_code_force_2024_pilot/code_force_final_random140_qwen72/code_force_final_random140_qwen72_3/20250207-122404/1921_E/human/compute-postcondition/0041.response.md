Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is `y1 + a`, `y2` is `r[1]`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, the absolute value of `y2 - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `y2 - m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y1` is updated to `y1 + a`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, `b`, `t`, `y2`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions related to the values of these variables and their relationships (such as `x2` being greater than `x1`, `x1` being greater than or equal to 1, etc.) remain valid.
