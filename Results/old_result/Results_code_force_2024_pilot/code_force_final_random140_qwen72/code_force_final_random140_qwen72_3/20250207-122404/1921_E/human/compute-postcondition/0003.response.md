Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2]`
- `y1` is `r[3]`
- `x2` is `r[4]`
- `y2` is `r[5]`
- `func_1` is not properly defined
- The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
