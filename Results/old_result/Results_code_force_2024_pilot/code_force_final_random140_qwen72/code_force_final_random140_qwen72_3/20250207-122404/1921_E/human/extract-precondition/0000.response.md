Precondition: **The function `func_1` is not properly defined for the given problem. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions (h, w), the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b), and possibly the number of test cases (t). For example:**
```
def game_outcome(t, test_cases):
```
Where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) for each test case. Each test case must satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.
