The code snippet `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Since `answers` was not previously defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `'Draw'`, `answers` will contain one element, which is the string `'Draw'`.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user's input, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'.**
