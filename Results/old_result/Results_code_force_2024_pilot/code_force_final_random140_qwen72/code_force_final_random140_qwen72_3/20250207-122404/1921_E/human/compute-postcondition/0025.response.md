Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `r[1] - y2`.** 

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `m - y2`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
