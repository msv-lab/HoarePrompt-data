### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates through each test case using a loop.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()` to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the input values for each test case and assigns them to variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.
   - It checks if `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`. If true, it prints "draw" and returns, which is correct because Bob cannot move up if he is already in the same or higher row than Alice.
   - If `x2` is greater than `x1`, it proceeds to check the parity of `(x2 - x1)`:
     - If `(x2 - x1)` is odd, it checks if `y1` equals `y2`. If true, Alice wins because she can move directly to Bob's position. If not, it adjusts `y1` and `x1` to simulate a move and checks again.
     - If `(x2 - x1)` is even, it performs similar checks but for Bob. If `y1` equals `y2`, Bob wins. Otherwise, it adjusts `y1` and `x1` and checks for winning conditions.

3. **Winning Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles the conditions where Alice or Bob can win by moving to the same position as the other player.
   - It also checks for draw conditions where neither player can force a win due to the board boundaries or the positions of the chips.

4. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The program ensures that the new positions of the chips do not go beyond the board boundaries by checking `1 <= x1 <= n` and `1 <= y1 <= m`.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic assumes optimal play by both players, which is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the conditions specified in the problem description and follows the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
