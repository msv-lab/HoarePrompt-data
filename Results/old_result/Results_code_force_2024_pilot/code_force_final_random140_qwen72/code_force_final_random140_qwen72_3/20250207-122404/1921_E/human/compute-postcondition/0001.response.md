The values from the list `r` are assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The specific values of these variables depend on the values in the list `r`. The function `func_1` remains undefined.

Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, and `func_1` is not properly defined.**
