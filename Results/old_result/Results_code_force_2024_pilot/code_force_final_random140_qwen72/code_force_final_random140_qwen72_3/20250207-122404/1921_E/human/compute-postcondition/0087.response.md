The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user's input, `answers` now includes the string 'Draw'.**
