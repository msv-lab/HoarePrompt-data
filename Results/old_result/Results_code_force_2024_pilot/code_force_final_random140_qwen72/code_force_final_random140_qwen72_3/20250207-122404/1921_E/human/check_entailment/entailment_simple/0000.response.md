### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but it is not properly defined to handle the input parameters. The function should take the board dimensions and initial positions as arguments.
   - The function reads input inside itself, which is not ideal for reusability and testing. However, for the purpose of this problem, it is acceptable.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The first condition checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because if Bob's chip is already in or above Alice's chip, no moves can be made to win, resulting in a draw.

3. **Odd Difference Case:**
   - If the difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd, the code checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, Alice wins immediately. This is correct because Alice can move directly to Bob's position.
   - If `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the code adjusts `y1` and `x1` to simulate a move. It then checks if `y1 == y2` again. If true, Alice wins. This is also correct.
   - If `y1` is still not equal to `y2`, the code calculates `a`, `b`, and `t` to simulate further moves and checks for a draw condition. This logic is complex but seems to correctly handle the odd difference case.

4. **Even Difference Case:**
   - If the difference `(x2 - x1)` is even, the code checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, Bob wins immediately. This is correct because Bob can move directly to Alice's position.
   - If `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the code adjusts `y1` and `x1` to simulate a move. It then checks for a draw condition. This logic is also complex but seems to correctly handle the even difference case.

5. **Return Statements:**
   - The function uses `return` statements after printing the result, which is correct to terminate the function after determining the outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement. The logic for determining the winner or a draw is sound and follows the rules of the game.

### Correctness:
**True**
