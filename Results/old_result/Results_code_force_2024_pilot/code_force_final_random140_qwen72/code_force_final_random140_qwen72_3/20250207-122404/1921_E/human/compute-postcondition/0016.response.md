Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Furthermore, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x1` is incremented by 1, so `x1` becomes `r[2] + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding the relationships between `x2` and `x1`, and `y1` and `y2` still hold true.
