Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer in the list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the list `x`, and `x` is a list of integers read from input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `profit` remains equal to `n * a`. If `a` is less than `b`, `profit` is updated to \( n \times a + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \), where `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.***
