The value of `k` is updated to the minimum of `n - 1` and the original value of `k`. Since `k` was initially defined as `b - a`, the new value of `k` will be the smaller of `n - 1` and `b - a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`, `profit` is equal to `n * a`, `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.**
