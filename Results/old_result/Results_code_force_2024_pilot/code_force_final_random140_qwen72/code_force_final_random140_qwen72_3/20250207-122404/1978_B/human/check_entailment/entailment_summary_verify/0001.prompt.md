You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        n = x[0]
        a = x[1]
        b = x[2]
        profit = n * a
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates a profit value based on these inputs: if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit is `n * a`; otherwise, the profit is adjusted using a formula that considers the difference between `a` and `b`. The calculated profit for each test case is printed. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and `t` is 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Initial Profit Calculation**: The initial profit is calculated as `n * a`, which is the profit if all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Condition Check**: The function checks if `a >= b`. If true, it means the usual price is greater than or equal to the modified price, so it's better to sell all buns at the usual price. In this case, the initial profit is printed.

4. **Optimal k Calculation**: If `a < b`, the function calculates the optimal value of `k` (the number of buns to be sold at the modified price). The optimal `k` is determined by the difference `b - a` and is limited by `n - 1` to ensure it does not exceed the number of buns available.

5. **Profit Adjustment**: The profit is adjusted by adding the additional profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{profit} = \text{profit} + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}
   \]
   This formula accounts for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the total discount applied to the first `k` buns.

6. **Output**: The final profit is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining the optimal `k` and adjusting the profit is correct.
- The formula used to adjust the profit is mathematically sound and correctly handles the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
- The function correctly handles edge cases where `a >= b` and when `k` is limited by `n - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.
