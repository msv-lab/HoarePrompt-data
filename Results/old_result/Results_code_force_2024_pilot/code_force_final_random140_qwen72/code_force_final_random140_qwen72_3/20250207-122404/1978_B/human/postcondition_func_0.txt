The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates a profit value based on these inputs: if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit is `n * a`; otherwise, the profit is adjusted using a formula that considers the difference between `a` and `b`. The calculated profit for each test case is printed. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and `t` is 0.
