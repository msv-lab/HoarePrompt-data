Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers (1 â‰¤ `n`, `a`, `b` â‰¤ 10^9); `x` is a list of integers read from input, where each integer is separated by a space. `n` is now equal to the first integer in the list `x`.**
