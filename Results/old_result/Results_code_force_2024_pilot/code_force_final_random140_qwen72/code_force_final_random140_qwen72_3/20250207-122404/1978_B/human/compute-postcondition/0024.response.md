Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`, `profit` is now equal to `n * a`, `k` is now equal to `min(n - 1, b - a)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to the minimum of `n - 1` and the original value of `k` (which was `b - a`).
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `profit`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
