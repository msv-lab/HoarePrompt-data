The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it seems to handle `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 10^4]. For each of these test cases, it also processes three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, each within the range [1, 10^9].

Given the context, the function's primary task appears to be processing these test cases and returning some result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
