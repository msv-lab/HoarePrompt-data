The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `profit` is equal to `n * a`. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`, and `profit` is equal to `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.**
