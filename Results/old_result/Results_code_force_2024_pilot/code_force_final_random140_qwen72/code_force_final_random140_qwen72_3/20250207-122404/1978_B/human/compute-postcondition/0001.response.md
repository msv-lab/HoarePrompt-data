For the given task, the state right before the while loop is:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9).

The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy.

Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, it is already guaranteed to be a positive integer, which means it is non-zero and thus truthy. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ `n`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9)**
