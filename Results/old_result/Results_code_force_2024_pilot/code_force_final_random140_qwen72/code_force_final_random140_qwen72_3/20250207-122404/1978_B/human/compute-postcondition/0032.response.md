The code snippet `a = x[1]` updates the value of `a` to be the second element in the list `x`. Given the initial state, `x` is a list of integers, and `a` was initially set to the second integer in `x`. Since the code reassigns `a` to the same value (the second element of `x`), there is no actual change in the value of `a`.

Therefore, the Output State remains:
**`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`.**
