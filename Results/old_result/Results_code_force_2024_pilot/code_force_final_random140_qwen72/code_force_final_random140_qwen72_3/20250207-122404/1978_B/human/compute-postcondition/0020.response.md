Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`, `profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = x[2]` assigns the value of the third element in the list `x` to the variable `b`. Since the initial state already specifies that `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`, the assignment does not change the value of `b`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
