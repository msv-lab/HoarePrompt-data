To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the formula for `profit` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `x`.
   - `a` is the second integer in the list `x`.
   - `b` is the third integer in the list `x`.
   - `x` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `profit` is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{profit} = n \times a + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - `a` is less than `b`.
   - `k` is equal to the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.

2. **Calculating `k`:**
   - `k` is determined by the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.
   - This means `k` will be the smaller of these two values.

3. **Calculating `profit`:**
   - Substitute `k` into the formula:
     \[
     \text{profit} = n \times a + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}
     \]

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Let's assume specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b` to illustrate the calculation:
     - Suppose `x = [5, 2, 4]` (so `n = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 4`).
     - Calculate `k`:
       \[
       k = \min(5 - 1, 4 - 2) = \min(4, 2) = 2
       \]
     - Substitute `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` into the profit formula:
       \[
       \text{profit} = 5 \times 2 + (4 - 2) \times (2 + 1) - \frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2}
       \]
       \[
       \text{profit} = 10 + 2 \times 3 - \frac{2 \times 3}{2}
       \]
       \[
       \text{profit} = 10 + 6 - 3
       \]
       \[
       \text{profit} = 13
       \]

5. **General Case:**
   - For any valid values of `n`, `a`, and `b` where `a < b`, the formula will compute the `profit` based on the given conditions.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(int(profit))` statement will print the integer value of `profit`.

Output: **int(profit) (where profit is calculated as \( n \times a + (b - a) \times (k + 1) - \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \) with \( k = \min(n - 1, b - a) \))**
