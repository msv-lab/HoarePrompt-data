Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to `x`.
- The initial state specifies that `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, which is now updated to the actual list of integers provided.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are derived from the new list `x` as the first, second, and third elements, respectively.
- The initial state conditions for `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The variables `profit` and `k` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so they are not part of the output state.
