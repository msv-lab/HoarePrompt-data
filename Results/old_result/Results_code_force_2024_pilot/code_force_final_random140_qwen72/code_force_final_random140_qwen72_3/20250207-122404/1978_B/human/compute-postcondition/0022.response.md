Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 and must be non-zero.
   - `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
   - `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`.
   - `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`.
   - `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`.
   - `profit` is now equal to `n * a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(profit)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `profit` is calculated as the product of `n` and `a`.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `x`.
   - `a` is the second integer in the list `x`.
   - Therefore, `profit = n * a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(profit)` statement will print the value of `profit`, which is the product of the first and second integers in the list `x`.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first integer in the list x and a is the second integer in the list x)**
