Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero.
- `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`.
- `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`.
- `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`.
- `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.
- `profit` is calculated as `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(profit))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Read Input:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, and it must be non-zero.
   - `x` is a list of integers read from the input.

2. **Extract Values from List:**
   - `n = x[0]` (the first integer in the list `x`).
   - `a = x[1]` (the second integer in the list `x`).
   - `b = x[2]` (the third integer in the list `x`).

3. **Calculate `k`:**
   - `k = min(n - 1, b - a)`

4. **Calculate `profit`:**
   - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`

5. **Print the Result:**
   - The `print` statement will convert `profit` to an integer and print it.

### Explanation of Variables:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integers from the input list `x`.
- `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`, ensuring that `k` is the smaller of these two values.
- `profit` is calculated using the formula provided, which involves multiplication, addition, and subtraction operations.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of `profit` based on the given formula and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input list `x`.

Output: **int(profit) (where profit is calculated as n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2, with k being the minimum of n - 1 and b - a)**
