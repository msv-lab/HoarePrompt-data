To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
team = goalIn(pos)
```

This line of code calls a function `goalIn` with the argument `pos`. The function `goalIn` is expected to return a value that is then assigned to the variable `team`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: `goalIn(pos)` is called.
2. **Return Value**: The return value of `goalIn(pos)` is assigned to `team`.

Since the function `goalIn` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact value it returns. However, we can infer that `team` will hold whatever value `goalIn(pos)` returns.

### Impact on Variables:
- **`team`**: This variable is newly introduced and will hold the return value of `goalIn(pos)`.
- **Other Variables**: All other variables (`command`, `n`, `i`, `line`, `ind`, `grid`, `elements`, `goal`, `tmp`, `t`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`, `allPlayers[obj]`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, `obj` is `command[0]`, `com` is `command[1]`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `team` is the return value of `goalIn(pos)`**.
