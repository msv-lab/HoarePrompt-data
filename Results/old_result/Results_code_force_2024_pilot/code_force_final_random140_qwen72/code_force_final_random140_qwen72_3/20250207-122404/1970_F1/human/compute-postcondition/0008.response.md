The code `grid.append(line)` adds the list `line` to the end of the list `grid`. Since `line` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `grid` will now contain one more element, which is the `line` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `grid` contains `line` as its last element.**
