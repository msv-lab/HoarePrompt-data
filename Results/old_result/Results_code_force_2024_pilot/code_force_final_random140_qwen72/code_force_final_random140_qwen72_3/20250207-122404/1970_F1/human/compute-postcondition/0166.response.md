Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, `obj` is `command[0]`, `com` is `command[1]`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and the next position `nxt` contains a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is the position of '.B', then `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is the element at position `nxt` in the `grid`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the return value of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `obj` is a player, the `elements` dictionary now contains the key `obj` with the value `nxt`.***
