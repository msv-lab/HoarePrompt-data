Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column). If `obj` is a player, the `elements` dictionary now contains the key `obj` with the value `nxt`. The `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column). `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, `obj` is `command[0]`, `com` is `command[1]`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.***
