Output State: **`elements[obj]` is now `nxt`, all other variables retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code updates the `elements` dictionary by setting the key `obj` to the value `nxt`. This means that the position of the object `obj` in the grid is now represented by the tuple `nxt`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
