Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, `grid` contains `line` as its last element, `elements` includes the key `line[2]` with the value `(0, 2)`. If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` is updated to include the key `line[1]` with the value `(0, 1)`. If the first element of `line` is not '..', then `elements` also includes the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `(0, 0)`. If the first element of `line` is a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`. If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)`. If the first element of `line` is '..', no changes are made to any variables. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `False`. If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal[1]` also contains the tuple `(0, 1)`. If `line[2]` is a player, `allPlayers` includes the key `line[2]` with the value `False`. If `line[2][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B'; otherwise, `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(0, 2)`.***
