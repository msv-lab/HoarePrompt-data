The code reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `line`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line.**
