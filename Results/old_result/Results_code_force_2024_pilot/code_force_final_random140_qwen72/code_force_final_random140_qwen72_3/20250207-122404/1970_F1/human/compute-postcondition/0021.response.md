Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` contains `line` as its last element. If the first element of `line` is not '..', then `elements` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being a tuple (0, 0). If the first element of `line` is a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`. If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is a list containing the tuple (0, 0). If the first element of `line` is '..', no changes are made to any variables.***
