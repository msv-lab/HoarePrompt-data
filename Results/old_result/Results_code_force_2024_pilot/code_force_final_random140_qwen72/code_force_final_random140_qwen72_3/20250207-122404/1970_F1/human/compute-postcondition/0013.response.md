Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` contains `line` as its last element, and the first element of `line` is not '..'. `elements` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being a tuple (0, 0). Additionally, the first element of `line` is a player (as determined by the function `isPlayer`).**
