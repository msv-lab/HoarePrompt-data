The provided code snippet unpacks the list `command` into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. Given that `command` is a list of strings with a length of 3, each of these variables will take the corresponding value from the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the grid, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, and the length of `command` is 3, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`.**
