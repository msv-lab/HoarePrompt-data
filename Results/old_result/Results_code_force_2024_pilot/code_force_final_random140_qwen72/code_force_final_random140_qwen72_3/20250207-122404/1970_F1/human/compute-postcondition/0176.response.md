To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`time`**: This is explicitly given as 2.
2. **`team`**: This is determined by the first character of `obj`. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.
3. **`GoalName`**: This is a dictionary that maps team numbers (0 or 1) to names. Since `team` can be either 0 or 1, `GoalName[team]` will be the name associated with the team.

Given the initial state:
- `obj` is the first string in `command`.
- `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.

Let's assume the following for the sake of clarity:
- `command = ['B123', 'some_command', 'some_element']`

From this:
- `obj = 'B123'`
- The first character of `obj` is 'B'
- Therefore, `team = 1`

Now, we need to know the value of `GoalName[1]`. Since `GoalName` is not explicitly provided, we can assume it is a dictionary that maps team numbers to names. For example:
- `GoalName = {0: 'Team A', 1: 'Team B'}`

Given this assumption:
- `GoalName[1] = 'Team B'`

Now, substituting the values into the `print` statement:
```python
print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

This will print:
- `time` which is 2
- `GoalName[team]` which is 'Team B'

So, the final output will be:
Output: **2 Team B CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
