To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
- `i` is 0.
- `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements.
- `ind` is 2.
- `grid` contains `line` as its last element.
- `elements` includes the key `line[2]` with the value `(0, 2)`.
- If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` is updated to include the key `line[1]` with the value `(0, 1)`.
- If the first element of `line` is not '..', then `elements` also includes the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `(0, 0)`.
- If the first element of `line` is a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`.
- If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)`.
- If the first element of `line` is '..', no changes are made to any variables.
- If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `False`.
- If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.
- If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal[1]` also contains the tuple `(0, 1)`.
- `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
goal[tmp].append((i, ind))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `tmp`**:
   - `tmp` is determined based on the first character of `line[2]`.
   - If the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` is 1.

2. **Update `goal[tmp]`**:
   - The tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.
   - Given `i` is 0 and `ind` is 2, the tuple `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
- `i` is 0.
- `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements.
- `ind` is 2.
- `grid` contains `line` as its last element.
- `elements` includes the key `line[2]` with the value `(0, 2)`.
- If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` is updated to include the key `line[1]` with the value `(0, 1)`.
- If the first element of `line` is not '..', then `elements` also includes the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `(0, 0)`.
- If the first element of `line` is a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`.
- If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)`.
- If the first element of `line` is '..', no changes are made to any variables.
- If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `False`.
- If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.
- If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal[1]` also contains the tuple `(0, 1)`.
- `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.
- `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(0, 2)`.
