Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the grid, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `elements['.B']` is `nxt`, then `player` is set to `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `player` is the player element found at the position `nxt` in the grid. If `obj` is not '.B' or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, and if `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not `nxt`, then: if `com` is 'T' and `pos` is a goal position, `team` is the index returned by `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is increased by 1; if `com` is 'T' but `pos` is not a goal position, the state remains unchanged; if `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`; if `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is not a player, the state remains unchanged.***
