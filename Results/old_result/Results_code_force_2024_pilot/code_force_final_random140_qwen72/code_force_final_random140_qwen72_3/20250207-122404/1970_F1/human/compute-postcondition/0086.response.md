Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must contain at least one element, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index). If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..': the entry for `line[ind]` in `elements` is updated to `(2, 0)`, `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is a player element, the value for `line[ind]` in `allPlayers` is explicitly set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player element and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', the tuple `(2, 0)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. The `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or 1 if it is not. If `line[ind]` is equal to '..': no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`.***
