To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
- `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1.
- `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input.
- `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column).
- `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the grid, with values set to `False`.
- `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column).
- `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `time` is 0.
- `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
- `obj` is the first element of `command`.
- `com` is the second element of `command`.
- `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
- `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
- `player` is now `obj` if `obj` is a player element, otherwise `player` is the player element found at the position `nxt` in the grid.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`time`**: This is explicitly given as 0.
2. **`player`**: This is determined based on the value of `obj` and the position `nxt`:
   - If `obj` is a player element, `player` is set to `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is the player element found at the position `nxt` in the grid.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the current time (which is 0) and the name of the player who is eliminated.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:
Output: **0 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is the name of the player element either directly specified by `obj` or found at the position `nxt` in the grid)**.
