To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
   - `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1.
   - `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input.
   - `elements` is a dictionary containing keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `goal` is a list containing tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `obj` is `command[0]`.
   - `com` is `command[1]`.
   - `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
   - `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the return value of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `team` is the return value of the function `goalIn(pos)`. This function likely checks if the position `pos` is a goal position and returns a team identifier.
   - `GoalName` is a dictionary or list that maps team identifiers to their names.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will depend on the value of `team` and the corresponding entry in `GoalName`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since `time` is 1, the first part of the output will be `1`.
   - The second part of the output will be the name of the team as determined by `GoalName[team]`.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **1 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [GoalName[team]] is the name of the team as determined by the `goalIn(pos)` function and the `GoalName` mapping)**
