Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The program includes references to variables and functions that are not defined within the provided code, such as `mov` and `GoalName`. These should be defined or initialized before they are used.
- The handling of the Quaffle and scoring logic seems to be incomplete or incorrect. For example, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.
- The elimination logic (`if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt):`) is not clear and does not seem to match the problem description, which does not mention any rules about eliminating players.
- The program includes logic for catching the Golden Snitch (`el == '.S'`), which is not part of the problem description and should be removed.
- The movement of the Quaffle back to the center after a goal is not implemented in the provided code.
- The function `goalIn` could be more clearly written to avoid potential confusion with the `in` operator and list membership checks.

These issues suggest that the program does not fully or correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description.
