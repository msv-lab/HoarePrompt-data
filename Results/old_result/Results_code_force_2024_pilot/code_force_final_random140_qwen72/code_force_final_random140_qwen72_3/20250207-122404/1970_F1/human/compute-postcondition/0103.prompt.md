Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must contain at least one element, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index). If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..': the entry for `line[ind]` in `elements` is updated to `(2, 0)`, `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is a player element, the value for `line[ind]` in `allPlayers` is explicitly set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player element and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', the tuple `(2, 0)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. The `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or 1 if it is not. If `line[ind]` is equal to '..': no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must contain at least two elements, `ind` is 1, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..': the entry for `line[1]` in `elements` is updated to `(2, 1)`. If `line[0]` is not equal to '..': the entry for `line[0]` in `elements` is updated to `(2, 0)`, `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`. The value for `line[1]` in `allPlayers` is explicitly set to `False`. If `line[0]` is a player element, the value for `line[0]` in `allPlayers` is explicitly set to `False`. If `line[0]` is not a player element and the second character of `line[0]` is 'G', the tuple `(2, 0)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. The `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[0]` is 'B' or 1 if it is not. Additionally, if `line[0]` is not a player element and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', the tuple `(2, 1)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. If `line[1]` is equal to '..': no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must contain at least three elements, `ind` is 2, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index). If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..': the entry for `line[ind]` in `elements` is updated to `(2, 2)`. If `line[1]` is not equal to '..': the entry for `line[1]` in `elements` is updated to `(2, 1)`. If `line[0]` is not equal to '..': the entry for `line[0]` in `elements` is updated to `(2, 0)`. `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`. The value for `line[1]` in `allPlayers` is explicitly set to `False`. If `line[0]` is a player element, the value for `line[0]` in `allPlayers` is explicitly set to `False`. If `line[0]` is not a player element and the second character of `line[0]` is 'G', the tuple `(2, 0)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. The `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[0]` is 'B' or 1 if it is not. Additionally, if `line[0]` is not a player element and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', the tuple `(2, 1)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. If `line[1]` is equal to '..': no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`. If `line[ind]` is a player element, the value for `line[ind]` in `allPlayers` is explicitly set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player element and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', the tuple `(2, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. If `line[ind]` is equal to '..': no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
