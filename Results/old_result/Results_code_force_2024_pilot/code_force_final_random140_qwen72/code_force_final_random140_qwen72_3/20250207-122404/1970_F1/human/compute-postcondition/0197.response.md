To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- `points` is a list with at least two elements.
- The elements at indices 0 and 1 of the `points` list are the final scores after the loop has finished executing.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses string formatting to print the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.
- `%d` is a placeholder for an integer value.
- `points[0]` and `points[1]` are the values at the first and second positions in the `points` list, respectively.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string "FINAL SCORE: " followed by the integer values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final scores after the loop has completed all iterations)**
