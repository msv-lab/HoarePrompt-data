To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
- `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1.
- `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input.
- `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column).
- `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column).
- `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `time` is 1.
- `obj` is `command[0]`.
- `com` is `command[1]`.
- `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
- `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
- `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is the element at position `nxt` in the `grid`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`time`**: This is explicitly given as 1.
2. **`player`**: 
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is the element at position `nxt` in the `grid`.

### Determining `player`:
- `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
- `com` is the second element of the `command` list.
- `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
- `nxt` is the next position based on the movement command `com`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- If `obj` is a player (as determined by `isPlayer(obj)` returning `True`), then `player` will be `obj`.
- If `obj` is not a player, then `player` will be the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement will output the time (which is 1) and the `player` (which could be either `obj` or the element at position `nxt`).

Output: **1 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, or the element at position `nxt` in the `grid` otherwise)**
