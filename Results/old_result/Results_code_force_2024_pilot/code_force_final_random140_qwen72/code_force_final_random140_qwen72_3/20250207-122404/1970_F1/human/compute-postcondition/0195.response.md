Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers` dictionary now includes the key `obj` with the value `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and all other variables retain their previous values. If `obj` is not '.B', all variables retain their previous values.***
