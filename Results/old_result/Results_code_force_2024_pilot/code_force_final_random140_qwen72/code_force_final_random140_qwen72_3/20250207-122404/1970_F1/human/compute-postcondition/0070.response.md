Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each index `ind` in the `line` list, starting from 0 and ending at the last index of `line`.
- After the loop completes, `ind` will be 0 because the loop has processed all indices from 0 to `len(line) - 1`.
- The `elements` dictionary will contain keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index).
- The `allPlayers` dictionary will contain keys for each player element in `line`, with values set to `False`.
- The `goal` list will contain tuples for each non-player element in `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index).
- The `tmp` variable will be set based on the first character of the elements that have 'G' as their second character, with `tmp` being 0 if the first character is 'B' and 1 otherwise.
- The `grid` will contain the `line` as its last element, and the other variables (`n`, `i`, `line`) will remain unchanged from their initial state.
