Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range condition, which is `1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `l` is a list containing the element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `x // i` (if `i` is 1) and 1 (if `i` is 2).

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - If `i` was 2 in the previous iteration, the loop will terminate because `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` will be greater than 2 if `x` is sufficiently large, but since `i` is already 2, the loop will stop.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
   - The range condition remains the same: `1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - `x`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` becomes 2.
- The range condition remains the same.
- `x`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `x // i` (if `i` is 1) and 1 (if `i` is 2)**.
