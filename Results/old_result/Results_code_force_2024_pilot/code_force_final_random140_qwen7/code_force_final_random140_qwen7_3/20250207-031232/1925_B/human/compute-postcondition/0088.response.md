Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to the first input, `n` is an integer equal to the second input, `i` is `x`, `k` is `x // n`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of `x` divided by `n` using integer division (`//`). The values of `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
