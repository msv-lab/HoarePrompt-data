Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `int(x)`, `n` is an integer obtained from input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. The values of `x`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the new value of `ans`.
