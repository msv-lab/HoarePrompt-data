Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is the placeholder `_`, but since it is a placeholder and not used in the loop body, we don't need to concern ourselves with its value. Instead, we focus on the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), the input will always be a valid positive integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the States**: Given that the loop will always execute for any valid input within the specified range, the only state that needs adjustment is the one that ensures the loop can start executing. This means ensuring that the input is a valid positive integer.

4. **Formulate the State**: Since the loop will execute for any valid input, we need to ensure that the input is within the specified range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input (which is `t`) is a valid positive integer within the given constraints.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
