Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is `x + 1` and `x` is a non-negative integer, `x // i` will be 0 because `x` is less than `i`. Therefore, the list `l` now contains the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
