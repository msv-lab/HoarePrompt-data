Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is either 2 or 3.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `l` is a list containing `[max(ans, x // i), i]`.
- `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. **Variable `i`**: The loop increments `i` starting from `1` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
3. **Previous Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `2` or `3`.

### Determining the Next Value of `i`:
- If `i` was `2` in the previous iteration, the next possible value of `i` would be `3`.
- If `i` was `3` in the previous iteration, the next possible value of `i` would be `4` (since the loop goes up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`).

### Adjusting the State:
- Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each time, if `i` was `2`, it will become `3` in the next iteration.
- If `i` was `3`, it will become `4` in the next iteration.

### Other Variables:
- `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `l` and `ans` are updated based on the current value of `i` but are not directly affected by the loop increment itself.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `3` if it was `2` in the previous iteration, or `4` if it was `3`.
- `x` remains the same.
- `l` and `ans` are updated but their values are not specified in the problem statement, so they remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` is a list containing `[max(ans, x // i), i]`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`**.

However, since `i` could also be `4` if it was `3` in the previous iteration, we should include both possibilities:

State: **`i` is 3 or 4, `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` is a list containing `[max(ans, x // i), i]`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`**.
