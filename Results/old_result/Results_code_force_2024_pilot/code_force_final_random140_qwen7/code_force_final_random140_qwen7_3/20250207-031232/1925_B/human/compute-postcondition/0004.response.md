Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `x ** 0.5`, and `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 1 each time. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 1.
   - **Expression `x ** 0.5`**: This expression calculates the square root of `x`. The loop will iterate up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - **Expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`**: This expression determines the upper limit of the loop. For the loop to execute, this value must be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` must start at 1, we need to ensure `i` is 1.
   - We don't directly control `x ** 0.5` or `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, but we need to ensure that `x` is a valid integer such that `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` is a positive integer. This means `x` must be a non-negative integer.

4. **Consider the given initial states**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable `t` is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer (though not used in the loop).
   - `k` is the floor division result of `x` by `n` (though not used in the loop).
   - `ans` is 1 (though not used in the loop).

Given these considerations, the only states that need to be adjusted are related to `i` and the condition for the loop to execute, which is determined by `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be a non-negative integer such that `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` is a positive integer**
