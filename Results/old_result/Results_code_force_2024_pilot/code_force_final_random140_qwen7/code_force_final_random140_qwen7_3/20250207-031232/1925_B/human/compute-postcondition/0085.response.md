Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `n` is an integer obtained from input.
- `i` is calculated as `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- `l` is a list containing the maximum values found for each divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is `x // n`.
- `ans` is the maximum value among all the elements in `l`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum value found in the list `l`.

To break it down further:
- `i` is one more than the integer part of the square root of `x`.
- `k` is `x // n`, which means `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.
- `l` is constructed by iterating over all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and for each divisor, finding the maximum value of `x` divided by that divisor.
- `ans` is the highest value found in the list `l`.

Given this information, the output will be the maximum value found in the list `l`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value among all the elements in the list l)**
