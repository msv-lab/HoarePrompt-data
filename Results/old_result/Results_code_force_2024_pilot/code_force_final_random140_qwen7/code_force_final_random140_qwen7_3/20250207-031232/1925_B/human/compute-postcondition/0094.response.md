Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i` equals 0, `l` is `[1, i]`, the value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` is `[1]`. Since `i` is equal to `x`, after appending `i` to `l`, `l` becomes `[1, x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
