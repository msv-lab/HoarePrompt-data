Output State: `i` is equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` is a list containing `[ans, int(x ** 0.5) + 1]`, and `ans` is equal to the maximum value found during the iterations, which is the maximum of `ans` and `x // j` for all divisors `j` of `x` such that `1 ≤ j ≤ int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the last value it took, which is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. The variable `x` remains unchanged. The list `l` contains the final value of `ans` and the last value of `i`. The variable `ans` holds the maximum value among all the divisors of `x` considered during the loop, specifically the maximum of `ans` and `x // j` for each divisor `j` of `x` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
