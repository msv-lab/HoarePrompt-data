Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the floor division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
