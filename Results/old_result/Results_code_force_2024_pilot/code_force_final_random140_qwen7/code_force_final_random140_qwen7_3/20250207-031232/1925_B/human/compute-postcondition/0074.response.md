Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `ans` is the maximum value between `x // 2` and 1 if `x % 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains the same, and `l` now contains `[3]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `l`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the appended value in the list `l`.
