Output State: **`i` is 3 or 4; `x` is a non-negative integer; `l` is `[ans, 3]` or `[ans, 4]`; `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // 3` or `ans` and `x // 4`.**

Explanation: The list `l` appends the value of `i` (which is either 3 or 4) to itself. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as no direct assignment to `ans` is made within the given code snippet. The value of `ans` is updated only when `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i` during the initialization or any prior operations, but this specific operation does not affect the current state of `ans` unless explicitly stated otherwise.
