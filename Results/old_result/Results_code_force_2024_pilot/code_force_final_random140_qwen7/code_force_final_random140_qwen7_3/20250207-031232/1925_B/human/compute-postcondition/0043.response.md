Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `int(x)`, `n` is an integer obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers. The first input is assigned to `x`, and the second input is assigned to `n`. The value of `x` remains a non-negative integer as per the initial state, and `i` is updated to `int(x)`. The value of `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
