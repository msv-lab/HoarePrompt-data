Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `x` is a non-negative integer; `l` is a list containing `[max(ans, x // i), i]`; `ans` is equal to the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(l)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum value between the current value of `ans` and the first element of the list `l`, which is `[max(ans, x // i), i]`. Since `l` is defined such that its first element is already `max(ans, x // i)`, the value of `ans` will be updated to this maximum value. The values of `i`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
