Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `l` is a list containing at least three elements: `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`.
   - If `i` is 2, then `l` contains two additional elements, `ans` and `2`.
   - The value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in list `l`.

4. **Determine the next possible value of `i`**: Since `i` is either 1 or 2, the next value of `i` would be 2 if it was 1, and 3 if it was 2.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was 1, the next value of `i` is 2. We need to check if `2 < int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - If `i` was 2, the next value of `i` is 3. We need to check if `3 < int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was 1, then `i` becomes 2.
   - If `i` was 2, then `i` becomes 3.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `l` should still contain at least three elements: `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`.
   - If `i` was 2, then `l` should still contain the additional elements `ans` and `2`.
   - The value of `x // i` should still be less than or equal to `k`.
   - `ans` should still be the maximum value among the elements in list `l`.

Given these considerations, let's formulate the new state:

- If `i` was 1, then `i` becomes 2.
- If `i` was 2, then `i` becomes 3.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we consider both possibilities. However, we can generalize the state based on the conditions given.

**State:**
- `i` is either 2 or 3 (depending on the previous value).
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `l` is a list containing at least three elements: `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`.
- If `i` is 3, then `l` contains two additional elements, `ans` and `2`.
- The value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in list `l`.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` is a list containing at least three elements: `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`. If `i` is 3, then `l` contains two additional elements, `ans` and `2`. The value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in list `l`.**
