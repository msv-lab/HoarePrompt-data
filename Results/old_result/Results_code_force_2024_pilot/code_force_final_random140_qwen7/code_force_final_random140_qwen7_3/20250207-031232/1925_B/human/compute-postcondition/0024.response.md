Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or 3; `x` is a non-negative integer; `l` is a list containing `[max(ans, x // i), i]`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is updated to contain the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`, along with the value of `i`. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` remains unchanged.
