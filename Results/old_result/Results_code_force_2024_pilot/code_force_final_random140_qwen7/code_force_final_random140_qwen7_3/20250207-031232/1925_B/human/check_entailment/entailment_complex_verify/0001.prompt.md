You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = x // n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be a non-negative integer, `n` will be an integer, `i` will be `int(x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3), followed by pairs of positive integers \( x \) and \( n \) (1 ≤ \( x \) ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ \( x \)). For each pair \( x \) and \( n \), it calculates and prints the maximum value among 1, any divisor \( i \) of \( x \) where \( i \leq x/n \), and any divisor \( x/i \) of \( x \) where \( x/i \leq x/n \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the minimum possible difficulty per sub-problem if the difficulties were evenly distributed.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the default GCD value if no better solution is found.

3. **Finding Possible Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` to find divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are both less than or equal to `k`.
   - If so, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the divisor or the quotient.

4. **Output**:
   - After finding the maximum balance, it prints `ans`.

### Reasoning:

1. **Divisor Search**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2)` ensures that all divisors of `x` are considered.
   - This approach is efficient because the maximum possible divisor is `sqrt(x)`, and checking up to this point covers all divisors.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program correctly identifies potential balances by considering both `i` and `x // i` as possible difficulties.
   - By ensuring both values are less than or equal to `k`, it guarantees that the sum of the difficulties equals `x`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when `x` is prime or when `n` is large compared to `x`.
   - For example, if `x` is prime and `n` is 1, the program correctly outputs `x` as the balance.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. It efficiently finds the maximum balance by considering all possible divisors and updating the balance accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
