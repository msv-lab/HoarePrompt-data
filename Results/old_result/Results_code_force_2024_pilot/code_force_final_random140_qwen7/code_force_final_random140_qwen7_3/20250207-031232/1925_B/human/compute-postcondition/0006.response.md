Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is a non-negative integer such that `int(x) % 1 == 0`, `l` is a list containing one element which is `ans`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `l` with a single element `ans`. Since no specific value was assigned to `ans`, it remains as `ans`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
