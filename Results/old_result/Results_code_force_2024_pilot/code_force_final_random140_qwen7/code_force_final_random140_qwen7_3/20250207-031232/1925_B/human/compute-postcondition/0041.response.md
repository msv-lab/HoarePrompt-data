Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- `x` will remain the same non-negative integer.
- `l` will be `[max(ans, x // i), i]`.
- `ans` will be the maximum value found during the loop execution, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
