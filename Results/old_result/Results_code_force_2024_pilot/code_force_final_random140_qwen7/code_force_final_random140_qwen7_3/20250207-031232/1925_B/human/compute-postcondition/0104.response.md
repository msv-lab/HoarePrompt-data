Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range condition which is `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is `x`.
   - `k` is `x // n`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. This means `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to `x`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1` (since it starts from `1` and increments by `1` each time).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `x + 1`.
   - The range condition `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` must still hold true for the next iteration to execute.

5. **Check the range condition**: For the loop to continue, `x + 1` must be within the range `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. This means `x + 1 <= int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `x + 1`.
   - The range condition remains valid as long as `x + 1 <= int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 1`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
