Output State: **`i` is 3 or 4, `x` is a non-negative integer, `l` is `[ans]`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`**.

Explanation: The line `l = [ans]` updates the list `l` to contain only the element `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated state of `l` is `[ans]`, which means the list now contains only the value of `ans`.
