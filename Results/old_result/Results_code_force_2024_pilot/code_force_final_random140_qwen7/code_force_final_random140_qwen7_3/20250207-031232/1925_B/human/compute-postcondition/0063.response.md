Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and 2.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains the element `ans` (which is 1). After appending, `l` will contain both `ans` and the new element 2. The values of `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
