Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to the first input, `n` is an integer equal to the second input, `i` is `int(x)` which is the same as `x`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input, splits them, and assigns them to `x` and `n`. Since `x` was already an integer (as per the initial state), `i` is reassigned to `int(x)`, which is the same as `x`. Therefore, `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `x`.
