Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    k = x // n
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            l = [ans]
            if i <= k:
                l.append(i)
            if x // i <= k:
                l.append(x // i)
            ans = max(l)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `x` will remain the same non-negative integer, `l` will be `[max(ans, x // i), i]`, and `ans` will be the maximum value found during the loop execution, which is the maximum value among all `x // i` where `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, `i` will be one more than the square root of `x`, and `l` will contain the maximum value found and the corresponding divisor `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `l` is a list containing the maximum values found for each divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum value among all the elements in `l`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` remains a non-negative integer, `n` is the integer obtained from input, `i` is one more than the integer part of the square root of `x`, `l` contains the maximum values of `x` divided by each of its divisors up to `k`, and `ans` holds the highest value found in `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + (int(x




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
