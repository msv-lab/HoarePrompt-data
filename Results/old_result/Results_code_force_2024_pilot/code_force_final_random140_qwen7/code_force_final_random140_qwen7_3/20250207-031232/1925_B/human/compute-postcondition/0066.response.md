Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and 2, and `l` now contains `ans`, 2, and `x // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` (which is `x // 2` since `i` is 2) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains `ans` and 2. After appending `x // 2`, `l` now contains `ans`, 2, and `x // 2`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
