Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `x` is a non-negative integer; `l` is a list containing `[ans, i]`, `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, the updated list `l` will contain `[ans, i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value between the original element in the list and the new appended value of `i`.
