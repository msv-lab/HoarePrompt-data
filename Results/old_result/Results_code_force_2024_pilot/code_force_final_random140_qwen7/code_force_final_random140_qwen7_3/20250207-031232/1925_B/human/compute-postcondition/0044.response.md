Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `int(x)`, `n` is an integer obtained from input, `k` is `x // n`**.

This means that `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. The values of `x`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, while `k` is now set to the result of `x // n`.
