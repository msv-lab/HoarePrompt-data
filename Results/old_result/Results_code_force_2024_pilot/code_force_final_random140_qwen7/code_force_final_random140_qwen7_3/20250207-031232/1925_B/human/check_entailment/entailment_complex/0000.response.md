Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
3. It calculates `k` as `x // n`, which is used as a reference point for the divisors.
4. The program then iterates over potential divisors `i` of `x` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. This is a good approach because the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` would be at most `int(x ** 0.5)`.
5. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are within the allowed limits (`i <= k` and `x // i <= k`) and updates `ans` with the maximum value found.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum balance `ans`.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program should work correctly for the problem statement. The key steps are:
- Finding the divisors of `x`.
- Ensuring the divisors are within the limit defined by `k`.
- Taking the maximum of these values.

Since the logic aligns with the problem requirements and the constraints are handled appropriately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
