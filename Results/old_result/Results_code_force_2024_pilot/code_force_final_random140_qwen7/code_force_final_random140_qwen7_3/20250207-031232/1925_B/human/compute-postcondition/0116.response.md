Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is `x + 1`.
   - `k` is `x // n`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `x % i == 0`, `i` is appended to the list `l` and `ans` remains the maximum value in the list `l`.

4. **Next iteration of the loop**:
   - The loop starts with `i = x + 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `x + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `x + 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i <= int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

6. **Check the loop continuation condition**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is still within the range of the loop, i.e., `i <= int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
   - Since `i` was `x + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` is `x + 2`.
   - Therefore, we need to check if `x + 2` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

7. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now `x + 2`.
   - The other variables (`x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `l`) remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are specified, they stay the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is `x + 2`, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and if `x % i == 0`, `i` is appended to the list `l` and `ans` remains the maximum value in the list `l`.**
