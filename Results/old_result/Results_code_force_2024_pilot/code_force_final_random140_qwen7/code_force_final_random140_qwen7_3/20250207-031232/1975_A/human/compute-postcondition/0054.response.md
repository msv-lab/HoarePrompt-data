Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` equals `n`.
- `new` is an empty list.
- `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition \((a[i - 1] < a[i])\) for all `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`.
- `new_all` is `None`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of other variables or the conditions specified for `check_all`.

Output: **YES**
