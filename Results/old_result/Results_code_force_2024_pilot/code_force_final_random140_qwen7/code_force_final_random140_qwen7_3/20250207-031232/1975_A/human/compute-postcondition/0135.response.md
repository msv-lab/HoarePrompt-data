Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`.
   - `new_all` is the result of evaluating the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The code snippet directly prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The value of `new` is not explicitly provided, but it is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`.
   - The value of `new_all` is not relevant to the print statement, as the print statement does not reference `new_all`.

Given the code snippet, the print statement will always execute and print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
