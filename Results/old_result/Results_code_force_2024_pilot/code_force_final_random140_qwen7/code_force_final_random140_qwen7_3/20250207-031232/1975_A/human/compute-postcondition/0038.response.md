Output State: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of variable `a`; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the corresponding first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `check_all` to the result of the `all` function applied to a list comprehension. This list comprehension checks if each element in `new` (which is a slice from index 3 onwards of `a`) is less than the corresponding first element of `a`. Since no specific values are given for `a`, the value of `check_all` depends on the comparison between the elements of `a` and `new`. The variables `i` and `new` retain their initial states, and `check_all` is set to the result of the comparison.
