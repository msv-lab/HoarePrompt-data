Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`, and `check_all` retains its last evaluated value (which could be True or False depending on the input list `a`).**
