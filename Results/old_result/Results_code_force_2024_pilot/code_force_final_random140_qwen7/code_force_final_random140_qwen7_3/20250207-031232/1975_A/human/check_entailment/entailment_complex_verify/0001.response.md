### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes the array to check if it can be made non-decreasing.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The code first checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. This condition checks if the array is strictly increasing, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the array to be non-decreasing. A strictly increasing array is indeed non-decreasing, but a non-decreasing array can have equal adjacent elements.

3. **Handling Non-Non-Decreasing Arrays:**
   - If the array is not already non-decreasing, the code iterates through possible split points (from index 1 to n-1).
   - For each split point, it creates a new array `new` from the part of the original array starting from the current index.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the new array.
     - `new_all` checks if the new array itself is non-decreasing.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such split point satisfies the conditions, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is correct.
   - However, the initial check `all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` is too strict. It should check if the array is non-decreasing, allowing for equal adjacent elements.
   - The nested loop and conditional checks for the split points and their validity are implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct. While the overall logic for determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is correct, the initial check should be relaxed to allow for equal adjacent elements. Therefore, the function will incorrectly identify some arrays as non-decreasing when they are actually non-decreasing with equal adjacent elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
