Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i` equal to `n`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as specified by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be `1` because the loop will increment `i` starting from `1` up to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is set to `n` initially, we need to adjust `i` to `1` to allow the loop to begin.
   - The value of `n` itself doesn't change within the loop, but it must be such that the loop can run from `1` to `n-1`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `new`, `new_all`, `a`, and `check_all` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values don't affect the loop's ability to execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`:

- `i` should be `1`.
- `n` must be such that the loop can run from `1` to `n-1`.

Thus, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.
