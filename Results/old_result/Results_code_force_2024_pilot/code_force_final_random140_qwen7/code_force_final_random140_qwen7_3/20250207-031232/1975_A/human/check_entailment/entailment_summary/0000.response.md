Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. For each test case, it first checks if the array is already strictly increasing (`check_all = all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`). If it is, it prints 'YES'.
3. If the array is not strictly increasing, it enters a loop to find a potential split point where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is non-decreasing.
4. Inside this loop, it checks if the first element of the array is greater than all elements in the rest of the array (`check_all = all([a[0] > new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`), and if the rest of the array is non-decreasing (`new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`).
5. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
6. If no such split point is found, it prints 'NO'.

Based on the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem description and the provided execution summary. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
