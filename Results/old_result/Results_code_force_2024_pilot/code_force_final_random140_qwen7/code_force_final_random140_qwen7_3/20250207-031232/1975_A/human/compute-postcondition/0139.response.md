Postcondition: `i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[3]`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In both cases (whether the condition `check_all and new_all` is true or false), the function exits the most internal loop or if statement.
