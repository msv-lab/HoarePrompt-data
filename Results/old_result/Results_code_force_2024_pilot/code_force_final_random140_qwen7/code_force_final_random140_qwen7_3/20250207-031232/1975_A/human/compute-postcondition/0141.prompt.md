Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `new` is either an empty list or a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all adjacent elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in increasing order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, and `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if not all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`. If all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element, `check_all` is True. Otherwise, `check_all` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`. If `a[2] > a[3]`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` is evaluated, and if it is true, `check_all` remains False; if it is false, `check_all` becomes True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
