Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether each element in `a` (except the first one) is greater than its preceding element.**

Explanation: The code checks if each element in the list `a` (starting from the second element) is greater than the previous element. This is done using a list comprehension within the `all()` function, which returns `True` only if all elements in the generated list are `True`. If any element is not greater than its preceding element, `check_all` will be `False`. Otherwise, it will be `True`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
