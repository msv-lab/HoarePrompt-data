Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[i - 1] < a[i])` for all `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, `new_all` is `None`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `new_all` is True, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `new_all` is the result of the all() function checking if each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2, and `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, regardless of whether the if condition is true or false, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `new_all` is the result of the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be at least 2, `check_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`, and in either case (if `check_all` and `new_all` are true, or if they are false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
