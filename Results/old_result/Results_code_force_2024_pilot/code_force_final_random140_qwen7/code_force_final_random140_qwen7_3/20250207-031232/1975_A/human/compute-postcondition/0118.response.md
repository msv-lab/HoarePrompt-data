Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
