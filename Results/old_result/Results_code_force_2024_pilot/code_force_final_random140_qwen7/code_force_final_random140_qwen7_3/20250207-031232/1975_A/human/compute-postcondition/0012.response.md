Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `check_all` to the result of a list comprehension that checks if each element in `new` is less than the first element of list `a`. Since no specific values for `a` are given, `check_all` will be a boolean value depending on the comparison. The values of `i`, `n`, and `new` remain unchanged from their initial state.
