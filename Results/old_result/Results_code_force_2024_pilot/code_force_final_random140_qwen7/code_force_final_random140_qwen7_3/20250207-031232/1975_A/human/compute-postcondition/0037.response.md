Output State: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of variable `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to the end of the list. Since the initial state does not provide the exact content of `a`, `new` is described as a slice starting from index 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid but does not affect the slicing operation directly.
