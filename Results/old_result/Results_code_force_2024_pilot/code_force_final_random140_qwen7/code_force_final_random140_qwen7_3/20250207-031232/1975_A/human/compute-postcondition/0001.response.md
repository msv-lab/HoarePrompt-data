State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. No other variables are mentioned in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.
4. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) does not guarantee that the loop will execute, as `t` could be 0 or negative. Therefore, it needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.
