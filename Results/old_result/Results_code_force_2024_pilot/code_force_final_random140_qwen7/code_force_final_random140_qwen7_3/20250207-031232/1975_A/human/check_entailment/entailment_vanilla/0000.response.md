### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes the array to check if it can be made non-decreasing.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The code first checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `all([a[i - 1] < a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' immediately.

3. **Handling Non-Non-Decreasing Arrays:**
   - If the array is not already non-decreasing, the code iterates through possible split points (from index 1 to n-1).
   - For each split point, it creates a new array `new` from the part of the original array starting from the current index.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the new array.
     - `new_all` checks if the new array itself is non-decreasing.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such split point satisfies the conditions, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is correct.
   - The initial check for a fully non-decreasing array is handled correctly.
   - The nested loop and conditional checks for the split points and their validity are implemented correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided function correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
