Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` equals `n`.
- `new` is either an empty list or a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing.
- `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all adjacent elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in increasing order.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
