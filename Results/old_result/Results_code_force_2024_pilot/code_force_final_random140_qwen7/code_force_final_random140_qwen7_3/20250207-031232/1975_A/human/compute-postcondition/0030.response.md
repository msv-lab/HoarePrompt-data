Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to their consecutive elements in `new`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any dependency on the values of `new`, `check_all`, or `new_all`.

Output: **NO**
