Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that starts from index `i` (which is 1) and includes all elements from that index to the end of the list `a`. The values of `i` and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
