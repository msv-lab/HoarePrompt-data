Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `n`, `new` is an empty list, `check_all` retains its final value determined during the last iteration of the loop, `new_all` is `None`, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables retain their previous states.
