Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. It checks if the list `a` is strictly increasing. If not, it further checks if removing the first element and checking the remaining list results in a non-decreasing list. Based on these checks, it prints 'YES' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final results for each case.**
