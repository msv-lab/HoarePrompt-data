Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `new` is either an empty list or a list starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `new_all` is either `None` or a boolean value indicating whether the elements in `new` are non-decreasing, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input using `map(int, input().split())`**.

The code updates the list `a` to a list of integers obtained from user input split by spaces and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
