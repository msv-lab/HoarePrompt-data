Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`. The postcondition checks if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element. If they are, `check_all` is True; otherwise, it is False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` does not change based on the given information, so it remains the same.

4. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The slice `new` and the postcondition (`check_all`) are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`, if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the previous element, `check_all` is True. Otherwise, `check_all` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
