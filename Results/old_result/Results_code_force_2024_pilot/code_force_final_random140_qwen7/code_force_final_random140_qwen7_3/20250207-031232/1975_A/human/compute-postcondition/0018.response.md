Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`.
- The condition `check_all and new_all` is false.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of other variables because the print statement itself does not depend on any of the conditions or variables mentioned.

Output: **NO**
