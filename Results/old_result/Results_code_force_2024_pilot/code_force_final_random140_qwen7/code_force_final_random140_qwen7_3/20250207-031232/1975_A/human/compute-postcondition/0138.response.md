Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the list `a`, `new_all` is the result of evaluating the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`, and in both cases (whether the condition `check_all and new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
