Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, and `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if not all elements in `new` are less than or equal to consecutive elements in `new`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
