Output State: **`i` is 2; `new` is a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `check_all` using a list comprehension that checks if each element in the slice `new` is less than the first element of the list `a`. Since the value of `i` is not changed and `new` remains a slice from index 2 to the end of the list `a`, these values are preserved. The value of `check_all` depends on the comparison results and is a boolean value.
